Donning stilettos, lipstick and mascara, the young men take to the streets of one of Washington DC's most violent neighborhoods. But under their clothing - and in some cases, in their Louis Vuitton bags - they are carrying knives, brass knuckles and pepper spray. Meet some of the more than 200 members of Check It, the only documented gang of gay and transgender youths in America. The teenagers and young adults, who have faced discrimination  throughout their entire lives, are the subjects of a new independent documentary. The film, also named Check It, explains how many of the youths have been stabbed or shot at, while others have served time in juvenile prisons . But now, the 'tight-knit' gang members, who are aged 14 to 22, are fighting to break the cycle of poverty and violence that they have grown up in. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Documentary star: This is one of more than 200 members of Check It, the only documented gang of gay and transgender youths in America . Impoverished area: The gang members, many of whom have been stabbed and shot at, have faced discrimination throughout their lives . Transformation: They are now the subjects of a new independent film, which tells of how some of them have served time in juvenile prisons . Dressing up: But now, the 'tight-knit' gang members (including this member), who are aged 14 to 22, are fighting to break the cycle of poverty and violence that they have grown up in. They are working on their own clothing label, putting on fashion shows and working stints as models . Contrast: The documentary describes how the gang members have to deal with violence and fights on a regular basis (left) but have now launched their own fashion label (right: a youth models for the label) in a bid to escape their 'often brutal' lives in Trinidad, Washington DC . They have set up their own clothing label and are putting on fashion shows in the north-east neighborhood, according to the film and an Indiegogo page. And some of them are even working stints as runway models. All the while, they are offering each other unconditional love and support. 'At its heart, the film explores the undying friendship that exists between these kids - an unbreakable bond that is tested every day,' the page states. However, amid their achievements, the youths often encounter setbacks, with the community they live in 'relentlessly trying to beat them down'. 'When The Check It are not taking small steps forward on the catwalk, they too often take massive steps backwards,' the page explains. The documentary follows the members, led by ex-convict Mo, as they get into fights, are ridiculed by passerbys and struggle with their fashion plans. In its trailer, Dana Flor, who co-directed the film with Toby Oppenheimer, says: 'A lot of times just being black, you have a lot of odds against you.' According to the Washingtonian, she continues: 'Being gay and black... it's like a nightmare waiting to happen.' Close: 'At its heart, the film explores the undying friendship that exists between these kids - an unbreakable bond that is tested every day' Hard life: Formed in 2005 by a group of 'bullied 9th graders', Check It now has more than 200 members, all of whom live a life that is 'brutal' Transgender: Because the youths - many of whom live transgender lives - are so close, their gang was difficult for filmmakers to infiltrate . Violence to fashion: Gang members are pictured getting into a fight (left), and participating in a fashion show (right) in the independent film . Formed in 2005 by a group of 'bullied 9th graders', Check It now has more than 200 members, all of whom live a life that is 'brutal' but also 'full of hope'. Because the youths - many of whom cross-dress or live transgender lives - are so close, the gang's structure was difficult for filmmakers to infiltrate. However, over a three-year-period, Ms Flor and Mr Oppenheimer gradually managed to immerse themselves in the members' lives in Trinidad. 'These kids have been let down by everybody in their life,' Ms Flor said. 'You have to assert them that you're for real, that you're not going to go away.' He added: 'The documentary will not only go into the challenges members face, but also depict their dream of launching a fashion line.' Actor Steve Buscemi, of New York-based Olive Productions, is producing the documentary, alongside Ms Flor and Mr Oppenheimer. Let down: 'These kids have been let down by everybody in their life... You have to assert them that you're for real, you're not going to go away' Raising money: Filmmakers are raising money to help fund the final editing stages of the film (pictured). They have so far raised $62,630 . They hope the film will expose the discrimination that the gang faces - and show the 'amazing things' the youths are capable of. They also hope it will 'encourage a similarly open-minded conversation about HIV, anti-gay discrimination, and poverty both nationally' and locally. Filmmakers are raising money to help fund the final editing stages of the film. On Saturday, they surpassed their $60,000 goal. Ten per cent of the donations will be given to the gang's fashion label. The fundraiser ends in only 10 hours; to donate, click here.

The potential domestic auction for Liverpool's Raheem Sterling this summer could decide which of Chelsea, Manchester City or Manchester United lure Gareth Bale from Real Madrid. As first revealed in Football Grapevine last month, Liverpool have put a £50million price tag on Sterling if they opt to sell the 20-year-old. Should Sterling leave for one of the Barclays Premier League's big three, then the other two will focus on trying to persuade Bale to leave Madrid. A potential domestic auction could be sparked for the purchase of Liverpool's Raheem Sterling . Chelsea, Manchester City or Manchester United are among those watching Sterling ahead of the summer . It could decide where Gareth Bale ends up if one club gets Sterling and the other two miss out . It promises to become a tangled transfer web. Bale is, from a playing and commercial point of view, a far 'safer bet' given his proven CV. But his fee of £75m and near £300,000-a-week wages mean his acquisition would restrict other signings under financial fair play guidelines. It's also the case that Bale may not agree to a return to any of the three Premier League clubs who can afford him. Indeed he has indicated he would like to continue at Madrid. But such has been the adverse reaction of many Madrid fans to him this season he may find it difficult to 'tough it out'. And the Spanish club may feel it is a good time to 'cash out'. As it stands Liverpool will not budge from their £100,000-a-week contract offer to England international Sterling, whose advisors believe he is worth about £150,000 in the current market. Liverpool will not budge from their £100,000-a-week contract offer to England international Sterling . Bale (left) pictured during a Real Madrid training session with Portugal superstar Cristiano Ronaldo . Bale's £75m  fee and near £300,000-a-week wages mean his signing would restrict clubs under FFP guidelines . The stance of the Liverpool hierarchy, though, is they will not scrap their salary ladder scale for Sterling in the belief he has not yet justified moving up to their existing top bracket of £140,000-a-week that departing Steven Gerrard has been on or Luis Suarez pocketed before leaving for Barcelona. Given that he has two years left on his existing £35,000-a-week contract, the club feel  if Sterling will not agree they should cash in, even if means selling to one of the rivals - even United. Argentine Paulo Dybala,  dubbed by Palermo president Mauricio Zamparini as 'the new Sergio Aguero', is set to be on his way to the Premier League this summer. The destination depends on the outcome of the Sterling saga but both Liverpool and Arsenal are in for the 21-year-old. Paulo Dybala, dubbed 'the new Sergio Aguero', is set to be on his way to the Premier League . The destination depends on the outcome of the Sterling saga but both Liverpool and Arsenal fancy him . The 21-year-old currently plays for Palermo in Italy but could be on his way to England this summer . Liverpool have been strongly linked with a move for Arsenal's Theo Walcott but the player's wage demands may put off the Anfield outfit. Walcott signed a near £100,000-a-week deal with the Gunners just two years ago but is already seeking improved terms to commit himself to the club for a further five years. It remains to be seen whether Arsenal are prepared to up his wages again given his appearance record over the past two years which has been hampered by more injuries. Liverpool have been strongly linked with a move for Arsenal's Theo Walcott during the summer . Walcott signed a near £100,000-a-week deal with the Gunners just two years ago but could leave London . Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers would see Walcott as an ideal replacement for Sterling but would only want to pay about the £100,000-per-week mark. If Walcott was still attracted to a move to Anfield, where he would command more regular football, then Arsene Wenger would make a move for Dybala. If Sterling goes and Walcott stays with the Gunners, Liverpool could then move in for the highly-rated Dybala. He is a centre forward who can also operate on the wing and is currently valued in the £15m bracket. Marcelo Bielsa has emerged as one of the front runners to succeed Sam Allardyce as West Ham manager. If, as seems certain, the Hammers do not give Allardyce a new contract in the summer then the club could turn to Argentine Bielsa, currently in charge of Marseille, who lie third in the French league in touching distance of leaders Lyon. Bielsa has an impressive CV having managed the national teams of both Argentina and Chile. Marcelo Bielsa could join the Premier League if he replaces West Ham manager Sam Allardyce . Bielsa and Hernan Crespo relax before Argentina's ill-fated 2002 World Cup campaign . Among the clubs he has managed include Athletic Bilbao in Spain, where he earned a reputation of promoting exciting football in a 3-3-3-1 formation. He is regarded as a progressive attacking coach with both Diego Simeone and Mauricio Pochettino  influenced by the 59-year-old. But the appointment of Bielsa would still be a gamble by West Ham. Allardyce may not be handed a new contract during the summer by West Ham when his current deal expires . Bielsa could replace Allardyce if his current contract is not extended by Premier League club West Ham . Over the years he has earned the nickname EL Loco - 'The Mad One'. His command of English is limited and he has little knowledge of the Premier League. The need for West Ham not to even be close to a relegation battle in their last season at the Boleyn Ground before moving to the Olympic Stadium, is obvious. Other contenders on West Ham's long list include Slaven Bilic, Rafa Benitez, Brian Laudrup, Frank Rijkaard and David Moyes. Once Manchester United have completed the long-mooted move for Mats Hummels from Borussia Dortmund at the end of the season, they will - as also predicted here - set their sights on Southampton's right back Nathaniel Clyne. It has been suggested United will offer striker Javier Hernandez, currently on loan at Real Madrid, as part of the deal to land by Clyne. But West Ham are also interested in signing Hernandez. Manchester United will set their sights on Southampton's right back Nathaniel Clyne this summer . United are set to complete their highly anticipated move for Mats Hummels from Borussia Dortmund . Chelsea are set to move in for Queens Park Rangers goalkeeper Rob Green to act as No 2 to Thibaut Courtois with Petr Cech on his way out of Stamford Bridge. Arsenal and Liverpool have been linked with Cech. Chelsea would prefer to sell £10m-rated Cech abroad. Real Madrid or Paris Saint-Germain are likely to be in the market. Chelsea are set to move in for QPR goalkeeper Rob Green to replace Petr Cech at Stamford Bridge . I am hearing . While on England duty Sterling was urged by several around the camp to take a step back and consider the potential downsides of leaving Liverpool at this stage of his career, even if he will land bigger wages for the time being. I hear it was even put to Sterling that the saga now unfolding is more in the short-term interest of his advisor Aidy Ward than his long-term progression as a player. Indeed the Liverpool player should look at what happened to Shaun Wright-Phillips a decade ago. Sterling was reportedly urged by people in the England camp to sit back and think before leaving Anfield . It was in 2005 that Wright-Phillips left Manchester City - before they were big time - for Chelsea in a £21m deal, which was massive at the time. At the time 23-year-old Wright-Phillips looked as though he could be a world beater. But he was never a regular at City and his hugely promising career both at club level and England never reached its potential. Now at QPR, 33-year-old Wright-Phillips has made one Premier League appearance this season. Shaun Wright-Phillips left City for Chelsea in a £21m deal in 2005 but he never reached his potential . I am also hearing . The Football Association, Premier League and the PFA will seek medical advice as to the safety of vanishing spray for free kicks which has been banned in Germany's Bundesliga on health grounds on the basis it is 'hormonally active'. Germany's Bundesliga banned the vanishing spray on health grounds on the basis it is 'hormonally active'
Uber has poached Facebook's security chief Joe Sullivan in an attempt to double down on rapidly escalating safety concerns. The $40 billion taxi service has been plagued by serious accusations of failing to vet its drivers. Lawsuits have been brought against Uber in San Francisco and Los Angeles. A New Delhi driver was accused of raping a passenger in December. This week in Denver, a driver tried and failed to break into a passenger's home. And in London, a woman was allegedly asked to perform oral sex on her driver. These claims, among others, follow a data leak last May, which saw the details of 50,000 current and former drivers released into the public domain. It is hoped Sullivan, the first federal prosecutor to specialize in high-technology crime, can protect Uber from potentially crippling ramifications. Lifeline? Joe Sullivan, 46, will leave his role as Facebook's security chief to help Uber defend safety concerns . There were three high-profile assault cases involving Uber drivers in December 2014. An Indian woman said her driver raped her in New Delhi, leading to outcries and a temporary ban of Uber in that city. It came days after a driver was charged in Boston with raping a young woman. The same week, a woman in London revealed that she was offered £20 credit from Uber after one of its drivers allegedly sexually harassed her during a cab ride. This week in Denver an UberX driver was arrested after he dropped a passenger off at the airport before allegedly driving back to her house, and trying to break in. The cities of San Francisco and Los Angeles are both suing the company for 'misleading the public' by failing to conduct thorough backgrounds checks. The firm's first security chief, he brings with him an extensive portfolio of experience in cyber security and privacy. He spent two decades tackling cyber crime security in the private and public sector before joining the Justice Department. Cases included child protection, bank privacy, and digital strands of 9/11 investigations. Since, he has headed up the security departments at eBay, PayPal, and Facebook. Though his experience lies in digital protection, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick has also entrusted the 46-year-old with tackling physical security. Sullivan's role will involve liaising with city and state governments around the world as the firm rapidly expands. Announcing the hire in a blog post on Thursday Kalanick wrote: 'We are both in cyberspace and on city streets all at once; a bridge between bits and atoms. 'And as we get into tens of millions of rides a week, we continue to challenge ourselves to do even better when it comes to safety and data security.' He added: 'This is a challenge where I get to take what makes Silicon Valley special and apply it to a product that directly impacts people's lives everyday as they move around the world's cities.' Allegations: The rapidly-expanding mobile taxi service has been plagued by claims that drivers are not vetted . Looking forward: The $40 billion firm's CEO Travis Kalanick announced the news in a blog post on Friday . There were three high-profile assault cases involving Uber drivers in December 2014. An Indian woman said her driver raped her in New Delhi, leading to outcries and a temporary ban of Uber in that city. It came days after a driver was charged in Boston with raping a young woman.

Talk about gobby! This little fellow has been born with FIVE mouths - believed to be the most ever seen on a calf. The strange-looking baby opens all ten lips when he is sucking at his mother's udders. But he can only take in milk through two of his mouths. He is being fed three times a day at the dairy farm where he was born, in Narnaul, northern India. Scroll down for video . On everyone's lips: This calf in northern India has five mouths and is attracting a stream of human visitors . Normal body: From the neck down the baby, who has been called Nandi, looks like any other calf . Dinner time: Nandi sucks from his mother's udders with one of his mouths. She feeds him three times a day . Shocked locals have called the calf Nandi - a nickname for Lord Krishna. It can also mean 'one who pleases others'. In India's Hindu culture, cows are revered as a symbol of life. Nandi is attracting a constant stream of visitors wanting to celebrate him. Many of them kneel before him to pray and touch his hooves. Local vet Sukhbir Singh said that despite Nandi's appearance, he is healthy and thriving. But the calf's two eyes are positioned in such a way on his distorted head that he can only see to his sides and can't look in front of him. One eye is blue and the other black. Other strange-looking bovine have been recorded in recent years, including a buffalo with three mouths and three eyes that was in in 2009, also in northern India, in 2009. Last month a bull with two faces - one on top the other - was sold to an abattoir in Queensland, Australia. The 440kg animal fetched around £300 in the auction at Mareeba Livestock Yard. Celebrating him: Local schoolchildren kneel and pray at Nandi's feet. Cows are revered in the Hindu faith . Garlanded: Wreaths such as those around the calf's neck are traditionally used in India during worship . Baby teeth: One of Nandi's mouths is clearly bigger than the others, which hang around his face . Two years ago, an American farm revealed it had a calf with two heads but only one brain. Vets said the little heifer, in Whiting, Vermont, was meant to be a twin but the egg did not separate properly in the womb. Each head mimicked the other, meaning when she was feeding with one of her mouths, her other mouth was sucking too. Two-faced: This 440kg bull, which has faces on top of each other, was sold to an abattoir last month . Double-headed: The female calf born that was born in Whiting, Vermont, two years ago . Tired out: Both her mouths sucked at the same time because they were operated by a single brain .
Tony Pulis insists West Brom chairman Jeremy Peace has given him his word any takeover will not drag on. Owner Peace is open to offers for the Baggies and is understood to want between £150million and £200million for the club. There is interest from groups from America, Australia and China with Peace setting a June deadline to seal any deal. Tony Pulis insists he has been told by the West Brom chairman that any takeover will not drag on . The Baggies are currently fighting to avoid relegation from the Premier League, and face Liverpool next . And, ahead of Saturday's visit of Liverpool, Pulis does not expect a long saga. He said: 'He's (Peace) given us that promise that he won't be hanging round, if there's an offer there and there's a deal to be done he'll want it done before a certain date and if that doesn't happen then he'll commit himself to the club again. 'I think he wants it to be with the right people. I don't think he wants to sell it to just anybody, they have to be the right people who are going to invest and look after the club. 'He's spent a lot of time here and invested a lot of money into the football club to put it where it is. If you look at the stadium, the academy set up, the training ground facilities and everything else. 'This club has moved on very well and they make a profit every year. So he hasn't done too bad a job.' West Brom chairman Jeremy Peace is open to offers for the Midlands club, but will not let a takeover drag on . Pulis praised West Brom forward Saido Berahino, who has recently been in the news for all the wrong reasons . Pulis also dismissed any worries over Saido Berahino after the striker was shown again inhaling nitrous oxide in a picture taken a year ago. The striker joined Aston Villa's Jack Grealish and Liverpool's Raheem Sterling in having pictures or video of them taking the legal high emerge. Berahino was first shown last year taking the substance and a second picture appeared this week but the Baggies are understood to be happy with the striker's version of events. 'You would have to explain to me what they are doing because I haven't got a clue,' said Pulis. 'It looks like some balloon or something. 'That picture was a year ago. He has been fantastic since I came into the club. 'I've had no problems with him at all and he's played well, and fingers crossed he's going to go to the tournament in the summer with England Under-21s and he will be a big asset to that team. Berahino arrives at Selhurst Park ahead of West Brom's win over Crystal Palace last weekend . Berahino will this weekend come up against Raheem Sterling, who has also been in trouble off the pitch . 'If you watch us train, after every session there will be two or three out there and he will be one of them, doing extra work and he's been first class.' Berahino will face Sterling at The Hawthorns on Saturday and Pulis, who is without the suspended Youssouf Mulumbu and ineligible Andre Wisdom, is looking forward to the showdown. 'They will play and it will be interesting,' he said. 'Sterling has been outstanding. Saido is a little bit behind in some respects but you have to understand and recognise that one of them is playing at a really top club and there is a difference in standard, without a doubt.'
Archaeologists have discovered a previously unknown stretch of the Great Wall of China in the northwestern of the country, thought to date back more than 2,000 years. Experts say the new 6.2 mile-stretch (10 kilometres) means the full range of the Qin Dynasty Great Wall can be traced for the first time. Nine sections of the Wall have been found over the last two months along the inner coast of the Yellow River in Gansu province and the Ningxia region, reported the People's Daily online. Still standing: New sections of the Great Wall discovered by a team of experts in northwestern China . Historic: This stretch, measuring more than 6 miles long, is thought to date back more than 2,000 years . Remote: The ruins range along the inner coast of the Yellow River in Gansu province and the Ningxia region . The new stretch, ranging between Jingyuan County and Nanchangtan village, was discovered by a team led by Zhou Xinghua, renowned Great Wall researcher and the former head of Ningxia Museum. Historical documents had suggested that the Emperor Qin ordered for the Great Wall to start in Gansu province and run east into the Ningxia region and Inner Mongolia, but physical evidence in this particular area has never been found until now. Mr Zhou said China's first emperor ordered for the stretch to be built along the Yellow River to stop invaders crossing it when it was frozen. While parts of the Great Wall date back to about 700 BC, the first complete Wall was built during the reign of China's first emperor, Qin Shihuang, from about 220 BC after the country had been unified for the first time. The newly discovered section of the wall was constructed using stones and rammed earth, with some parts built on top of the mountain ranges and others running along valleys. Some of the ruins are only three feet high due to natural degradation, but originally the wall could have been as tall as 20 feet. Other sections: Archive photos of the Qin Dynasty Great Wall which is thought to be built around 215 AD . Landmark: A monument is placed near the ruins of the Qin Dynasty Great Wall, which was built by the first emperor to have unified China . There are no surviving records of the exact length of the Qin Wall, and much of the original wall has eroded away leaving few sections behind. The Great Wall is actually made up of many different structures built across northern China and southern Mongolia over a number of dynasties. The best known and most visible section today is the Ming Wall, constructed from 1368 to 1644. The formidable fortress covers approximately 5,500 miles from the Jiayu Pass in Gansu province and the Shanhai Pass in Hebei province. However, it was revealed in 2012 that the Wall is actually 13,170 miles  long – more than double the previous estimate. A Chinese university is spending nearly £450,000 on building their very own Great Wall of China. Wuhan Institute of Bioengineering is currently constructing the replica as a patriotic educational tool that will also get students doing more exercise, according to the People's Daily Online. The 'Campus Great Wall' will act as a walkway that connects the university's two sites, covering a distance of 1.6 kilometres – more than 13,000 times shorter than the original. Replica: Students at the Wuhan Institute of Bioengineering are climbing their own Great Wall on campus . The university said the project, which is yet to be completed, is 'not a cheap replica' and the wall looks to copy the original as closely as possible. The project aims to provide students with an opportunity to get to grips with the country's rich cultural history through copies of carvings from the original, as well as famous paintings and poems. A spokesman for the university said in a statement: 'It fulfils a patriotic educational purpose as the Great Wall is a historic achievement by the Chinese people'.
At two kilometres in circumference and protected by an imposing 12-metre wall, the Ming Dynasty's 'Martial City' had a reputation that struck fear into opposing armies. So much so that battle plans would be drawn up to specifically give the castle at Zhangjiakou, in China's northern Hebei province, a wide berth. Now archaeologists have begun a daunting project to restore the once-mighty site to something approaching it previous glory, in particular the dilapidated outer wall that repelled every attack which invading Mongolian armies could throw at it. Among the works being carried out at Wanquan Castle is the restoration of the fortress' dilapidated outer wall . Workers restore the southern barbican entrance to Wanquan Castle, which was known as the Ming Dynasty's 'Martial City' The fortress was built in 1393 and managed to repel all attacks by the invading Mongolian armies . The fortress measures some two kilometres in circumference and was protected by an imposing 12-metre wall . The restoration of the fortress - which was given the coveted title of 'Wucheng' or 'Martial City' after its construction in 1393 - will see building work completed in the original Ming Dynasty style of architecture, reports People's Daily Online. The project will see the restoration of the Ming and Qing era commercial districts, the Great Wall Martial Museum, the Golden Harvest Academy and performance theatres as well as the opening of the Red Tourist Route, with all work planned to be complete in 2016. The restoration work will also include the ongoing protection of surviving structures. The castle in Wanquan county - known in China as a 'living fossil of the Ming military system' - was built in 1393 but is relatively well-preserved, especially the interior city area which includes the residences of generals and wealthy merchants. The fortress has huge historical, cultural and military significance and has key cultural relic status in China. While much of the interior city is in good condition, the outer wall is somewhat dilapidated and will be the focus of much of the work . The restoration work, which is due to be completed next year, will where possible be carried out in the style of Ming Dynasty architecture . The Ming Dynasty ruled China for 276 years, between the years 1368 and 1644, and is often described as the last of the great Chinese dynasties. During the era large scale architectural and civil engineering projects were created or expanded, including the Great Wall of China, the Grand Canal and the Forbidden City, located in Beijing. It took 15 years to build, using more than one million workers, and has almost 1,000 buildings. Art flourished during the Ming Dynasty, which saw an explosion of literature, painting, poetry, music and porcelain - with Ming vases and plates valuable collector items to this day. Following popular uprising and rebellions across China, the Chinese army was defeated and the Ming Dynasty collapsed when its last emperor Chongzhen hanged himself on a tree in the imperial garden outside the Forbidden City, in 1644.

The mass brawl which broke out at a bar opening inside a Queens casino Friday night was allegedly caused by an argument in an enormous line for drinks. Hundreds of patrons hoping for an iced daiquiri at the debut of a Fat Tuesdays bar inside the Resort World Casino ended up at each other's throats when the party went sour. According to a casino worker, the fighting goes back to two women who clashed during the long wait for alcohol, dragging their group of friends into the conflict. Scroll down for video . Chairs in the air: An enormous fight broke out at a bar opening at Resorts World casino in Queens, New York . Bar brawl: Video posted on twitter showed angry patrons attacking one another . The fisticuffs escalated, with guests grabbing chairs and poles to bring to the fray, as security guards rushed in to try to calm the brawlers down. Bystanders uploaded cell phone footage of the ugly brawl, which broke out around 10.30pm, to social media. Running gangs of fighters can be seen storming through the halls of the casino, shouting profanities at one another. A witness, Elize Brown, told CBS2 New York: 'It was chairs flying everywhere — it was chaotic. 'It was nerve-wracking. It was like you don't know what the next thing that was going to happen was.'

An investigation is underway after two passengers were allegedly seen making frequent visits to the cockpit during a Ryanair flight from Dublin to Berlin Schönefeld. Two women, who were believed to be off-duty Ryanair members of staff wearing their staff lanyards, were passengers on the plane and were not wearing their uniform. The Irish Aviation Authority has decided to probe the incident, which took place on Good Friday, after fellow passengers on board expressed their concerns about the behaviour. The Irish Aviation Authority are investigating after two female passengers were allowed in the cockpit of a Ryanair flight mid-flight . Speaking to Independent.ie a passenger named Bridget who was travelling on the flight spoke of how once the plane had taken off, two women were spotted coming out of the cockpit. Ryanair has since confirmed there were a total of three off-duty workers on board the flight. The passenger also claimed she had seen the two women 'drinking in the airport' before the flight out. She said: 'Later, when the captain said 'we're getting ready to descend', the two girls went back up. They were laughing and giggling and taking photos of each other. The actions of the two women in visiting the cockpit, who have since been revealed as off-duty Ryanair staff, left fellow passengers on board concerned (file photo, not actual cockpit) 'With things being so strict since the (Germanwings) Alps crash, I don't think this should be allowed.' A Ryanair spokesperson told MailOnline Travel: 'We have investigated this matter. These were three Ryanair employees travelling off duty. 'All three were wearing their Ryanair ID and were known to the flight crew. 'Following the investigation the matter is now closed.' A spokesperson for the Irish Aviation Authority told MailOnline Travel: 'The IAA is currently investigating the incident in question. 'In general access to the cockpit is restricted to operational staff, including staff passengers, provided they are known to the Commander.'
The rampant Scottish National Party has extended its huge lead over Labour, polling showed last night. Detailed constituency surveys suggest Labour faces an unprecedented wipeout. Jim Murphy, its Scottish leader, and Douglas Alexander, its chief election strategist, are among those on course to lose their seats. Jim Murphy (left), Labour's Scottish leader, and Douglas Alexander (right), the party's chief election strategist could lose their seats . The nationalists are also on course to wipe out the Liberal Democrats in Scotland, with even Charles Kennedy, their popular former leader, now 15 points behind in his Highlands constituency. The survey of eight constituencies, by Lord Ashcroft, revealed swings to the SNP on a scale which would be unprecedented in modern European politics. The survey suggests Labour could lose all 41 seats it won in 2010. Tactical anti-SNP voting by supporters of other parties could save some. There are 59 seats in Scotland. Mr Murphy is nine points behind in his East Renfrewshire seat with the SNP buoyed by leader Nicola Sturgeon’s strong performance in two TV debates. That means there has been a 26.5 per cent swing away from Labour since 2010. Labour conceded that ‘no gloss’ could be put on the polls and warned that if the findings become reality then ‘David Cameron will walk back into Downing Street again’. Conor Pope, of party supporters’ website LabourList, said: ‘If previous Ashcroft constituency polling in Scotland could be described as an earthquake, the poll the Tory peer had dropped this afternoon will require an entirely different word. A cataclysm perhaps. ‘If this is an earthquake it’s certainly not the kind that rattles the windows in the middle of the night, it’s the sort that razes whole cities. ‘If Lord Ashcroft’s polling is correct, there’s a risk that Jim Murphy could lose his seat to the SNP. At the last poll he had a slender one point lead over the SNP, that has now turned in a matter of weeks into a nine-point lead for the SNP. That’s well outside the margin of error. The rampant Scottish National Party, led by Nicola Sturgeon (pictured), has extended its lead over Labour . ‘What was once a Labour/Tory marginal could well fall to the forces of separatism. Such a result would be a painful – almost existential – blow to a Scottish Labour Party that is already battered and bruised.’ Yesterday, Mr Murphy launched a desperate attempt to regain support by abandoning his Blairite views in a bid to win over left-wing voters. Mr Murphy unveiled Labour’s Scottish election manifesto in Glasgow as he declared ‘the party of John Smith and the party of Donald Dewar is back in business’. Overlooking the Tony Blair ‘New Labour’ era, during which he served as a minister, he allowed retiring Labour MP David Hamilton to whip the crowd into a frenzy by attacking Margaret Thatcher and laying into the SNP with the battle cry: ‘They are nationalists, we are socialists.’ Mr Murphy himself vowed to introduce socialist-style ‘redistributive’ policies, as he accused the SNP of stealing Labour’s clothes.
Yoko Ono has led the tributes to John Lennon's first wife Cynthia calling her a 'wonderful mother' with a 'strong zest for life' after she died at the age of 75 following a short battle with cancer. The second wife of the Beatles singer said she was 'very saddened' by the news, adding that she was 'proud' how she and Cynthia had 'stood firm in the Beatles family'. Cynthia, who married Lennon after meeting him in college, died yesterday at her home in Spain. A message on her son Julian's website said he was at her beside throughout, and the family 'are thankful for your prayers'. Scroll down for video . Yoko Ono has led the tributes to John Lennon's first wife Cynthia, posting this photo of the two women with their sons Sean and Julian. She wrote underneath: 'When we were very happy together' Cynthia Lennon, who died at her home in Spain yesterday, later penned memoirs of her time with her famous husband, who eventually left her for Yoko Ono . This memorial website set up for her by her family carried an image of her surrounded by a love heart and a brief statement explaining she had died after a 'short but brave' battle with cancer . In the statement, Yoko said: 'I'm very saddened by Cynthia's death. She was a great person and a wonderful mother to Julian. 'She had such a strong zest for life and I felt proud how we two women stood firm in the Beatles family. Please join me in sending love and support to Julian at this very sad time.' Yoko also posted a picture which had been taken in 2010 of the two women with their sons, Julian and Sean. She captioned the picture: 'When we were very happy together.' Cynthia Lennon, nee Powell, married Lennon in 1962 and stayed with him as he rose to global stardom with The Beatles until the couple divorced in 1968. But the pair divorced in 1968 after Cynthia discovered her husband's relationship with the Japanese artist. Former Beatles Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr added their condolences. Writing on his website, McCartney, 72, said: 'She was a lovely lady who I've known since our early days together in Liverpool. She was a good mother to Julian and will be missed by us all, but I will always have great memories of our times together.'

Starr, 74, tweeted: 'Peace and love to Julian Lennon God bless Cynthia love Ringo and Barbara xx.' John Lennon and Cynthia met at college and married just as Lennon's career with The Beatles propelled him to fame. Julian also tweeted a picture of his mother, who was 75, inside a heart with the message 'In Loving Memory'. He also posted a moving video tribute to his late mother with a song he had written in her honor. 'You gave your life for me, you gave your life for love,' it begins, showing footage of him as a young boy with his parents. It also shows footage of Cynthia with John during the early days of Beatlemania. 'The love you left behind will carry on,' Julian sings in a style influenced by his late father. It concludes with the words: 'I know you're safe above.' Cynthia met Lennon at art school in Liverpool in 1957 and the couple married just before Beatlemania transformed her husband from a jobbing musician into one of the most famous men in the world. At the height of the Beatles' early success, she was kept so far in the background that many of Lennon's female fans were not even aware of her existence, and she stayed at home bringing up Julian while the Fab Four toured the world and topped the charts. Cynthia Lennon pictured with The Beatles in 1964 during their rose to global stardom . The couple (pictured together left and right in 1964) divorced in 1968 after Cynthia discovered her husband's relationship with Yoko Ono . Cynthia Lennon grew up in a middle-class community on the Wirral, met John Lennon while they were both students at the Liverpool College of Art. The pair married in 1962, when Cynthia was just 22, after she became pregnant with their son Julian. Beatles' members George Harrison, Paul McCartney, and The Beatles' manager, Brian Epstein - who was best man - all attended. The Lennons bought Kenwood, then a 22-bedroom home, in Weybridge, Surrey, for £20,000 in 1964. Kenwood became the place to visit for the other Beatles, various American musicians and total strangers that Lennon had met the previous night in London nightclubs. While she had suspicions of Lennon's infidelity over the years, with friends telling her that Lennon had had numerous affairs as far back as their time together at art college in Liverpool, Cynthia ignored the warnings. The Lennons' marriage troubles came to a head in February 1968 when Lennon drunkenly confessed to sleeping with other women during their marriage. Lennon suggested Cynthia take a holiday with friends. She returned to find her husband sitting across from Yoko Ono on the floor - staring into each other's eyes. In one of her book's she wrote that she then found Yoko's slippers outside their bedroom door - shocked and upset she left the house to stay with friends. The couple share a laugh together in 1964. Cynthia later described her role in their relationship as like a 'walk on part' In later years, Cynthia wrote in her book of how she was mistreated by Lennon as he soared to fame . The Beatles' only authorised biographer, Hunter Davies, said the couple's friends at art school never thought the relationship would last because they were such different characters . Cynthia Lennon, pictured in 1968, divorced from the hit songwriter after he met Yoko Ono . After years of trouble, the marriage finally ended in August 1968 when Yoko Ono discovered she was pregnant. Fearing a lengthy divorce process, the couple settled outside of court, with Lennon agreeing to pay Cynthia £100,000 and give her custody of Julian. The divorce prompted Paul McCartney to pen the Beatles' classic Hey Jude to help Julian cope with his parents' separation. He changed the name Julian to Jude in the song. The line 'take a sad song and make it better,' is about the Lennons' broken marriage and its impact on their son. Cynthia learned of Lennon's death on 8 December 1980, while she was staying with friends in London. She married Italian hotelier Roberto Bassanini in 1970, divorcing him in 1973. In 1976, she married John Twist, an engineer from Lancashire, but divorced him in 1983. In an interview to publicise one of her books, 2005's John, she told Good Morning America: 'I have read so many books and seen so many films, and it's like we don't really exist. We are like walk-on parts in his life. We did spend 10 years together.' Recalling their early days, she said: 'You couldn't resist being around him. You couldn't resist watching what he was up to. I mean, he was a total rebel. Everybody was amazed by him.' Author Hunter Davies, who wrote the only authorized Beatles biography in 1968, described Cynthia as a 'lovely woman'. He said that unlike John, she was 'quiet and reserved and calm' and 'not a hippy at all.' He said their friends at art school never thought the relationship would last because they were so different. In her book, Cynthia described being mistreated by John. Julian was their only child together. He said: 'When I was writing the book I spent two years with them, visiting her home and spending time with her. 'I think it was the attraction of opposites between them. When they got together at art school everyone was amazed - she was seen as refined and reserved and nobody thought they would last. A never-before-seen dossier detailing the bitter breakdown of John Lennon's marriage to his first wife Cynthia was uncovered in February after nearly 50 years. The five-page document, drafted by the solicitors dealing with the Beatle's divorce in 1968, reveals details of his increasing drug use and his affair with Yoko Ono. It centres on claims made by Dorothy Jarlett, Lennon's housekeeper of four years, on what she saw while working at the Lennon family home Kenwood in Weybridge, Surrey. The papers detail his mood swings, aggressive behaviour towards his young son Julian and heated arguments between him and Cynthia. Mrs Jarlett describes how Yoko Ono would visit the country pile while Cynthia was out of the country, and how she once found the pair in bed together. She reveals how Lennon became nonchalant towards his wife around 1967 - five years after they tied the knot - when the Beatles were at the height of their fame. She said Lennon was uninterested in playing the father figure role and that he would smack Julian if he misbehaved. The statement was made to Herbert Oppenheimer, Nathan and Vandyk - a firm of solicitors in London employed by Cynthia following the breakdown of the marriage. The document has never been seen before because Lennon and Cynthia settled out of court, with Lennon agreeing to pay her £100,000 and give her custody of Julian.

It's a lot better, getting off the crutches, out of the brace and being able to move more on the bike and do some work in the pool. 'I couldn't move my leg for a month or so after the operation. I was at 90 degrees and I couldn't really do any more, but doing work where I can move now is good. Last week was the first time I went in the pool and there'll be a lot more new stuff to come as well.'

Police were making their final security checks outside St. Mary's Hospital in Paddington today, as the birth of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's second child approaches. With Kate's due date is just over three days away, officers were out in force, pulling lamp posts apart as they scoured the area for anything troubling. The police were watched by a small but growing group of royal fans, many of whom had set up camp on a set of benches and had decorated the area with posters and bunting. Scroll down for video . Ready to go: John Loughrey takes a nap on his makeshift bed outside the Lindo Wing in Paddington . Patriotic: Royal fan Terry Hut takes a break on Mr Loughrey's bench . Festive: Mr Hut sits with another veteran royal fan, Margaret Tyler, 71 . Leading the pack was a familiar face, that of self-confessed royal 'superfan' John Loughery, 60, who camped out overnight ahead of the 2011 Royal Wedding and was the only member of the public to attend every day of the inquest into the death of Princess Diana in 2008. Mr Loughery, a former chef, said at the time he hoped to go down in history for the feat and told the BBC that he wouldn't be surprised 'if a portrait of me is hanging inside Kensington Palace in 100 years from now'. Today, he was more concerned about the Queen and her 89th birthday and happily showed off a handmade sign wishing her many happy returns. Along with group of fellow fans, Mr Loughery went on to delight the world's media - many of whom have gathered but have so far had little to do - with a chorus of Happy Birthday. Happy Birthday: Mr Loughrey holds up a sign wishing the Queen a very happy 89th . Serenade: Mr Loughrey, Mr Hut and fellow fans also serenaded the monarch - and the Press - with a song . Decoration: Mr Loughrey and Mr Hut also came prepared with a selection of royal-themed decorations . Something to do: The Press, who have had little to do so far, happily filmed the waiting fans . Nearly there: The Duchess of Cambridge, pictured last month, is due to give birth on the 25th April . Also watching proceedings was royal fan Terry Hut, 79, who, in his Union flag suit, umbrella hat and sunglasses, provided the grey London street with a bright splash of colour. Mr Hut, who came prepared with Prince and Princess balloons, is a veteran of several royal births and spent 12 days camping outside the Lindo Wing ahead of Prince George's birth. Equally serious about the Royal Family is Margaret Tyler, 71, an avid collector of royal memorabilia who has amassed a trove worth more than £10,000. Mrs Tyler, who gave birth to her son Andrew at the Lindo Wing, says she considers the royals to be part of her family and has been following their exploits for more than 40 years. Her collection of royal souvenirs, which includes a £1,200 bust of Prince Charles, is so vast, it takes up four rooms in her small terraced home in London. Memorabilia: Mrs Tyler, who has a royal collection worth £10,000, came prepared with a Kate figurine . Cheerful: Despite their long wait, the group all appeared to be in good spirits . Ready for action: Mr Hut and Mr Loughrey both came prepared with balloons and signs . Serious business: While the royal fans sang, the police conducted a search of the area . Like Mr Loughery and Mr Hut, Mrs Tyler was also at the Lindo Wing for the birth of Prince George and ended up spending six days waiting for him to arrive. 'I was there for six days,' she told a recent episode of BBC2 show Collectaholics. '[My son] Andrew was born at St. Mary's and I was only there for two days. 'I just wanted to feel close to them [William and Kate], I suppose. I spent the time meeting people, and chatting. I was convinced it was going to be a girl, but it wasn't.' The Duchess of Cambridge, who is currently at Kensington Palace, is expected to give birth within days and is due on the 25th April. Today, Kensington Palace announced that her husband Prince William had completed his Air Ambulance training early, freeing him up to be with his wife and avoiding a two-hour hospital dash from Norfolk. Checks: They scoured the area for anything undesirable, watched by press and fans . Final preparations: The Duchess is due to give birth in just over three days . Thorough: The police even searched inside the lamp posts outside the Lindo Wing . Careful: The security searches at the Lindo Wing took most of the morning .
Hull bounced back from Thursday's derby defeat to Hull KR to snatch a surprise 28-20 victory at Langtree Park, condemning St Helens to a third straight defeat. A long-distance Jamie Shaul try was enough to seal a win that shocked the home side, who appeared to be hanging on after their Good Friday exertions. The injury-hit champions - who were in the wars again last week, losing to rivals Wigan - started with two teenage debutants in their three-quarters, and Hull sensed that there were some seams to pick at. Fetuli Talanoa (left) celebrates scoring against St Helens as Hull recorded a shock victory . Hull took an early lead after forcing a repeat set from a fumbled high kick and then another from offside on the line. That pressure finally told when Joe Westerman and Leon Pryce combined to create the space for Shaul to slip through. Jordan Rankin added the extras to make it 6-0. A Saints penalty from a high tackle put them in a good attacking spot and from there nice work from Lance Hohaia and James Roby sent the supporting Tommy Makinson skipping through. Makinson tagged on the two to level the match. And Saints were soon back for more and this time a lovely short ball from Jordan Turner sent Louie McCarthy-Scarsbrook powering over the whitewash, with Makinson adding the goal . Tom Makinson, who brought Saints level after Shaul's early try, breaks away from two tacklers . The to-and-fro nature continued and a pair of Hull penalties gave them a great position to have another crack at the line with wing Curtis Naughton just managing to get the ball down despite tackle of Bailey to cut the deficit to 12-10 on 24 minutes. Saints very nearly hit right back with fresh-legged Alex Walmsley believing he had cashed in on a Hull dropped ball with a try, only for the in-goal touch judge to rule a knock on in the build up. Saints made a tactical switch at the break, with youngster Bailey withdrawn and the backline reshuffled. Hull hit the front eight minutes into the second half when former Saint Leon Pryce made a telling intervention, attacking the line and getting the ball down despite the tackle. Rankin's goal made it 16-12 to the visitors. Saints almost hit back immediately with a great break by Roby carving open the Hull defence, but although that play was foiled on the line they were soon back for more. Joe Westerman and Mark Minichiello stop Andre Savelio as Hull recorded a vital win at St Helens . And from a penalty on 54 minutes Turner, playing against his former club, showed some determination in driving towards the posts. Makinson improved to put Saints 18-16 ahead. Saints did suffer a stroke of bad luck when Adam Swift pieced the Hull left flank and was looking dangerous but then lost the ball. Hull forced an error when Hohaia was adjudged to have knocked on a high Pryce kick. From there the visitors piled on the pressure and that finally told when a floated wide ball sent Fetuli Talanoa over on 66 minutes. Rankin missed the goal but Hull had a two-point lead and looked determined to defend it. The visitors' defence holds firm to stop Josh Jones breaking through as Jordan Rankin brings him down . A penalty from a high tackle allowed Makinson to level from 30 metres nine minutes from time, but the Saints were hanging on. After a high kick was caught and returned quickly by Swift, Saints were soon back on the front foot, but a fumble by Ashworth on the halfway line turned the ball over. Hull countered ruthlessly with Shaul showing a great turn of pace and nimble footwork to turn Makinson inside out to run in from halfway. Rankin goaled and to compound Saints' misery the restart kick went out on the full. Hull worked their way down field with Rankin slotting another penalty to make the game safe with three minutes to play.
John Carver knows only too well that a Tyne-Wear derby can make or break a manager. His first in the dugout was as assistant to Ruud Gullit in August, 1999, when on a sodden night at St James' Park the Dutchman left out Alan Shearer and Duncan Ferguson and paid for his selection with his job after a 2-1 defeat. Carver is now fighting to win the head coach position beyond the end of this season and knows what impact a victory – or a loss – could have on Sunday afternoon. John Carver is relishing the chance to take charge of his hometown club against Sunderland on Sunday . Gullit controversially decided not to start star players Duncan Ferguson and Alan Shearer in 1999 . Carver was assistant to former Newcastle manager Ruud Gullit who managed the club between 1998 and 1999 . His memories of Gullit's downfall remind him of such consequences. 'We were at the old training ground at Durham Cricket Club and I was in the room with Steve Clarke and Ruud,' recalls Carver. 'All of a sudden, he started talking about what the team was going to be against Sunderland. I said, 'Sorry Ruud, what did you say there?'. 'He said he was going to leave out Alan and Duncan. I said, 'Do you know how important this game is?'. 'He said, 'I have played in some massive derbies. I've played in them in Holland and London and I played in the Milan derby too'. 'I said, 'Yeah, but you haven't played in one like this Ruud'. 'And then we just walked out of the room. He seemed set on the fact that was what he was going to do. 'I talked about it being a motivation for the opposition seeing Alan and Duncan on the bench. But he had no concerns whatsoever. 'I actually thought, 'If we don't win it, he's gone'. I said to Steve, 'Is he writing his resignation before the game?'. Gullit's selection gambit did not pay off and Newcastle ended up losing 2-1 to Sunderland at St James' Park . 'We actually went 1-0 up but they turned it around and then the heavens opened. It was a dreadful night.' The following morning Shearer went to see Gullit, only Ferguson had beaten him to it, knocking the door off the hinges, legend has it. By the end of the week he had quit. Carver was also by Alan Pardew's side during the last four derby defeats, a factor the former manager admits did him little favours with the Toon Army. In that respect, Carver knows how much a positive result could aid his chances of landing the job on a permanent basis. 'In the eyes of the fans, if you win a derby game, it's massive,' he said. 'I'm not saying everything else is forgotten, but it certainly helps your case. If I come off and it's not been a football match but we win 1-0, I'll be delighted with that. 'We had a good football match last weekend (2-1 defeat at home to Arsenal) and got nothing for it. At the end of the day, it's all about getting the win.' Carver was also assistant manager to Alan Pardew, who lost four successive games against Sunderland .
Whatever you call them, it's always something of a surprise when a game between the biggest and best teams in any country actually turns out to be a footballing classic. Real Madrid and Barcelona attract viewers, but the cynicism on the pitch can drown out the quality in El Clasico. Borussia Dortmund are not consistently good enough to make Der Klassiker a regular spectacle. English football's closest equivalent, Liverpool taking on Manchester United, is now merely a battle for the top four. But, on Easter Sunday, Marseille and Paris St Germain played out a game that not only had a huge bearing on the Ligue 1 title race, but also easily lived up to it's billing as Le Classique. Paris St Germain players celebrate their win in the dressing room after the game, after twice coming from behind to beat rivals Marseille . Andre-Pierre Gignac gets up above Marquinhos to power home the opening goal for Marseille after half an hour . Blaise Matuidi is congratulated by his team-mates after bringing PSG level with a superb curling effort from the edge of the box . Gignac fires home his second goal past Salvatore Sirigu after a mistake from Marco Veratti gave him a clear run on goal, to make it 2-1 . Marquinhos jumps for joy after slamming the ball into the roof of the net to make it 2-2 after Zlatan Ibrahimovic's mis-hit free kick . Ibrahimovic put pressure on Jeremy Morel to force an own goal just two minutes later, as PSG went ahead for the first time in the game . Marseille: Mandanda, Romao, Fanni, Morel, Lemina, Dja Djédjé, Mendy, Payet, Thauvin (Ocampos 63 mins), Gignac (Batshuayi 71), Ayew (Alessandrini 72) Subs not used: Aloe, N'Koulou, Samba, Tuiloma . Goals: Gignac 30, 43 . Booked: Romao, Fanni, Ayew, Gignac . PSG: Sirigu, Marquinhos, Thiago Silva, David Luiz (Van der Wiel 34), Maxwell, Verratti, Motta, Matuidi, Pastore (Rabiot 82), Ibrahimovic, Cavani (Lavezzi 59), . Subs not used: Douchez, Cabaye, Bahebeck, Digne . Goals: Matuidi 35 Marquinhos 49, Morel OG 51 . Booked: Veratti, Pastore . In the end it was PSG who ran out winners, but they twice had to come from behind to see off their fierce rivals in a game that had passion, quality, and goals aplenty. The game was decided by a 130-second burst soon after the half-time break, in which the visitors came from 2-1 down to go 3-2 ahead, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic, predictably, involved in both goals, though not perhaps, in the way that would be expected. First the Swedish star slipped as he struck a free kick at goal, only to see his nothing effort land at the feet of Brazilian defender Marquinhos, who slammed the ball into the roof of the net from close range. Just two minutes later Ibrahimovic might have been on hand to tap home Javier Pastore's low cross, but in the end his presence was enough to force defender Jeremy Morel to divert it past his own goalkeeper. It felt harsh on Marseille, who were the better side for large periods, but they were let down by defensive frailties and an inability to really punhish the PSG backline. Despite the hosts dominance of possession, the champions could easily have won this by three or four goals, such were their chances. Ibrahimovic had several excellent opportunities, the last of which saw Steve Mandanda pull off a remarkable save, while Pastore should have scored at least once, and Mandanda also did well to deny Matuidi late on. All of that without considering the chances the visitors missed before falling behind in the first half, with Ibrahimovic denied a penalty following a clumsy tackle by Morel, Pastore firing wide when clean through, and the woefully out of form Edinson Cavani scuffing a volley straight at the keeper after being picked out by a beautiful chipped pass.

Dimitri Payet gets a shot away under pressure from Marco Veratti of PSG in the Stade Veledrome as Marseille looked to take home advantage . On the other hand it is difficult to remember Salvatore Sirigu making too many meaningful saves in the second half, although he did acrobatically tip a Gignac header over the bar shortly before the break to deny the striker a hat-trick. With Lyon having briefly gone top of the table by beating Guingamp earlier in the weekend, it was a game both sides really needed to win to keep up their title challenges. The result puts Laurent Blanc's men top of Ligue 1 again, and is a serious dent to Marseille's hopes. It all looked so different at half time, when an Andre-Pierre Gignac double had his side 2-1 up. The local-born hero first rose above Marquinhos at the back post to head past Sirigu on the half-hour, before slotting past the Italian shortly before half time to restore the lead. Both goals had an element of fortune, with Gignac climbing all over his defender to convert Dimitri Payet's cross, and Marco Veratti gifting him possession through on goal for the second, but nonetheless he took both well. In between was the pick of the goals, a stunner from Blaise Matuidi, who cut inside beautifully, before curling in from the edge of the box, via the fingertips of Mandanda and the inside of the post. PSG's win was marred only by an injury to David Luiz, withdrawn in the first half with what looked like a hamstring pull. But a win over their fierce rivals, and the return to the table's summit, will soften that blow. David Luiz is brought down, and the Brazilian defender was forced off soon after with a hamstring injury which looked serious . Marseille took the lead twice in the first half, but on both occasions they were unable to stay ahead for too long . Gignac celebrates his second goal, and the Marseille striker was only denied his hat-trick by an acrobatic save from Sirigu . Ibrahimovic looks on unimpressed during a difficult first half for the French champions, but his side kept responding to going behind .

A nursing assistant stuffed a wet wipe into 96-year-old Phyllis Hadlow's (pictured) mouth to silence the dementia patient's screams . A hospital nursing assistant stuffed a wet wipe into a 96-year-old woman's mouth to stop her screaming. Deborah Roberts, 53, forced the tissue into Phyllis Hadlow's mouth in an attempt to silence her in front of other nursing staff at Kent and Canterbury Hospital. She also poured water over the dementia patient, telling other staff: 'My son said if they do it to you, you can do it to them.' A court heard how Roberts, 53, mistreated Mrs Hadlow when the elderly widow was being treated at the hospital. Roberts was found guilty of one count of ill-treatment or wilful neglect of a person without capacity following a two-day trial - but avoided a prison sentence. Mrs Hadlow, who has since died, needed extensive medical care and would occasionally lash out and shout, Canterbury Magistrates' Court was told. Staff nurse Janet Nelson said she heard screaming coming from her bed and went to investigate, only to see Roberts shove the wet wipe into the elderly woman's mouth. Roberts told her she did it to stop the patient screaming and Mrs Nelson  told her: 'I don't want to see this again.' In a separate incident, Mrs Hadlow threw water at Roberts so she retaliated by filling a plastic cup with water and pouring some on her head. Healthcare assistant Lisa Ross said Roberts told her: 'I have had enough of this. My son said if they do it to you, you can do it to them.' Roger Davies, defending, said Roberts had wrecked a lifelong career and was now unemployable as a nursing assistant. Roberts, who worked at Kent & Canterbury Hospital, also poured water over the elderly widow, telling other staff: 'My son said if they do it to you, you can do it to them.' He said: 'She didn't think about the consequences of her actions. She will be reminded every week of what she has done and the price she has paid.' Roberts, from Deal, Kent was suspended after the incident in October 2013 and then sacked. Julie Pearce, chief nurse and director of quality for East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust, said: 'We are very sorry for the care Mrs Hadlow received whilst in our hospital and for the distress this would have caused to herself and her family. 'As soon as we were made aware of these allegations in October 2013 we suspended Mrs Roberts, referred the incident to the police and subsequently dismissed her following a disciplinary hearing.' Mrs Hadlow's son, Dennis, 71, who was too upset to face sitting through the trial, said: 'We know people with advanced dementia can be difficult to handle but the staff are supposed to be trained. 'I am glad the witnesses who saw what happened had the courage to speak out. 'We were told the sentence was one step below being sent to prison, but it will also have ended her career.' Roberts was given a one-year community order, which includes 120 hours of unpaid work, and was ordered to pay £750 costs.
Every day Sportsmail takes a look at the European papers to see what are the biggest stories creating talking points on the continent. Let's start in Spain, where Marca and AS report that Real Madrid are set to be without Karim Benzema for their Champions League quarter-final second leg clash against rivals Atletico Madrid. The French striker, who has 15 La Liga goals to his name this season, missed Madrid's 3-1 victory against Malaga with a knee injury which he is struggling to recover from. Spanish newspapers  report that Karim Benzema will miss Real Madrid's clash against Atletico on Wednesday . Despite Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti telling reporters, 'Benzema is not available [for Malaga] but we will have him back for the next game,' Marca lead with the headline 'Benzema still doubtful'. The Madrid-based newspaper claim that Ancelotti is 'hesitating' between playing a 4-4-2 or 4-3-3 formation as Gareth Bale and Luka Modric also look likely to miss Wednesday's clash. Marca lead with a similar line as the heap pressure on the Madrid boss by writing, 'Ancelotti searches for a Champions League Madrid without Modric, Bale...and almost surely without Benzema.' Elsewhere is Spain, Mundo Deportivo hail Barcelona coach Luis Enrique for statistically being 'the best coach in history in his first 50 games.'

Shaquille Omar Hallisey (pictured) hit a stranger over the head with a bottle leaving his victim with a fractured skull . A thug who hit a stranger over the head with a bottle leaving his victim with a fractured skull has been jailed for four years. Shaquille Omar Hallisey's attack in Cardiff was described by a judge as 'a savage demonstration of violence in a public place'. The 20-year-old's victim Matthew Leeke, 38, had been out with friends and was making his way home alone when the assault took place. Prosecuting counsel Jeffrey Jones said witnesses described seeing three males behind Mr Leeke in Queen Street. They said the trio were arguing with Mr Leeke. 'They heard one say "Walk away or else you are going to get hurt" and then saw the defendant smashing a bottle over his head. 'He collapsed, hitting his head hard on the pavings and the three ran off.' Mr Leeke told police he remembered someone speaking to him and then people surrounding him trying to help. Cardiff Crown Court heard paramedics treated cuts to the back of his head and his forehead which had to be glued and stapled in hospital. He was taken by ambulance to the University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, and a scan showed a fracture. In a statement, he said he was now anxious to leave his house and was suffering dizziness and headaches. He said his wife and parents had also suffered a great deal of upset over what happened to him in June last year. Judge Philip Richards acknowledged that Hallisey's guilty plea to wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm had been 'brave' but said it had been a long time coming. Hallisey had been due to stand trial before he changed his plea. 'You used a bottle as a weapon to strike another man over the head and he has been profoundly affected by it,' the judge told him. A judge at Cardiff Crown Court (pictured) jailed Hallisey for four years after he admitted to wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm . He also said that Hallisey, of Cardiff, had been the victim of violence himself when younger and now had a good partner who was standing by him. The judge said: 'I hope you resolve never to come before these courts again.' Caroline Rees, for Hallisey, said her client had known prison was inevitable but that he had a supportive family. 'He is normally a kind and gentle young man doing his best to live a good life against what has been a tragic background', she told Cardiff Crown.
Hitting out: Justin Welby said the students killed in Kenya by Islamic militants were 'martyrs' THE Archbishop of Canterbury will today hail the students killed by Islamist militants in Kenya last week as ‘martyrs’, as Church leaders and politicians use Easter to condemn persecution of Christians. Justin Welby will say in his Easter sermon that 148 Christian students slaughtered by Somali gunmen on Thursday were ‘witnesses’ to their faith and suffered ‘cruel deaths’. His comments follow Pope Francis’s denunciation of the ‘senseless’ killings at Garissa University College, in which Christians were singled out and shot. The Pope said in a Good Friday service in Rome that too many were guilty of a ‘complicit silence’ in the face of such attacks. In an overtly religious Easter message, David Cameron says it was ‘truly shocking’ that Christians were still tortured or killed because of their faith in much of the world. Their outspoken comments came as three people were arrested on suspicion of involvement in the attack in the north-east of Kenya, bringing the total number of suspects being held to five. The Kenyan Government said the three, who were trying to cross into Somalia, are associates of Mohamed Mohamud, a former teacher at a Kenyan Madrassa Islamic school, who is believed to have co-ordinated the attack. Meanwhile, a survivor of the killings was found yesterday two days after the massacre. Cynthia Charotich, 19, hid in cupboard and covered herself with clothes, refusing to emerge when classmates came out of hiding at the demand of the Al-Shabaab gunmen. Archbishop Welby will also refer in his sermon in Canterbury Cathedral to other Christians killed in massacres, including in Libya, saying: ‘There have been so many martyrs in the last year.’ 148 Christian studentsat Garissa University College, Kenya, were slaughtered by Somali gunmen on Thursday.

The troubled son of an influential San Diego businessman was arrested last week for allegedly attempting to kidnap a 7-year-old girl from a local elementary school. Jack Henry Doshay, 22, appeared in court for the first time on Friday as he pleaded not guilty to charges of kidnapping, false imprisonment with violence and child cruelty. Noticeably absent from the court room were the suspect's parents, Karen and Glenn Doshay. Glenn Doshay is a minority owner of the San Diego Padres and a former investment manager who focuses on charitable causes with his wife. Scroll down for video . Caught: Jack Henry Doshay, 22 (left), was arrested last week after allegedly attempting to kidnap a 7-year-old girl from a Solana Beach, California elementary school. On the right, the police sketch of the suspect before Doshay was arrested . Frightening: Prosecutors are accusing Doshay, the son of a prominent local businessman, of attempting to kidnap a 7-year-old girl from Skyline elementary school on March 23 (seen above) Doshay's lawyer Paul Pfingst said he told his client's parents not to show up at the hearing since it would be short, and said they are likely to attend court on Thursday when their son has a bond hearing.  He is currently being held without bail at the Vista jail. 'The family is obviously very distressed,' Pfingst said after the arraignment, 'very distressed a young girl had that traumatic experience.' Doshay was arrested on Wednesday, nine days after he allegedly tried to kidnap a 7-year-old girl from Skyline Elementary School in Solana Beach. Officials say the incident happened around 3:30pm, just as classes were letting out for the day. Doshay allegedly grabbed the young girl, who has not been identified, as she was walking from class to after-school care and tried to cover her mouth with packing tape in an attempt to smother her screams. Parent's worst nightmare: Make Paeske is the father of the girl Doshay allegedly tried to kidnap. His daughter was freed when teachers and parents overheard her screaming for help . Censored: When he appeared in court on Friday, reporters were not allowed to take pictures or broadcast Doshay's image. His layer Paul Pfingst pictured on the right . Emotional issues: Doshay was allegedly arrested at a residential facility on Wednesday where he was seeking treatment for depression . But teachers and parents heard the girl's cries for help and found her struggling with Doshay, who in turn fled the scene in a newer model black Ford Flex SUV. Police say Doshay has no connection to the girl, but that his brother lives near the school. Doshay was arrested nine days after the incident, after police released a sketch with his description and got over 150 tips from the public. He was taken into custody at a residential facility where he was receiving treatment for depression. Pfingst said his client has sought inpatient and outpatient treatment for depression on other occasions in the past. At a press conference following Doshay's arrest, the father of the girl he attempted to kidnap spoke out about his family's relief and the daughter who is 'our inspiration' and 'hero'. 'This guy messed with the wrong girl and the wrong community,' father Mike Paeske said. 'San Diego County families can sleep a little better knowing that one less threat is out there on the streets.' When Doshay appeared in court on Friday, reporters were barred from taking his picture or broadcasting his image. If convicted, Doshay faces up to 11 years in prison.
When Clarence David Moore escaped from a North Carolina prison as a 23-year-old inmate, President Richard Nixon occupied the White House, US forces were still fighting in Vietnam and a single ride on the New York City subway cost 30 cents. Moore has been on the run from the law for more than four decades, until Monday afternoon when he called the Franklin County Sheriff's Office in Kentucky and admitted to being a fugitive. Sheriff Pat Melton says Moore, 66, was at the former Polk Youth Institute in Butner, North Carolina, serving a sentence of more than 10 years for larceny when he broke free June 10, 1972. Scroll down for video . Captured: Clarence David Moore, 66, is seen being wheeled from his home in Frankfort, Kentucky, Monday, after he admitted to being a fugitive who escaped from a North Carolina prison in 1972 . Medical necessity: Moore suffers from several medical conditions and cannot walk, but because he has no Social Security card of any form of ID, he has been unable to receive medical treatment . At 4pm Monday, nearly 43 years after Moore’s escape, he finally emerged from the shadows. ‘I need to make this right and get through this,’ Moore was quoted as telling Sheriff Melton. After sheriff's deputies verified Moore's story, he was taken into custody. The 66-year-old, who suffers from several unspecified ailments and apparently cannot walk on his own, was captured by the station WTVQ being wheeled out of his Frankfort home on a gurney and taken to a hospital before being sent to jail. He explained to investigators he has not been able to get medical treatment because he does not have a Social Security card or any other form of identification. According to the sheriff's office, the man’s unexpected decision to give himself up after all these years was motivated by his desire to see a doctor. Now it will be up to prosecutors in North Carolina to decide whether to pursue extradition in Moore's case. Hiding in plain sight: Moore had worked on a ship for many years before moving to Frankfort and settling in a tidy red-brick home with white columns along a tree-lined residential street . According to North Carolina Department of Public Safety prison records obtained by WHAS11, Clarence Moore, who also went by the name David Moore, had been convicted of larceny in July 1967. Moore told deputies in Kentucky that the charge stemmed from the theft of two television sets. He was originally scheduled to be released June 1, 1978. During his time as an outlaw, Moore had worked on a ship for many years before moving to Frankfort and settling in a tidy red-brick home with white columns along a tree-lined residential street. When in 2009 he was involved in a car crash, Moore gave his name as Ronnie Dickinson to protect his true identity. He is now facing a charge of contempt of court in Kentucky for misrepresenting himself to police five years ago. Prison break: Moore, then, 23 years old, took off from a prison formerly known as Polk Youth Institute in Butner in June 1972 .

The Labour candidate in Britain's most marginal seat was last night accused of failing to tell voters that she met Vladimir Putin in Moscow two years ago when a controversial billion-dollar arms deal was signed. Tulip Siddiq, a former aide to Ed Miliband, and who is standing for Labour in Hampstead, was at the Kremlin with her aunt, the hardline leader of Bangladesh who is accused of human rights abuses. A smiling Ms Siddiq was photographed alongside Putin and Sheikh Hasina, the Prime Minister of Bangladesh and Ms Siddiq's mother Rehana. Labour candidate Tulip Siddiq (left) was last night accused of failing to tell voters that she met Vladimir Putin (right) in Moscow two years ago . But the Tories last night accused Ms Siddiq of trying to conceal her extraordinary links to Putin and Sheikh Hasina. They claimed she appears to have gone to great lengths to cover up her trip in January 2013 – just six months before she won a hotly-contested Labour selection contest in Hampstead – and her links with Hasina. The Tories also said she had deleted postings and photographs on her blog which showed how she campaigned to get her aunt re-elected. And they questioned why her 1,200-word official Labour profile made no mention of Putin, the arms deal or being a member of a ruling Bangladeshi dynasty. A Tory official said: 'It seems very odd that Ms Siddiq has appeared to try to conceal the most interesting parts of her political life.' Retiring Labour MP Glenda Jackson won Hampstead with a majority of just 42 in 2010. Last night a Labour spokesman said: 'Tulip is proud of her background and has always been very open about it.' As for the photograph, the spokesman said: 'Tulip was totally separate from any official delegation but was invited to an event with her family.' The Tories last night accused Ms Siddiq of trying to conceal her extraordinary links to Russian President Vladimir Putin (pictured)
A hue of blue inspired by the waters of Hawaii is a prominent feature of the Obama state china service being unveiled by the White House. President Barack Obama is a Hawaii native who returns every Christmas for vacation. Michelle Obama's office says the first lady chose what's being called 'Kailua Blue' to distinguish her family's china from the red, green, blue and yellow used on more recent state services. Scroll down for video . Went bright: Michelle Obama chose a bold, watery blue hue to accent the Obama White House's official china . Pickard, America's oldest fine china company, has been in business since 1893. In that time, their high end offerings have won them an extremely discerning clientele, including: . Air Force One . Camp David . Gracie Mansion . King of Saudia Arabia . South Carolina Governor's Mansion . United Nations . United States Air Force . United States Department of State . Source . 'It's a modern and fresh color not previously seen on state chinas, but Mrs. Obama's main goal was to create a modern service that is completely compatible and interchangeable and usable with all the historic china services,' White House Curator William Allman said during a preview of Tuesday's state dinner. A fluted band of Kailua Blue, framed by a textured gold rim and a simple gold inner line, appears on all pieces of the service, except the dinner and serving plates. The solid white dinner plates are edged in gold; the service plates have a wide gold rim and the presidential coat of arms at the center. The china, which has settings for 320 people, cost approximately $367,000. It was paid for from a private fund that is administered by the White House Historical Association and used to acquire fine and decorative arts for the presidential mansion. The state china service then-first lady Laura Bush unveiled in January 2009 cost $493,000. It was being unveiled Monday during a preview for Tuesday's state dinner for Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. 'If you've seen our state dinners, we really do a lot of mixing and matching — sometimes because we really do not have enough, sometimes because we're trying to create a new modern, different, edgy kind of look,' Mrs. Obama told Architectural Digest last week when she previewed the Obama state china for interior design journalists and bloggers. 'This Kailua Blue is one of those colors that will complement some of the other pieces already in the collection in a way that's elegant, and I think it will be timeless.'

Long process: Three years ago, in the spring of 2012, Pickard China, of Antioch, Illinois, was brought in to consult on the project. The company has made dinnerware for use at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland and aboard Air Force One . The Obama state china service was paid for with money from a private fund that is used to buy fine and decorative arts for the White House and is administered by the White House Historical Association. The cost was not disclosed. There is no requirement for presidents to have a state china service and some, including Gerald Ford and George H.W. Bush, had none. Planning began in the fall of 2011 when Mrs. Obama and family friend and designer Michael Smith began gathering feedback from members of the White House residence staff. Three years ago, in the spring of 2012, Pickard China, of Antioch, Illinois, was brought in to consult on the project. The company has made dinnerware for use at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland and aboard Air Force One. Mrs. Obama wanted the state china service to have modern elements but also be practical, said the White House, which was unveiling it earlier than recent administrations. Each setting includes a first for presidential tableware — an individual tureen that can be used for soup, dessert or 'any other dish that the chefs get creative and decide they would like to serve with a little panache in an individual serving size,' Allman said. Then-first ladies Laura Bush and Hillary Rodham Clinton were not around to use the state china services they introduced just weeks before their husbands left office. Obama has approximately 20 months left in his term, which ends on Jan. 20, 2017.

It's described as the Google-esque HQ of Australia. With a cubby-house meeting room at the top of a beanstalk and a basketball court and pinball machine for some down time - it's where all the creativity and innovative ideas come to light. Inside the HQ of global company Moose Toys, the Cheltenham office in Melbourne comes complete with toy testing rooms, table tennis table, aerobics room, gym and a custom staff lunch room. Staff can scribble their ideas on walls made out of whiteboards while the Employee of the Year gets a gold crown and cape as well as a free holiday of their choice. But there's one catch for their employees - they're not allowed to sit at their desks when they're having lunch as they believe the great ideas don't always come from sitting in front of a computer. The first of its kind: A meeting room located at the top of a beanstalk in the office foyer at Moose Toys HQ . Moose Toys employees Joost Poulus (left) and Kate Zahra putting the table tennis table through its paces . General manager of products Joost Poulus, who has worked at the company for 14 years, said the vibrant and creative space brought out the best ideas from employees. 'We're the Google of Australia and that's how we see ourselves,' Mr Poulus told Daily Mail Australia. 'Our passionate staff are committed to The WOW and they love not just the toys but also the environment and the people they work with - and that's what we're all about.

Manny Pacquiao has a better chance of beating Floyd Mayweather now than he did in 2010, claims his trainer Freddie Roach. The pair came close to agreeing a big-money bout five years ago but it eventually fell through, leaving the boxing world waiting and wondering whether they would ever meet. But after half a decade of speculation, the pair will finally go head-to-head in Las Vegas on May 2 - and Roach believes his man will have the advantage at the MGM Grand. Manny Pacquiao poses with his family and author Nik Vujicic in a photo posted to his Twitter account . Floyd Mayweather continues his training as he prepares to face Pacquiao after years of speculation . Pacquiao's trainer, Freddie Roach, believes his man is ready to beat Mayweather in Las Vegas on May 2 . Asked whether the 2010 or 2015 version of Pacquiao would have a better chance of victory against the unbeaten Mayweather, Roach told boxingscene.com: 'That is an interesting question because there are obviously trade-offs between the two versions of Manny. But I am convinced that the 2015 model is the more formidable fighter for a few reasons. 'Back in 2010, Manny was still growing into a welterweight. His first two welterweight fights were against Oscar De La Hoya in 2008 and Miguel Cotto in 2009 where he only weighed 142 and 144 pounds respectively, and in between he dropped down to 138 to fight Ricky Hatton. 'Floyd has been campaining as a welterweight since 2005 and weighed 150 in his fight against De La Hoya so that might have given Floyd an advantage. I still like Manny's chances in that fight but I think the Manny of today has a lot more in his favour. Pacquiao is better equipped to beat Mayweather now than he was in 2010, according to his trainer Roach . Mayweather is looking to extend his 47-fight unbeaten streak when he meets Pacquiao next month . The pair will go head-to-head in a $300million mega-fight at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas on May 2 . 'In 2010 the two-year age difference between the fighters was not significant to either, but that's not true today. Floyd at 38 is doing things he didn't do in the past. Floyd is a defensive genius but he has always depended on his legs to perform and you can see now that his legs do not have the same spring or fluidness of his earlier years. Mayweather remains the bookmakers' favourite for the $300million mega-fight next month but Roach is adamant that Pacquiao is primed to cause an upset. 'The 2015 version of Manny is more mature, smarter and less reckless than the 2010 version,' said Roach. 'He will be treating the ring like a chess board anticipating Floyd's moves - ready to cut him off and attack every time he creates an opening. 'I have all the confidence in the world that Manny is going to knock Floyd out on May 2.'
A Missouri mother believes her three-year-old daughter with special needs was discriminated against after finding out the child was forced to take off her thick glasses for a school portrait. Abby Lubiewski was born with Hallerman-Streiff, a rare genetic syndrome that resulted in congenital cataracts. She can only perceive light and dark when she's not wearing her specs. 'She has no vision at all without her glasses,' her mother Amanda Lubiewski told Fox 2 Now. When Lubiewski received her daughter Abby's photographs, she immediately saw that her child's smile was strained. Scroll down for video . Abby Lubiewski's mother Amanda was outraged after finding out her three-year-old daughter with special needs was forced to take her thick glasses off for school picture day . When Lubiewski received her daughter Abby's photographs, she immediately saw that her child's smile was strained and said it was because Abby 'couldn't see' 'I knew then that she couldn't see,' she said. 'And I couldn't quite comprehend what would be going through someone's mind to ask her to take those off.' Lubiewski wrote a post on Facebook about how her daughter 'loves her glasses' and 'needs them to function to the best of her ability,' Yahoo! Parenting reported. 'She is a strong, confident girl and deserves to show off every beautiful part of her, including her glasses.' Lubiewski said that when Abby saw her school photo she asked, 'What happened to my glasses?' But the mother was even more concerned knowing that official school portraits are released to the public if a child goes missing. 'This is very unsafe for her,' she told Fox 2 Now. 'Her picture doesn't look like her without glasses.' When Lubiewski found out other children at Abby's school were allowed to wear their glasses for the photographs, she felt her daughter had been discriminated against. Abby was born with Hallerman-Streiff, a rare genetic syndrome that resulted in congenital cataracts. She can only perceive light and dark when she's not wearing her specs and 'has no vision at all without her glasses' Lubiewski was even more concerned knowing that police release official school portraits to the public if a child goes missing. 'This is very unsafe for her,' she said. 'Her picture doesn't look like her without glasses' Lubiewski contacted LifeTouch School Photography on Facebook and told them 'how disrespectful' the family thought it was for the company to treat Abby 'differently than other children in the school'. 'Photographers for school pictures need to be trained on how to capture each unique child,' she wrote on Facebook. 'Even those with disabilities.' Lubiewski said other photographers in the past have been able to work around the glare Abby's thick specs can sometimes cause for the camera. Two pictures of Abby wearing glasses were taken by the photographer, but she wasn't looking at the camera. 'It's not just about getting a cute picture of her,' the mother said. 'It's how she was treated, and how it seems like she was treated differently because there was a part of her that was difficult to photograph.' LifeTouch School Photography has since apologized to the family. 'We should have never had your daughter remove her glasses for the photo,' the company said to the family. 'We do not tolerate discrimination of any kind on our team.' Abby will get another chance to have her school picture free of charge on Monday after LifeTouch offered to re-take it. LifeTouch School Photography has apologized to the family and will re-take Abby's school picture for free .
Anyone who has seen The Lion King will surely agree that it contains one of the most tear-jerking scenes in all of Disney history. And for one little girl, whose crestfallen reaction as she witnessed it for the first time was captured on camera by her father, it proved almost too much to bear. Shot by adoring dad, called Barles Charkley on the site, who is based in Baltimore, Maryland, the video stars his toddler daughter Viktoria, as she comes to terms with the tragedy that is the death of Simba the lion's father, Mufasa. Tear-jerker: Viktoria's crestfallen reaction (pictured) as she witnessed a sad scene from Disney's The Lion King for the first time was captured on camera by her father Barles Charkley . Mr Charkley posted the brief video, which has so far garnered more than four million views, to his Facebook page on Saturday. It's captioned: 'Viktoria watching Lion King for the first time, and Scar just killed Mufasa!' He then urges viewers to 'check out' her reaction. The little girl is seated hunched up on the sofa gazing at the screen, and as the mournful music rolls in - a score composed by Hollywood heavyweight Hans Zimmer - her bottom lip trembles. The tot then appears to brush away a tear as the emotional scene progresses, before gathering her blanket up around her shoulders in speechless despair. 'Are you sad? Mufasa died?' Mr Charkley can be heard inquiring. The fragile toddler shakes her head repeatedly as her eyes fill with tears. 'You want a hug?' he persists, to which his Viktoria nods her head and makes her way dejectedly over to where he is sitting as the footage ends. Waterworks: Viktoria is seated hunched up on the sofa gazing at the screen, and as the mournful music rolls in - a score composed by Hollywood heavyweight Hans Zimmer - her bottom lip trembles . The Lion King was released in 1994 to rave reviews, and won two Oscars. It later became the highest-grossing hand-drawn animated film in history. The scene in question, which sees Mufasa murdered by his evil brother Scar leaving Simba fatherless, is generally considered to be one of Disney's most haunting spectacles. Other top contenders include the scene in 1942 hit Bambi where the deer loses his parents, and one in 1941's Dumbo, where the baby elephant visits his mother in jail.

A woman who ended up getting lost while running a marathon in Raleigh, North Carolina and ended up having to hitch a ride with the cops to get back on course, still won her race some nine minutes ahead of her closest competitor. Heidi Bretscher's troubles began around mile 17 of the Rock N' Roll Raleigh Marathon that took place earlier this month. The 28-year-old runner was so far ahead of the pack it wasn't clear to her which way she was meant to go. Wrong way: Heidi Bretscher, 28, said she was on pace to beat her personal record when she, and the two cyclists who were accompanying her, missed an unmarked turn . Retracing her steps: At mile 19, Bretscher was leading the women's race by about 30 minutes. She found a police officer who gave her a ride back to mile 17 . Somehow, she ended up running entirely off the planned route and around a lake that wasn't even on the course. Despite her unscheduled detour, Ms. Bretscher's was brought back on track by a couple of helpful cops who drove her in their patrol cars back to the point in the race where things became muddled. After working out her timings and distances she still managed to cross the line well ahead of her closest rival. 'I'm a little frustrated,' she told ABC 11 following her victory. 'I ran three miles off course because I didn't know which way to run in the race.' 'Usually when you cross the finish line, you're really excited. I wasn't excited,' she said. 'I was just really nervous that I was going to get in trouble because I didn't stay on course.' No sign: The route changed from the 2014 race leaving several turns unmarked allowing runners to get lost . Off course: Before the mishap, Bretscher said she was on pace to run her best time ever . On form: Race officials said as soon as they learned of Bretscher's confusion, the course was fixed and crew members were alerted . The organizers had hoped that things would be different this time around after changing the course from last year to help ease the traffic and impact on local residents. Competitor Group Inc., the main company responsible for organizing the Rock N' Roll marathons, said that they worked with the city of Raleigh but hadn't realized the confusion it would cause. 'It's just an embarrassing situation on behalf of everyone involved with Rock N' Roll and something that we're working to fix for next year,' Competitor Group's Dan Cruz said. At mile 19, Bretscher was leading the women's race by about 30 minutes. She came unstuck when she arrived near at a split near Lake Johnson. Not knowing whether to turn left or right, she ended up choosing incorrectly. 'I saw Mile 18 while I was on the trail. However, I never saw Mile 19 and eventually it became clear that we were off track,' she said. Course officials didn't seem to have a clear idea over what she should do either. It wasn't until she approached a traffic cop when she was able to find a clear solution who helped get her back on track. But even then things didn't improve because the police officer dropped her back at mile 17 where her problem first began. A second police officer agreed to whisk her to mile 22, just four miles from the finish line. Winner! Despite her detour, Bretscher managed to be the first woman and third runner overall to finish the race with a time of 3:06:59, nearly 10 minutes ahead of the next woman to cross the finish line . Returning runner: Competitor Group Inc. said that Bretscher was the only runner affected by the course, and as a silver lining, they're offering her a second shot at one of their other marathons, free of charge . The whole incident left Ms. Bretscher feeling frustrated because she had been on pace to run her best time ever. 'One of the hardest things for me, actually, was when I was in the car with the second police officer. I heard the male runner winning the race, and I knew I should have been really close to the finish line at that point,' she said. 'So that was really discouraging for me, but I was still so determined to win.' After crossing the finish line her win came under scrutiny but it was calculated that even with the ride from cops, after analyzing her times, she still came in some nine minutes ahead of her closest rival. Bretscher managed to be the first woman and third runner overall to finish the race with a time of 3:06:59. Competitor Group Inc. say Bretscher was the only runner affected by the new course design and have agreed to allow her entry to another of the marathons they run, free of charge. Ms. Bretscher says despite the error which cause her a great deal of frustration at the time, she will likely be back at the race next year under the presumption that course officials will have learned from their mistakes and that everything will far more smoothly.
An owl breeder has come up with a novel idea to help him tell his young fledglings apart - by giving them brightly coloured manicures. Jay Brittain, 63, was worried that the baby owls at Small Breeds Farm Park and Owl Centre, Herefordshire, look so similar at birth that he could end up overfeeding them, which can be fatal for the birds. So he instructed workers at the farm to varnish the claws of each fluffy owlet using nail polish  in their very own 'talon salon'. The first born Tawny owl is given orange talons, the second hatched has theirs painted purple and for the third born, pink. Scroll down for video . Talon salon: An owl breeder has come up with a novel idea to help him tell his young fledglings apart - by giving them brightly coloured manicures . So far, a total of seven cute owlets born to two different mother's have been given the colourful makeovers at the centre in Kington, Herefordshire . The first born Tawny owl gets orange talons, the second hatched has theirs painted purple and for the third born, pink . Alice Pond applies nail paint to a baby tawny owl which hatched on April 8 at Small Breeds Farm Park and Owl Centre. Staff use ordinary nail varnish for the job . Staff at the farm park have to feed baby mice to the little owlets within 12 hours of hatching and initially three or four times every day. But after three days their feeds reduce to three times a day and, by two months, they need to eat twice a day . Mr Brittain said: 'It is just normal ladies' nail varnish.  It is as simple as that. It is important to keep accurate records and it is important to not to overfeed any one of the single owls.'So to make sure we can see the ages we do this. They all look very similar' Mr Brittain said: 'It is just normal ladies' nail varnish. It is as simple as that. 'It is important to keep accurate records and it is important to not to overfeed any one of the single owls. 'So to make sure we can see the ages we do this. They all look very similar. 'We paint the nails then we know which ones have been fed and which ones have not. 'It also means that we know exactly which is first born and second born, or hatched rather, and so on. Alice Pond applies  purple nail paint to a baby tawny owl. The fledglings look so similar at birth that he could end up overfeeding them, which can be fatal for the birds . Mr Brittain, who has been breeding owls for 22 years, said the risks of overfeeding can be fatal. He added: 'Owlets need to eat more food the older they get but if you do overfeed them it can be very dangerous.'They could die. The food just sits in the stomach' Jay Brittain applies nail paint to a baby tawny owl which hatched on April 8. The owls talons are simply painted and not filed in any way . 'So each one family member in one clutch is painted a different colour depending on when they were born. 'We have for instance three Tawny owls from one clutch, or family, so we have painted their nails three different colours according to when they were hatched.' Mr Brittain, who has been breeding owls for 22 years, said the risks of overfeeding can be fatal. He added: 'Owlets need to eat more food the older they get but if you do overfeed them it can be very dangerous. 'They could die. The food just sits in the stomach. 'It is a bit like us having a really heavy lunch or dinner. They just lie there and they are not in any way active. Painted nails on a baby tawny owl. The new owls will go to other farm parks, zoos, breeding centres or private collectors when they are old enough . 'It should be a lesson for us all really. Something to remember next time we have a Sunday Lunch.' Staff at the farm park have to feed baby mice to the little owlets within 12 hours of hatching and initially three or four times every day. But after three days their feeds reduce to three times a day and, by two months, they need to eat twice a day. They are fully grown at three-months-old and are able to break up the food themselves. Animal carer Alice Pond said: 'In the wild, owls only live three to five years but in captivity they live a lot longer. 'We have a Tawny owl that is about 20 years old. He was rescued from the Weobley area of the county by Jay and he is still here.' The new owls will go to other farm parks, zoos, breeding centres or private collectors when they are old enough.
The Conservative know that they need to turn large parts of the country blue on May 7. And the Camerons seemed to have taken it rather too literally, with both David and Samantha getting stuck in with blue paint while on the campaign trail. While Mr Cameron was messing about with Boris Johnson in Surbiton, his wife was 200 miles away in West Yorkshire giving a lick of paint to a charity project. Scroll down for video . Samantha Cameron picked up a paintbrush to help at The Growing Zone allotment project, a community project for children and adults with special needs . The Prime Minister's wife was campaigning with Conservative candidate Alec Shelbrooke (centre) in the seat of Elmet and Rothwell . Mrs Cameron has made several solo appearances during the election campaign in key seats, today supporting Tory candidate Alec Shelbrooke in Elmet and Rothwell. She visited the Growing Zone, an allotment garden project for adults and children with special needs in Kippax, West Yorkshire. She was introduced to various activities by June Perkin, who founded the scheme seven years ago after getting disillusioned by aimless families and youngsters she watched in a Leeds shopping centre one afternoon. Mrs Cameron was even persuaded to help paint a wooden plant stand, which is being reconditioned and brought back into use by the volunteers and children. Mrs Cameron was introduced to various activities by June Perkin, who founded the scheme seven years ago after getting disillusioned by aimless families and youngsters she watched in a Leeds shopping centre one afternoon . Mrs Cameron said the best thing about campaigning was 'getting out and about - meeting amazing people like June' 'It's great to be in Yorkshire,' Mrs Cameron said. 'The best thing about a campaign is getting out and about - meeting amazing people like June. 'The Growing Zone is an inspiration. It's been lovely meeting everybody here today and seeing what an amazing job they do changing the lives of so many people with disabilities.' Mrs Cameron made her first appearance of the campaign in Rochester and Strood, which was won in a by-election by Ukip's Mark Reckless after he defected from the Tories last year. She joined her husband on a whistlestop tour of the UK, visiting Scotland, Wales, England and Northern Ireland in a single day, and at the weekend the couple visited a Sikh temple in Gravesend. Mrs Perkin said of Mrs Cameron's visit: 'It was absolutely brill. Using the words the kids here use, it was cool. She had a good look round and she was very, very interested. 'She understood everything we're doing and what we're about. And the kids loved it. Do you see their faces?' After taking nine minutes to complete a puzzle, Boris Johnson and David Cameron were relieved to try their hand at hand painting, which they found much easier . The pair were at the nursery in Surbiton to promote a Tory pledge to double free childcare for working parents of three and four-year-olds to 30 hours a week . Describing her inspiration for the project, Mrs Perkin said she had been sitting on her allotment one night, sipping a gin and tonic and thinking how great the environment was compared with the shopping centre where she had got so angry earlier in the day. She said: 'I just thought that these people here, on the allotment, have got things right. 'There's no point moping, I may as well get on with it. So I just grabbed a spade and here we are now.' She said many of the volunteer helpers are retired people who can do as much or as little as they like on the colourful site. There were 3,000 separate visits by children from a wide area last year, Mrs Perkin said. Meanwhile, at a nursery in Surbiton, Mr Cameron and Mr Johnson were left scratching their heads today as they struggled with a children's jigsaw teaching toddlers about the seasons. As the London Mayor tried to hammer ill-fitting pieces together with his hands, the Prime Minister tried out what could be a new election slogan, telling him: 'If in doubt, wedge it in.' After being put right by a four-year-old who spotted their errors, the pair had more fun finger painting with Tory blue paint.
Britain bucked the trend of Western nations by increasing spending on foreign aid last year while others imposed savage cuts. More than half the members of a group of 28 industrialised nations reduced their aid budget between 2013 and 2014, a report found. Britain's failure to follow suit – thanks to a target imposed by David Cameron – means that its overseas aid spending of 0.7 per cent of national income is double the average level of the other nations in the group known as the Development Assistance Committee. A target set by David Cameron (pictured at a rally this week) has left Britain unable to follow other countries in reducing their aid budget between 2013 and 2014 . Out of every £100 spent by these Western nations on overseas aid, no less than £14 now comes from the UK. Overall across these 28 countries aid budgets fell by 0.5 per cent in real terms, according to the report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Despite this, the UK increased its spend by 1.2 per cent to £11.7billion in 2014. It comes on top of even larger increases in previous years. France slashed its aid budget by 9.2 per cent to £6.2billion, the fourth successive decrease. Japan's was cut by 15.3 per cent to £5.5billion. Australia cut its foreign aid by 7.2 per cent to £2.5billion, while cash-strapped Spain cut its funding by 20.3 per cent to £1.1billion. The UK's aid budget is now nearly double France's and ten times the level in Spain. In total, 15 members of the DAC cut foreign aid, including Belgium, Italy, Norway, Poland and Portugal. Britain was one of 13 countries which increased its budget despite the straitened times. These included Germany, the US and New Zealand. Trade, not aid: Conservative MP Peter Bone . Surprisingly, Greece, which is dependent on bailouts from the EU and the IMF, put up its aid budget by 6.8 per cent. Last night Tory Peter Bone, who is standing for re-election as MP for Wellingborough, said: 'When we have seen cuts at home, people find it very strange that we can give away so many billions of pounds a year, half of which we don't even control who it goes to. 'People are telling me on the doorstep during this campaign that we should cut the amount we spend on overseas aid, and increase opportunities for poorer countries to trade with the EU – trade, not aid, is what we need. What this report shows is that other governments recognise the fact that we have got to look after our own country first, and ensure aid is better targeted.' Britain's aid budget may need to rise by at least £500million in future years, because changes in EU accounting rules make it harder to meet the 0.7 per cent target. The Development Assistance Committee was set up by the OECD which represents richer countries. The OECD report, 2014 Global Outlook on Aid, shows that Britain is one of only five members of the DAC to meet the target of spending 0.7 per cent of national income on aid along with Sweden, Luxembourg, Norway and Denmark. The average OECD member spends just 0.39 per cent. In monetary terms, the UK now has the second highest aid budget in the world behind the US which spends £19.6billion. But that is just 0.19 per cent of its national income. France spends 0.36 per cent, and Germany 0.41 per cent. The 28 DAC members spent a total of £81billion on aid last year – a record figure, but down in real terms. It means the UK's budget of £11.7billion is a seventh of the entire total for the Western world. Max Lawson, of Oxfam, praised Britain and criticised countries which have cut their aid budgets. 'Aid saves lives,' he said. 'What we're seeing is shameful indifference on the part of many of the world's richest nations. 'Their leaders are breaking with impunity the solemn promise they made to help Make Poverty History.'
Magistrates at Rotherham Magistrates Court took just 15 minutes to find Ms Gaynor not guilty . A mother-of-two was locked in a police cells for six hours and put on bail for seven months before being put on trial for chopping back tree branches hanging over her garden. Karen Gaynor appeared at Rotherham Magistrates Court accused of causing criminal damage by pruning the tree, after a complaint was made by her next door neighbour Kay Daye, as part of a long-running boundary dispute. But magistrates took just 15 minutes to find the 53-year-old not guilty, saying that she had acted with good intentions. The court heard how council officials had told Ms Gaynor that she could trim the tree near her home in Rotherham but physically refused to show her how much. However, the prosecution then told of how her pruning of the tree 'went way beyond the lawful excuse' and caused 'unnecessary damage'. Adam Walker, prosecuting, said that any trimming of a tree belonging to someone else could be criminal damage and that Ms Gaynor had lawful excuse, which she had exceeded. He said: 'In July 2014, Alan Hepinstall, a council mediator, visited Ms Gaynor's home. 'Mr Hepinstall told Ms Gaynor she could cut overhanging branches back vertically and in line with the boundary but did not show the defendant what he meant. 'There remains one disputed issue of fact and that's the state of the tree before it was pruned.' Neighbour Mrs Daye then told the court that before the tree had been cut last September, it was in a good condition but after she pruned it, 'it was terrible, all chopped back and dead.' However, Helen Shepherd, mitigating, said the conifer had already been dying in the middle which had created a gap but the top of the tree was healthy. Ms Gaynor confirmed to the court that she had a 90-minute meeting with three council officials at her home last July. She said she asked Mr Hepinstall to demonstrate how to cut the branches as she 'didn't want to get in any trouble.' Her daughter, Hayley, also told the court Mr Hepinstall refused to show them because he 'did not have the time.' Ms Gaynor went voluntarily to Main Street police station in Rotherham following the complaint of criminal damage but said she had been reassured she would not be arrested. She added: 'I didn't have a solicitor with me so I feel I was coaxed in. 'I went into the interview and the police read me my rights. I told them I could not understand what 'rights' meant. 'Then the officer slammed his book shut and said: 'Right, I am now going to arrest you'. 'For all the scandal in Rotherham at the moment to think that the police and council have time, money and resources to waste on such a silly thing as a tree is disgusting.' Mr and Mrs Daye have refused to comment on the case. Michael Quinn, a senior district prosecutor with the Crown Prosecution Service, Yorkshire and Humberside, said the incident followed an acrimonious eight-year long neighbour dispute. Karen Gaynor, next to the hedge that she pruned, that ended up with her being locked in a police cell for six hours, put on bail for seven months and being put on trial for criminal damage . Ms Gaynor's neighbour Michael Daye. A complaint was made about the hedge as part of a long-running boundary dispute . He said: 'The allegation was that the damage to the tree went well beyond pruning and that it had been hacked back to little more than a stump. 'A caution was not available as no admissions to the offending were made and so the police took the decision to charge the suspect. 'We respect the decision of the Magistrates' Court and note that it made no criticism of our case.' Under common law, you can cut back a branch from a tree that overhangs or encroaches on your property. The conifer hedge in this case formed the border between the gardens of Karen Gaynor and her next door neighbours. At dispute was whether she had cut back too much of the hedge. The law allows a householder to carry out limited pruning from their own side. However they are not allowed to trespass on their neighbour’s property or alter the height of trees and hedges. The work must be carried out carefully to avoid damage or cause the tree to be unsafe. The prosecution was brought under a charge of criminal damage. This may have been because prosecutors considered the damage caused to the hedge was intentional and related to a neighbour dispute. Rotherham Council's housing and estate services manager Paul Walsh said the matter of the 'boundary hedge' would normally have been discussed between neighbours but the ongoing dispute made this impossible. He said: 'Ms Gaynor was provided with appropriate advice about what she could reasonably and legitimately do. 'Clear and concise instructions were given and the officers did not leave until they were satisfied that those instructions were understood. Ms Gaynor was also advised to act reasonably.'

The BBC has come under fire for spending thousands of pounds of licence fee payers' money on a guide teaching its staff the correct way to use emojis. The 44-page document was commissioned by executives at the BBC who then hired an agency to research how smiley faces could be used in news stories and on social media. Emoji designers were also told to make graphics for the faces of popular stars such as Gary Lineker and Graham Norton. The BBC spent licence fee payers' money on a 44-page guide on how to use emojis before using a 'sad face' emoticon to describe the death of the world's oldest woman . The 44-page document was commissioned by executives at the BBC who then hired an agency to research how smiley faces could be used in news stories and on social media . Bosses at Radio 1 and Radio 1 Extra were sent the emoticon guide earlier this week, The Sun reported. A source told the newspaper: 'We're used to ridiculous BBC schemes but this is the worst yet. Top brass whinge about budget cuts, then they OK this. It beggars belief.' Emojis, which were first created in Japan, are small digital images used to express an emotion, such as happiness or anger, used by millions of people on social media sites like Facebook and WhatsApp. The corporation used them during an 'Emoji Budget' article following George Osborne's statement last month. The news piece used an emoji of two pint glasses clinking together to show that beer duty had been cut by 1p. The BBC also used a 'sad face' emoji to describe the death of the world's oldest woman, Misao Okawa, 117, from Japan this week. The corporation used the images during an 'Emoji Budget' article, using a picture of pint glasses (right) to show that Chancellor George Osborne had cut beer duty by a penny . Some people commented on the article, posted on BBC News' Facebook page, to criticse the use of the symbol. Walter Lasseigne Parenteau wrote: 'Sad face, BBC? You don't think she had a good run?' Daniel McIntyre-Hoeft said: 'The sad face is a bit inappropriate, don't you think?' Dia Chakravarty from the TaxPayers' Alliance said: 'This would be a fitting April Fool's joke - if we weren't paying for it.' A BBC spokesman said: 'We carry out research to help give our audiences what they want and it's right that we do it.'
The say that imitation is the highest form of flattery, although Floyd Mayweather Jnr's sparring partner Jeremy 'J Flash' Nichols' impersonation of Manny Pacquiao is less than complimentary. The Filipino meets undefeated Mayweather in a $300million mega-fight that has been branded 'the biggest bout in boxing history' at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas on May 2. Mayweather has been sharing regular updates from his training camp across social media with the latest being a YouTube video featuring his sparring partner taking on Pacquiao's role during a mock interview. Floyd Maywether's sparring partner Jeremy Nichols gives a mock interview as Manny Pacquiao . 'J Flash' makes fun of the Filipino's faith, singing and claims his mother uses Voodoo . Mayweather uses a -200C kriotherapy chamber to help his recovery from training . Nichols mimics Pacquiao's Visayan accent while poking fun at the 36-year-old's decision to both write and perform his own entrance song as well as ridiculing the 'Pacman's' religious faith. The young boxer also takes a pop at Pacquiao's mother by claiming her 'voodoo powers' are the secret behind his success - so-called 'Mommy D' was accused of using Voodoo chants from ringside during her son's victory over Tomothy Bradley in April 2014. As a parting shot, Nichols refuses to refer to the fight's date in normal English and repeatedly says it will be staged on 'May two, May two!'. The up and coming boxer has not had a professional fight yet but insists he is ready for the challenge of getting Mayweather in prime shape before the contest.

This opportunity is a blessing, I can't thank him enough for giving me the chance,' he added.
Bolton look to have secured their Sky Bet Championship status after shocking Cardiff to claim a 3-0 triumph in the Welsh capital. Craig Davies bagged a brace after Eidur Gudjohnsen hammered the Trotters in front, with 62-time England international Emile Heskey proving his worth by laying on two assists. Cardiff dominated possession, but were undone far too easily by Neil Lennon's clinical side, who now have a 13-point buffer on those in the relegation zone. Eidur Gudjohnsen, pictured with fellow goalscorer Craig Davies, celebrates after scoring against Cardiff . Craig Davies fired a double to ensure his side claimed all three points at the Cardiff City Stadium . CARDIFF (4-4-2): Marshall; Fabio, Ecuele Manga, Morrison; Malone; Noone, Whittingham, Gunnarsson (Kennedy 66mins), Ralls; Revell (Mason 38), Doyle (Harris 78) Subs not used: Peltier, Adeyemi, O'Keefe, Moore . BOLTON (5-3-2): Bogdan; Janko (Feeney 66), Mills, Dervite, Ream, Walker (Moxey 55); Vela, Gudjohnsen (Danns 74), Bannan; Davies, Heskey . Subs not used: Trotter, Rochinha, Lonergan, McCarthy . Goals: Gudjohnsen 55, Davies 59, 73 . Booked: Vela . Referee: Keith Stroud . Attendance: 20,219 . An early Heskey chance sparked a spell of Bluebirds dominance that saw Josh Vela booked for a late swipe at Peter Whittingham. The City playmaker soon had a chance of his own after sparking a move that saw Craig Noone find him on the edge of the box, but his low drive flew just wide. Noone cut in from his left flank and fired just wide before the Bluebirds had their best chance to open the scoring. A Whittingham corner landed at the feet of striker Eoin Doyle, who spun and shot, but he was denied by Barry Bannan on the Bolton line amid cries of handball. Just when the Trotters seemed to be pegged back, they had a chance of their own when Dorian Dervite rose highest to meet Bannan's corner, but Alex Revell was on hand to head away the goalbound effort.

Joe Mason replaced the injured Revell before Gudjohnsen slipped in Davies who curled a clear-cut chance just wide. And they were almost made to pay after Gudjohnsen fouled his Iceland team-mate Aaron Gunnarson on the edge of the box, but Whittingham bent the free-kick inches past the post. The Cardiff City Stadium was shocked into silence in the 55th minute when Gudjohnsen put the below-par Wanderers ahead. Heskey took the sting out of a strong pass with his chest to set up the former Chelsea and Barcelona man inside the 18-yard box, and he lashed a left-footed strike into the top corner. And it was 2-0 less than five minutes later, with Heskey providing the scoring pass once more. His assist found Davies charging down the left wing, and the striker powered into the box and cracked a low shot through the legs of Marshall and into the bottom corner. Cardiff fans streamed out of the stands when Davies put the contest well and truly to bed in the 73rd minute. He bagged his brace by once again darting off his left flank and past Fabio before he bent the ball around the Marshall into the same corner he had scored in 14 minutes earlier. And Davies could have got a hat-trick soon after when he broke clear of the Cardiff defence, but Marshall denied him with his legs.

The feel-good factor at Everton continued to grow after many of the club's first-team players attended the annual 'Academy Day' at Finch Farm on Tuesday. A spring resurgence of five wins and a draw in their last six games has propelled Roberto Martinez's side into the top half of the Premier League,  and the likes of Leon Osman, Phil Jagielka, Ross Barkley and Romelu Lukaku were all present to pass on advice to the next generation of talent. Players from the under-6 to under-11 age groups joined the Blues' senior stars for a training session  at the Halewood complex, with the fun-filled occasion including games of head tennis and shooting drills overseen by manager Martinez and his coaching staff.

The Academy graduate said: 'This is my second one as part of the first team but I still remember when I did it as an Academy player. We were training with the likes of Big Dunc [Duncan Ferguson] and Joseph Yobo then but it's been great to see the smiles on a lot of kids' faces today. 'The Club really look after the younger players and Finch Farm is a special place to be. Today has been good fun and I think we've had as much fun as the kids!' Academy Director Tim Devine added: It's a great opportunity for the six to 11-year-olds to interact with the players, It's a great example of the family atmosphere that exists at the club. The manager and his backroom staff are all here, and it's fantastic.' Romelu Lukaku watches on as a youngster celebrates a goal during one of the small-sided games yesterday .

The Wikipedia official who accused Grant Shapps of doctoring his own online biography was exposed yesterday as a former Liberal Democrat member. The Tory party chairman had been accused this week of using an anonymous user ID to delete embarrassing facts about his past and add unflattering details about his political rivals. But yesterday it emerged that the senior Wikipedia administrator who investigated the allegations - following a tip-off from the left-wing Guardian - was a former Lib-Dem member. Richard Symonds, 29, who goes by the online name 'Chase me ladies, I'm the Cavalry', is one of the UK's top administrators for the website. He once described himself as 'Liberal Democrat to the last'. Scroll down for video . Volunteer: Richard Symonds, who joined the Wikipedia project in 2004, says he was not being political . Mr Symonds decided to block a user called 'Contribsx' on Tuesday after concluding the account was probably operated either by Mr Shapps or under his 'clear direction'. Mr Shapps angrily denied the claims, insisting the story was 'untrue from start to finish'. Mr Symonds' decision was also criticised by other Wikipedia activists, who warned that the site should not be used to 'play politics' and referred the case to an internal arbitration committee. One user wrote: 'I don't know if 'Chase me ladies, I'm the Cavalry' did anything wrong but it's just rather obscure, and doing this during the peak campaign time for the UK 2015 elections as some sort of assignment from a journalist seems odd.' Mr Symonds, from Bow, East London, described himself on Twitter as 'Liberal Democrat (to the last)' before deleting his profile yesterday. He joined other party members who signed a letter to The Guardian in January last year calling for Lord Rennard to have the Lib-Dem whip withdrawn over his refusal to apologise for making unwanted advances to female activists. The internet expert, who has served in the Royal Naval Reserve, has been a Wikipedia volunteer since 2004 and became an administrator for the website in 2007. He is also a paid employee of Wikimedia UK, a charity which promotes the volunteer-written encyclopedia. Furious denials: Grant Shapps yesterday continued to deny he was behind the Wikipedia changes . Among his Facebook friends is Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales, who married Tony Blair's former diary secretary Kate Garvey in 2012. He was once featured in a BBC profile that called him 'one of the UK's top Wikipedians' and reported that he spent up to eight hours a day working on the site. Responding to the criticism yesterday, Mr Symonds insisted he was not a Lib-Dem activist and said he would never let his political views interfere with his Wikipedia work. He added: 'I have never considered myself 'active' in any party, although I have been a lapsed member of the Lib Dems on and off, for probably a year in total since 2010.' Mr Symonds toned down his conclusions about Mr Shapps' possible connections to 'Contribsx', revisions to one of his Wikipedia pages show. At first he claimed the Tory chairman ran the account either directly or indirectly, but later he changed this to suggest simply that the account was run by a user called 'Hackneymarsh' who was linked to Mr Shapps' office by The Guardian in 2012. Mr Symonds admitted that Wikipedia's top officials had 'chastised' him for his handling of the case, although he refused to back down yesterday. He said: 'While a link has clearly been drawn between Hackneymarsh and Contribsx, it is impossible to know who was sitting behind the keyboard of Contribsx. 'But given the nature of edits, I suspect that it was Mr Shapps or someone close to him.' The Liberal Democrats used the claims to poke fun at the Tory chairman when the story broke on Tuesday night, and senior figures in the party continued mocking him yesterday. Lib-Dem leader Nick Clegg said he believed the denials but then joked that the person behind the account could have been 'Michael Green', the pseudonym used by Mr Shapps to promote get-rich-quick schemes before he became an MP. A Lib-Dem spokesman said Mr Symonds had 'no connection to Lib Dem HQ'. 'The first time we saw this story was in the Guardian, and the first time we know about him was when we were asked about him this afternoon,' he added. Minister Justine Greening, left, and Tory election supremo Lynton Crosby, right, were among those mentioned in the Wikipedia edits . Mr Shapps yesterday continued to furiously deny he was behind the Wikipedia changes, and Tory cabinet ministers rallied behind him. He said: 'It's categorically untrue. It's absolutely nothing to do with me. It's just ridiculous. It looks like an extreme dirty tricks campaign designed to do anything but talk about policies.' David Cameron came to his defence, insisting the Welwyn Hatfield MP was doing a 'great job'. Wikimedia UK spokesman Stevie Benton said to the best of his knowledge Mr Symonds did not brief the Liberal Democrats about his actions. 'I would be incredibly surprised if he had done and would say it's out of character,' he told the Daily Telegraph. 'I've worked with Richard for three and a half years and his politics have never entered into anything in that time.' The Guardian rejected criticism that its story did not made it plain that it had prompted the Wikipedia inquiry into alleged links between 'Contribsx' and Mr Shapps. A spokeswoman for the paper said: 'The article clearly states that this was a Guardian investigation which brought to light some potential breaches of Wikipedia's own rules, which were then communicated to the site's administrators.' Unite leader Len McCluskey has become embroiled in a claim against his trade union for bullying and sexual harassment. As part of a constructive dismissal claim under investigation by an employment tribunal, former union official Sally Nailard has accused the Unite general secretary of calling her a ‘scab’. The 50-year-old former regional officer based at Heathrow is seeking undisclosed compensation. The case lifts the lid on alleged ‘discrimination, misogyny and bullying’ at the hard-Left union. The chairman of the employment tribunal in Watford, Isabel Manley, described the case as a ‘sad and sorry tale’. More than half of Labour candidates in its 106 target seats are linked to Unite. Mr McCluskey is one of several union officials cited in Miss Nailard’s claim. She resigned from her £47,000 position last August, following an alleged 18-month campaign of bullying and harassment. Her evidence submitted to the tribunal, seen by the Independent, relates to a copy of an interview she gave to Sky News in 1997 after a cabin crew strike which she didn’t take part in. Her evidence states: ‘If I was such a “scab” as Len McCluskey later said, I would have volunteered to operate as crew over the strike.’ The tribunal continues.
Real Madrid star James Rodriguez is set to return to first team action against Granada on Sunday after recovering from a fractured right foot following two months on the sidelines.

Two thieves murdered a pensioner and dumped his body in an abandoned mine then made it look like a cycling accident, a court heard today. Kevin Cooper and Trewen Kevern allegedly beat David Alderson and left him to drown, before using his keys to steal £40,000 from a safe where he also kept a haul of guns. Police originally thought that the 72-year-old victim - a keen cyclist - had died as a result of falling from his bike, because he was dressed in lycra at the time. Killed: David Alderson was found dead in an abandoned copper mine in January last year . But Truro Crown Court heard that Kevern, 22 and Cooper, 34 - two cousins whose relatives were close to Mr Alderson - lured him to a disused mine at Wheal Maid near Carharrack in Devon and killed him in January last year. Prosecutor Martin Meeke QC told the jury: 'David Alderson was beaten about the head, possibly until he was unconscious. His body was dragged to a pond into which he was dumped face down. 'In the pond he drowned. “Whether his head was forced down into the water we cannot be sure. The only survivors were these defendants.”' Trial: Kevin Cooper is accused of murdering Mr Alderson alongside his cousin Trewen Kevern . Cooper and Kevern then went to the victim's flat in Falmouth and used his stolen keys to steal £40,000 in cash which he kept in a safe. Mr Meeke said of Mr Alderson: '”He was a keen cyclist and frequently to be seen around Falmouth on a racing bike. He often wore cycling shoes and leggings even when he was not on his bike. '“He was wearing such an outfit when his body was found in the pond. It was at first thought that he had a cycling accident. '“Cycling was not his only interest. Another interest was guns. He had a collection of guns. All the guns were licensed and were legally held by David Alderson. There were ten of them there.” 'He was a member of the Land’s End Shooting Club and he had a substantial amount of ammunition at his flat –- the guns and ammo were held in two different safes in his flat.' The jury heard that Mr Alderson, who kept the keys to his flat, car and safe on a cord round his neck, was 'not short of cash' and had once withdrawn more than £43,000 in £50 notes from his local bank. He was planning to buy a third safe for 'something highly illegal', believed to be two unlicensed guns, the court was told. Kevern's sister Tammy lived in a flat below Mr Alderson, and grew close to the pensioner before his death, calling him 'granddad', jurors heard. Discovery: Mr Alderson's body was found at the Wheal Maid mine in Cornwall . Mr Alderson gave Tammy a £1,000 gift and changed the terms of his will to leave his estate to her instead of his own estranged children. Mr Meeke said that on the night of his death, Cooper had lured Mr Alderson to the disused copper mine by making him think he was collecting the illegal guns he wanted. After they killed him, Cooper and Kevern made up a cover story about robbing a travellers' site in order to hide the truth from their family, the court heard. Both defendants deny murder. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.
A second cruise has docked in San Diego with a massive outbreak of the noxious norovirus, which causes vomiting and diarrhea. Royal Caribbean's Legend of the Seas reported 135 passengers took ill before it docked Tuesday. Just one day prior, the Celebrity Infinity cruise liner docked in the Southern California city with 106 sick. Both ships are owned by Royal Caribbean. The Legend of the Seas was carrying 1,763 passengers and 747 crew on 15-night cruise from Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Scroll down for video . The Legend of the Seas docked on Tuesday with 135 sick passengers aboard - the second Royal Caribbean ship infected in two days . The Celebrity Infinity, which docked Monday, reported 106 people who had fallen ill with norovirus . Crews immediately got to work scrubbing down and sanitizing both ships. Norovirus can live on surfaces for weeks, meaning other passengers could also be infected . The Celebrity Inifity, which carried 2,117 passengers and 964 crew, sailed the same path from Florida through the Mexican Riviera. One of the passengers on the Legend of the Seas, Brooke Fagan, described a day of horrible gastrointestinal problems aboard the ship. 'I ended up feeling very very sick, very lethargic, very run-down. couldn't really get out of bed. Ended up throwing up and just had major issues all day,' she told KFMB-TV. Fagan believes the virus came from the ship's port of call in Guatemala. She says she fell ill shortly after that stop. The crew aboard the Legend of the Seas quarantined 15 people who fell ill to their staterooms for 48 hours. Norovirus is an extremely contagious virus from contaminated water or food that can live on surfaces for weeks. It causes severe gastrointestinal distress. After both ships docked, crews went to work scrubbing down every inch of the cabins and common rooms. The CDC, which is investigating the matter, said: 'One CDC Vessel Sanitation Program environmental health officer and one epidemiologist have boarded the ship in San Diego, CA on April 13, 2015 to conduct an environmental health assessment and evaluate the outbreak and response activities. Both ships sailed from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, to San Diego for 15-night cruises. The Celebrity Infinity is pictured here . 'Specimens have been collected and have been tested by CDC to determine the causative agent for this outbreak is norovirus.' The CDC also sent a crew aboard the Legend of the Seas. In a statement sent to Daily Mail Online, Celebrity Cruises said: 'Those affected by the short-lived illness responded well to over-the-counter medication being administered onboard the ship,' the company said. 'During the sailing, we took a number of steps to prevent the transmission of the illness, including implementing enhanced cleaning procedures and protocols, and using special cleaning products and disinfectants that are proven to kill norovirus to clean throughout the ship. 'Additionally, when Celebrity Infinity arrived to San Diego, California, today, we began an extensive and thorough sanitizing onboard the ship and within the cruise terminal, to help prevent any illness from affecting the subsequent sailing.' The statement continued 'Also, all guests will receive a letter at boarding that asks if they have experienced any gastrointestinal symptoms within the last three days. Similarly, if any guest is uncomfortable taking their cruise, for reasons related to personal health or otherwise, our staff assisted them in rescheduling their sailing for another time.' The Maritime-Executive reported the ship previously experienced gastrointestinal illness outbreaks in 2006 and 2013.

Former Dragons’ Den star Duncan Bannatyne this morning announced he would back Labour at the next election – just a week after backing the Tories. The millionaire businessman said Ed Miliband’s plan to scrap the controversial ‘non-dom’ status had won him over. He tweeted: 'Ed Milliband says he will abolish non-dom status in UK. This gets my vote I never thought any party would have courage to do this.' Scroll down for video . Duncan Bannatyne said Ed Miliband’s plan to scrap the controversial ‘non-dom’ status had won him over . It comes after the hotelier signed a letter from more than 100 business leaders backing the Tories’ economic record. The letter claimed that the 'Conservative-led Government has been good for business' and backed the cut in corporation tax to 20 per cent. Mr Bannatyne’s inclusion on the list was deeply damaging for Labour – having previously been one of the party’s most high profile backers. The TV star helped unveil a 'seaside manifesto' with Gordon Brown before the 2010 general election. But he announced this morning that Mr Miliband’s planned raid on the super-rich – announced this morning – has convinced him to return. Speaking in Coventry this morning, the Labour leader promised that the 200-year-old rule for non-doms, which applies to around 116,000 people, makes Britain an 'offshore tax haven for a few' and can 'no longer be justified'. Former Dragons’ Den star Duncan Bannatyne this morning announced he would back Labour at the next election – just a week after backing the Tories . Speaking in Coventry this morning, Labour leader Ed Miliband claimed the 200-year-old 'non dom' rule makes Britain an 'offshore tax haven for a few' and can 'no longer be justified' The Tories warned the plan could cost Britain 'hundreds of millions of pounds' and stopped short of scrapping the rules, despite Labour's claims. Non-domicile status allows people living and working in Britain to only pay tax on their UK income, but not earnings from overseas. They must prove that they regard a foreign country as their real home. But Mr Miliband said that non-dom tests 'are not very rigorous' and can be granted to people who have a burial plot or property abroad. Mr Miliband said everyone who has made Britain their permanent home should pay full UK tax on all their income and gains. He will pledge to abolish the non-dom status from April 2016. The status, which is unique to the UK having been introduced by William Pitt the Younger in the late 18th century, is used by more than 110,000 wealthy people. Mr Bannatyne was one of the former Prime Minister Gordon Brown's most prominent backers - and was wheeled out ahead of the 2010 election (above) to boost the party's business credentials . Mr Miliband said non-dom status results from a discredited belief that 'anything goes for those at the top and that what is good for the rich is always good for Britain'. He said: 'There are people who live here in Britain like you and me, work here in Britain, are permanently settled here in Britain like you and me, but aren't required to pay taxes like you and me because they take advantage of what has become an increasingly arcane 200-year-old loophole. 'There are now 116,000 non-doms, costing hundreds of millions of pounds to our country – it can no longer be justified, and it makes Britain an offshore tax haven for a few.' Non-dom status is often inherited through the father so can apply to people who were born in Britain. David Cameron - in Cornwall with his wife Samantha last night - has been accused of defending special rules for the rich . They must pay an annual fee, of up to £90,000, to take advantage of the rules, which means it is only of us to the very wealthy. Newspaper reports overnight suggested that non-dom rules would be scrapped by Labour altogether. But today it emerged Labour would allow 'real temporary residents' to take advantage of the rules - with the time limit to be consulted on should they take power in the General Election on May 7. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said it should be around two or three years - not the five suggested in some reports. But it emerged that when he was a Treasury minister in the last Labour government, Mr Balls insisted that 'the majority of non-domiciled individuals who had already left the UK spent no more than five years here'. Chancellor George Osborne said Labour's proposals amounted to 'tinkering around the edges' not an outright ban. 'Either they are going to abolish non-dom status altogether which would cost our country hundreds of millions of pounds in lost tax revenues and lost investment - the reason they did nothing on this during 13 years in office,' Mr Osborne said. 'Or they are just tinkering around the edges and making small adjustments to the rules on how long people can be non-dom. 'This confusion is another reminder of why they can't be trusted with our economy.' The Lib Dems said the number non-dom numbers 'exploded' under the last Labour government and more than doubled while Mr Miliband was an adviser in the Treasury. Mr Balls told BBC Radio 4's Today that circumstances had changed and there was now a large budget deficit to cut. 'People were saying in the middle of the last decade this will lead to people leaving the country. It's not actually turned out to be the case,' he said. 'The abuse is bigger than we thought. These rules are ridiculous, they are unfair, they are being abused, and I think it's time to act. 'These were introduced in the period of the Napoleonic wars to allow people who were earning money in the colonies not to pay tax in the UK. 'That's fine, it's a different world now, a different time, different choices.'
A restaurant boss is facing a lengthy jail sentence after he became the last of a string of men to be convicted of child sex offences against girls in Peterborough. Mohammed Khubaib, originally from Pakistan, befriended girls  and then ‘hooked’ them with alcohol - normally vodka - in an attempt to make them ‘compliant’ to sexual advances. The 43-year-old married businessman, who lived in the city with his wife and children, would pursue his interest ‘away from his home and family’, using his restaurant as a ‘focal point’. Scroll down for video . Convicted: Married businessman Mohammed Khubaib, originally from Pakistan, had a ‘persistent and almost predatory interest’ in teenage girls . Khubaib - who was convicted of the charges against him by a jury at the Old Bailey in five hours - had a ‘persistent and almost predatory interest’ in teenage girls, the trial heard. The father of five groomed vulnerable under-age girls by giving them money, gifts or cigarettes before plying them with alcohol. Following a trial he was found guilty of forcing a 14-year-old girl to perform a sex act on him and nine counts of trafficking for sexual exploitation involving girls aged from 12 to 15 between November 2010 and January 2013. His South African friend Manase Motaung, 32, was cleared of raping a 16-year-old and seven trafficking charges, involving six girls. Khubaib's conviction brings the total number of people to be convicted under Operation Erle to ten, of which five are of Pakistani origin. Khubaib was remanded in custody and warned he faces a long spell behind bars when he is sentenced on May 15. Eatery: Khubaib, who lived in Peterborough with his wife and children, would pursue his interest 'away from his home and family', using his restaurant (above) as a 'focal point' Judge Peter Rook QC told him he had been convicted 'of a very serious offence of a rape on a young girl... having plied her with vodka'. He added: ‘You have also been convicted of no less than nine trafficking offences in relation to under-age girls who you were deliberately plying with vodka so that you could take advantage of them, knowing they craved vodka so you could exploit them sexually. The Cambridgeshire Police investigation codenamed Operation Erle has led to a string of convictions for sex offences against girls in the Peterborough area. ‘You must know the only sentence is a custodial sentence - and a long sentence.’ The jury was deliberating for less than a day before it reached its verdicts. Four previous cases led to nine male defendants being jailed for 59 offences against 15 girls, from Peterborough, with a couple from Lincolnshire and Rutland. Mark Dennis QC, prosecuting, said the girls were vulnerable because of their age, background, circumstances or unsettled schooling and Khubaib pretended to be their ‘friend and helper’. Khubaib, who also ran a lettings agency, would drive girls to flats in his 4x4 and, once there, they would be groomed for sex by being ‘plied with alcohol and entertained by himself and his friends’. Khubaib raped a 14-year-old girl in August 2007 by forcing her to perform oral sex on him after she was given alcohol and then ‘rewarded’ with £5, the court heard. The jury heard details of the trafficking allegations. Khubaib would buy one girl and her friends McDonald's meals and tobacco, as well as giving her small sums of money and a £40 bunch of flowers for her 15th birthday, the court heard. He told the girl he wanted her to be his wife, saying that he would ‘choose her over everyone else’, while he told another 15-year-old she had beautiful eyes, the jury was told. When she rebuffed him, saying he was too old for her, he was said to have replied: ‘Age doesn't matter.’ Khubaib allegedly offered another girl £60, telling her: ‘You make me happy, I'll give you money.’ Two weeks later he allegedly increased the offer to £90. The girl refused. In January 2013, Khubaib picked up two friends - one aged 12 and the other aged 14 - in his seven-seater car and took them to a McDonald's, Mr Dennis said. The girls became uncomfortable when Khubaib got into a row on his phone and slipped away. Later that month, the defendants were arrested at a terrace house in Peterborough, where police found two girls aged 14. Khubaib said in police interviews that his association with all of the girls was innocent and he had not acted in any improper way, denying any sexual contact with the girl he is said to have raped. Motaung also denied wrongdoing by saying he had consensual sex with the rape complainant. Cambridgeshire Police and Peterborough City Council launched a ‘victim-led’ inquiry after identifying a number of young people who might have been at risk of sexual exploitation towards the end of 2012. The joint investigation was proactively initiated in response to the Rotherham and Rochdale child abuse cases. Nine Asian men from Rochdale, Greater Manchester, were jailed for a total of 77 years in May 2012 for raping and abusing up to 47 girls - some as young as 13 - after plying them with alcohol and luring them to takeaways. Two years earlier, in November 2010, five men from Rotherham in South Yorkshire were jailed after being found guilty of grooming girls as young as 12. Separately, a serious case review found last month that up to 373 children may have been targeted for sex by gangs of men in Oxfordshire in the last 16 years. Wendi Ogle-Welbourn from the council said: ‘What was different in Peterborough is that having followed other places like Rotherham and Oxford we knew we must have child sexual exploitation in our city.’ The two defendants, both from Peterborough, denied the charges. Following the verdict, Detective Superintendent Gary Ridgway, of Cambridgeshire Police, said: ‘I'm pleased with the verdicts today because not only does it acknowledge the seriousness of this behaviour but also the courage of the young people who were able to face their abuser in court.’ He added that the investigation was more than two years old, and ‘I do not underestimate the impact on some of the young people involved’. Cambridgeshire Police and Peterborough City Council launched a ‘victim-led’ inquiry after identifying a number of young people who might have been at risk of sexual exploitation towards the end of 2012. The joint investigation was proactively initiated in response to the Rotherham and Rochdale child abuse cases. A police spokesman said: ‘We have made great efforts to safeguard these young people, win their confidence and explore what they told us. 'As a result of the information given to us, we launched a number of investigations. A police investigation formally began in early January 2013.’ A number of the victims were in care at the time and had problems at home and school while the abusers' ethnicity reflected the local demographic - Portuguese and eastern European, as well as Asian/Pakistani men. Khubaib's activities involved girls being befriended and then ‘hooked’ with alcohol in an attempt to make them ‘compliant’ to sexual advances . A mother has spoken of her pride after her teenage daughter ‘kick-started’ the police investigation into Khubaib. The teenager was targeted by him when she was just 14 in Peterborough. She saw him three times, but grew scared when he had an argument over the phone after taking her to McDonald's and decided to tell her parents, who took her to the police. Khubaib, 43, did not touch her - but had a ‘persistent and almost predatory interest’ in teenage girls, the Old Bailey heard. The girl's mother said the youngster found giving evidence at his trial ‘worse than she expected’ after her father broke down in tears when she went into the courtroom. She said: ‘We keep telling her how proud we are. At one point she got very depressed and kept saying "I'm stupid, I'm silly". But we told her that, at the end of the day, she has helped so many girls. ‘Luckily, nothing happened to her and she saw sense before it got any further - but she has helped so many girls and she should feel proud of that. ‘There are many girls out there, even though they don't know her, they are going to be thanking her.’ The woman said that the pressure of taking the matter to police had had a ‘big impact’ on her daughter. She explained that before meeting Khubaib, the girl was an outgoing tomboy who enjoyed being out with her friends and going to school. She said: ‘After she told me and her father what had happened and we had gone to the police, she became a hermit.'
A Queensland man has opened up about a very special friendship between him and his best mate - a crocodile called 'Gregory'. Mick Tabone, 74, who previously owned and ran Johnstone River Crocodile Farm and zoo in far-north Queensland first came across the 5.2 metre croc in 1989. For 20 years the farmer would sit on the enormous creature's back while he chatted to him, and never once felt as though he was in danger. Rangers had already been trying to capture Gregory, who had apparently been killing cattle in Eubenangee Swamp near Mirriwinni, 70 kilometres south of Cairns for years, when they asked for Mr Tabone's help. Mick Tabone and Gregory the crocodile shared a strong bond during their 20 year long friendship . 'He was on the run for a couple of years, he had been a naughty boy and was taking cows,' Mr Tabone told Daily Mail Australia. 'The cattle used to come down there and have a drink and Gregory used to grab them by the nose and drown them,' he said. Mr Tabone then spent the next six months setting up traps for the huge creature, in a last bid to save him after a warrant had been issued to kill the croc. 'They had a trap for a couple of years but he just didn't go in, and after a certain amount of time, you know, there's a limit to the amount of time you can spend on this,' he said. 'They (National Parks) issued a warrant to the farmer to shoot him.' The farmer who owned the property where Gregory was snatching cattle called in the help of Mr Tabone and, helped by some 'freak weather', they were finally able catch the reptile. A heavy rainfall meant the trap which had been set up had moved and turtles had gone in after the bait, which Gregory then followed. Gregory was captured my Mr Tabone in 1989 after he was found stealing a local farmer's cattle . 'Three weeks later, water was down to about ankle-deep and I looked hard in the murky water and I said there's this great big massive animal in there,' Mr Tabone revealed. 'I said I've done the most horrible thing of my life, I've killed this big animal.' However upon closer inspection it appeared Gregory was alive and well, and had been keeping himself alive by coming up for air every few hours. 'Because of his size he was able to push the trap up to get a breath of air and then go back down for three to four hours,' the croc farmer said. After a huge operation which involved 16 men carrying Gregory onto the back of a truck and taking him back to Mr Tabone's farm, the creature was finally settled into what would be his home for the next two decades. The farmer describes the reptile that was his best friend as a 'funny animal', and said Gregory and him shared a special bond. He was named after Greg Cullen, the farmer whose cattle he was stealing. 'That gives me a memory of where I caught him from,' Mr Tabone said. The 5.2 metre croc and his farmer would spend time together every day, and Mr Tabone said he was never frightened or felt he was in danger . 'Greg would brings friends over to have a look at the crocodile named after him.' The crocodile would come when Mr Tabone called him, rushing up out of the water to greet his mate. The farmer would then spend time perched on Gregory's back, chatting to him about what was happening on the farm. 'Every day I was there I always spent time with him, I always sat on him,' Mr Tabone said. These meetings would take place between ten and 20 times a day, often in front of the tourists who came to visit the farm but sometimes just between the two of them. 'Sometimes depending if I had time I would go and sit on him and just hang out and chat to him'. When asked whether what he was doing was dangerous, Mr Tabone disagreed saying he never felt unsafe with Gregory. 'No, if I felt danger I wouldn't be in there. 'I love animals but I love living too,' he joked. Since Mr Tabone had to give up the farm in 2008 after repeated knee problems left him with less mobility than he was used to, the farmer has been back to visit Gregory only once. Mr Tabone previously owned and ran Johnstone River Crocodile Farm and zoo in far-north Queensland . 'I went down after 18 months and went down to Gregory's cage and he was in the water,' he revealed. 'I called him over to the gate and he came over to me and the look on his face was just like "Mick why did you leave me here?"' 'They wouldn't let me go inside and I can see their point because it's not mine any more, I understand,' Mr Tabone said. 'He was a really lovely animal, the only reason I sold out was that I got an infection on my knee.' But Mr Tabone doesn't think he can go back to see Gregory again, who he believes has been moved to another farm. 'I can't go there again,' he said. Mr Tabone instead prefers to remember Gregory as he knew him, happily sitting with his farmer and best friend sitting on his back, having a chat.
A Ukip candidate was forced to apology after he appeared to mock the victims of the Mediterranean refugee crisis – just days after hundreds drowned. Peter Endean, who is standing for Nigel Farage's party in council elections, re-tweeted an image with a caption that said: 'Labour's new floating voters. Coming to a country near you soon'. Around 1,300 people are believed to have drowned in the past two weeks while trying to reach Europe in make-shift boats launched by people smugglers from Libya – with up to 950 perishing off the Italian island of Lampedusa over the weekend alone. Peter Endean has apologised for retweeting a message mocking victims of the Mediterranean refugee crisis . Mr Endean, who is seeking election in Plymouth, Devon, and is also UKIP's communications manager for the city, has apologise and claims he re-tweeted it by mistake. He said: 'I retweeted it by accident. It was not intentional and clearly a mistake. I apologise unreservedly.' Earlier, Ukip's deputy chair Suzanne Evans described the situation as a 'devastating tragedy', but insisted Britain needed to be careful not to 'encourage' fleeing refugees from moving to the UK. She said: 'We all want to welcome people here, but as idealistic as we might want to be - and it's in our nature to want to help everybody - you can't, unfortunately. That's the reality of it.' Asked how many refugees Britain should take, Ms Evans replied: 'We have got to be talking thousands rather than tens of thousands.' EU leaders including David Cameron will meet in Brussels on Thursday to discuss a 10-point plan, drawn up in response to growing crisis. Mr Endean, who is standing for Nigel Farage's party in council elections, re-tweeted the above image with a caption that said: 'Labour's new floating voters. Coming to a country near you soon' Mr Endean apologised and claimed he re-tweeted it by mistake. He wrote: 'I retweeted it by accident. It was not intentional and clearly a mistake. I apologise unreservedly' Brussels wants a military mandate to seize and destroy people-smugglers' boats, backed by increased budgets for Frontex, which manages the borders of the 28-nation bloc. It comes after Mr Miliband this morning launched a furious attack on David Cameron and other EU leaders for leaving refugees to drown by stopping search and rescue missions in the Mediterranean. The Labour leader said it was unacceptable to abandon thousands of immigrants boarding makeshift boats in Africa in the hope of making it to Europe. He also called on the UK to take a 'fare share' of refugees fleeing civil war. Around 1,300 people are believed to have drowned in the past two weeks while trying to reach Europe in make-shift boats launched by people smugglers from Libya – with up to 950 perishing off the Italian island of Lampedusa over the weekend alone . EU leaders including David Cameron will meet in Brussels on Thursday to discuss a 10-point plan, drawn up in response to growing crisis - but Ed Miliband said the response had been inadequate . Mr Miliband's remarks came amid growing alarm over the number of desperate families risking their lives to escape the raging civil wars in the Middle East and North Africa. Speaking in Manchester this morning, Mr Miliband attacked the decision to abandon European rescue missions. He said: 'The original decision was a mistake and it should be reversed.' Mr Miliband said: 'The logic is we are leaving people to die because it is a pull factor. We are better than that. We can't be leaving people to drown.'
South Korea Ambassador Lippert is now wearing a dynamic exoskeletal brace on his hand while he recovers from last month's knife attack. Mark Lippert, 42, suffered deep gashes to his cheek and hand when he was assaulted by knife-wielding nationalist Kim Ki-Jong at a breakfast function in central Seoul last month. The envoy required 80 stitches to the wound on his face and two-and-a-half hours of surgery. Scroll down for video . South Korea Ambassador Lippert is now wearing a dynamic exoskeletal brace on his hand (pictured) while he recovers from last month's knife attack . Mark Lippert, 42, suffered deep gashes to his cheek and hand when he was assaulted by knife-wielding nationalist Kim Ki-Jong at a breakfast function in central Seoul last month. Pictured: Lippert pictured with the brace with his wife and young baby . The brace was created by Seoul’s Severance Hospital and Lippert marveled at how quickly they had constructed it. 'It is an amazing apparatus, one I haven't seen before - so innovative and creative,' he wrote on Facebook. 'It is very comfortable and has made a huge difference in my recovery as I am able to hold things in my hand.

Last week South Korean prosecutors formally charged the man who injured Lippert with attempted murder on Wednesday - despite his denials of any intention to kill. Last week South Korean prosecutors formally charged Kim Ki-Jong with attempted murder . The prosecutors' office in Seoul said Kim, was charged with attempted murder, violence against a foreign envoy and obstruction of duty. Kim, 55, was a known maverick activist who had been handed a two-year suspended sentence in 2010 for hurling a rock at the then Japanese ambassador to Seoul. He has denied any intention to kill Lippert, but the prosecutors office said in a statement that the crime was clearly deliberate. 'There was an intention to murder because (Kim) used a lethal weapon in a pre-meditated crime to attack the ambassador's face and neck repeatedly,' it said. Kim has told investigators the ambassador was the 'symbolic' target of his opposition to annual US-South Korea joint military exercises, which he blames for blocking dialogue with North Korea. The annual drills have long been condemned by Pyongyang as rehearsals for invasion. Kim insisted he had acted alone and not on the orders of Pyongyang, but prosecutors said they were looking into whether he has violated the South's strict National Security Law banning any act seen as aiding North Korea or promoting its ideology. Investigators have ransacked Kim's home as part of an investigation into Kim's possible links with North Korea. Kim had visited the North seven times and once tried to erect a memorial in Seoul to the late North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il after his death in 2011. North Korea has rejected accusations that it may have been behind the attack as a 'vicious' smear campaign by Seoul.

Samantha Fleming was asleep in the Indiana apartment she shared with her boyfriend and newborn daughter when the doorbell rang on April 6. On the other side, police say, was a professionally dressed woman carrying a binder who introduced herself to Fleming's boyfriend as a Department of Child Services worker on a surprise visit. But authorities say the woman, Geraldine R. Jones, never worked for the child-welfare agency and that her visit to Fleming's apartment in Anderson, about 30 miles north of Indianapolis, was part of an elaborate scheme to take the 17-day-old baby and claim the girl as her own. Why Jones targeted Fleming, and why the young mother and her daughter, Serenity, left the apartment with her, were key questions in a mystery police continued trying to unravel Tuesday. Scroll down for video . Elaborate plot: Geraldine Jones, 36, of Gary, Indiana (left), has been charged with murder, kidnapping and criminal confinement over the death of new mom Samantha Fleming, 23 (right) Kidnapped: Investigators say Jones pretended to be a social worker in order to steal Fleming's daughter, Serenity (pictured), and claim the child as her own after faking a pregnancy . Scene: Fleming's body was found by police at the home belonging to Jones in in Gary, Indiana. The body had been doused with bleach, put in a garbage bag that was duct taped and hidden in a plastic bin inside a closet . Anderson Police Sgt. Chad Boynton said Jones, who was hospitalized for depression and suicidal thoughts, had refused to speak with detectives. Chief Deputy Prosecutor Steve Koester said Jones has waived extradition and is expected to be returned to Madison County by April 30. Family members of Jones and Fleming didn't return calls seeking comment this week. But a probable cause affidavit released Tuesday shed light into the young mother's disappearance and painted a picture of a suspect who claimed she was pregnant, had furnished a home nursery with baby furniture and baby clothes and had either hosted or been the recipient of a baby shower. According to the affidavit, Jones, 36, arrived at the apartment Fleming and her boyfriend, Rainey Stanley, shared and identified herself as a child services worker. She told Fleming she needed her to go to Gary for a hearing and said it would look better if she brought Serenity with her. That was the last time, Stanley told police, that he saw Fleming alive. Police say they believe Jones targeted Fleming but haven't indicated why she would have masqueraded as a child services worker or how she would have been familiar with Fleming's family situation. Killed: Police say Fleming, 23, was lured from her home by Jones and brought Serenity with her . Boynton said Fleming had had previous contact with the Department of Child Services, but details weren't available Tuesday. DCS spokesman James Wide declined to comment, citing privacy laws. Anderson Police Detective Scott Sanderson said that when Fleming didn't return, police began trying to track her cellphone to locate her and the baby. The affidavit said several text messages were sent from Fleming's phone to her mother but that the family didn't believe Fleming sent them because she is a poor speller and the text messages had 'perfect spelling'. Gary police found Fleming's wallet in an apartment complex where Jones' sister lived. Sanderson went to Gary to meet with detectives there on Friday and went to Jones' address, where he found a woman who identified herself as Jones' sister holding a baby. The woman told Sanderson that Jones had dropped the baby off at her father's the previous Friday and that another sister had taken Jones to the airport to go to Texas. Police say Jones told family members she was pregnant with twins and that one had died at birth. Investigation: According to reports, a woman called Fleming's mother before she disappeared saying she was with DCS and wanted information . But her sister told police she didn't think the baby belonged to her sister and that she had taken the infant from her father because he is elderly. She said her sister had attempted to commit suicide the day before. She then mentioned an odor in the house, the affidavit states, and asked Sanderson, ''Do you smell the smell in the house? It smells like someone is dead''. Sanderson said he and a Gary police officer traced the smell to a closet, where they found a plastic bin with what appeared to be a body in a garbage bag tied with duct tape. The body, which had been doused in bleach, was identified as that of Fleming. Police counted at least 10 stab wounds, the affidavit says. Police said they are trying to determine a motive but the evidence 'indicates that Jones intended to raise Serenity as her own child.' Madison County prosecutors filed paperwork in Circuit Court charging Jones with murder, kidnapping and criminal confinement in the death.
A violent Jamaican drug dealer who evaded deportation for years before he launched a frenzied hammer and knife attack on a young woman in front of her six-year-old daughter could spend the rest of his life behind bars. Lloyd Byfield, 48, pursued a relationship with 26-year-old Leighann Duffy before he armed himself with a claw hammer and a large red handled kitchen knife and smashed his way into her flat in Walthamstow, east London, on September 1 last year. After pleading guilty to murder, he was sentenced to life with a minimum term of 26-and-a-half years by Judge Nicholas Cooke who told him he may never be released. Monster: Violent drug dealer Lloyd Byfield (left) who evaded deportation for years launched a brutal and frenzied knife and hammer attack on Leighann Duffy, 26, when he burst into her flat in Walthamstow, London . Judge Cooke told Byfield he must have had a 'heart of stone' to have killed Ms Duffy despite the presence of the young girl who was herself attacked when she tried to intervene. During the Old Bailey hearing, Judge Cooke also expressed his 'unhappiness' at the failure of authorities to deport Byfield back to Jamaica when he attacked another woman with a chisel and was jailed for burglary in 2005. He said the murder could have been prevented if he had been sent back to Jamaica then. Byfield came to the UK in 2000 and was granted indefinite leave to remain on June 29, 2004 after getting married to a British woman despite being in another relationship with the mother of his child, Patricia White. Nine days before leave was granted, he stabbed Ms White with a chisel. Two months later, he broke into her husband's home and ransacked it. In March 2005 he was jailed for 30 months after pleading guilty to assault occasioning actual bodily harm and burglary. He was ordered to be deported on May 29, 2007. At the hearing, Judge Cooke said: 'I do not know whether when you were in custody any steps were taken to minimise the risk which was represented to women, particularly those with whom you had a relationship. 'It is on any view essential that when men are sentenced for crimes of domestic violence the underlying risk to women is addressed. If it was, it was not successfully addressed. 'You were to be deported but for reasons which cannot be explained to me that was never actioned with the result you were here and able to kill a woman.' Byfield claimed he was in love with Ms Duffy and that she was sleeping with other men. But Judge Cooke said: 'That is not love. Love is caring and cherishing. This was obsessive, possessive, brutality mirroring a wholly wrong attitude to women. 'This was the pinnacle of domestic violence, a scourge which effects the lives of women and children.' Byfield was arrested days after the knife attack when he stopped a PCSO in Walthamstow High Street (pictured) saying he was wanted by the police. He told the officer 'the devil came into my head' Byfield had previous convictions for dealing cannabis in Jamaica and continued to do so in the UK, the Old Bailey heard. He had been staying with a friend in Hackney in the days leading up to the killing but was thrown out on August 31 last year. Byfield repeatedly tried to contact Leighann Duffy but she did not answer his calls until the next day. Prosecutor Crispin Aylett QC said: 'It seems that Miss Duffy had some sort of relationship with this defendant. 'The defendant appears to have become fixated with Leighann Duffy in the weeks leading up to the murder.' Byfield was captured on CCTV travelling from Hackney to Walthamstow in the early morning of September 1. He appears to have spoken to Miss Duffy several times up until 2.33pm and launched his attack some time before 3pm. He banged 18 times on the front door of the flat and then burst into the victim's living room and stabbed her in the arm and neck. When she begged him to stop, he replied: 'Shut up, I don't love you any more. I hear you are sleeping with other men.' Her six-year-old daughter tried to intervene but was hit on the arm and forced away. Witnesses saw Ms Duffy stagger out of her home bleeding heavily shouting 'help me, help me' as the killer fled the scene. She was taken by London Air Ambulance to University College Hospital but died of her injuries two days later. A post-mortem at Walthamstow Mortuary gave the cause of death as a stab wound to the neck. The six-year-old girl received treatment at the scene for an injury but did not need to go to hospital. The murder weapons were recovered from the scene and Byfield was quickly identified as a suspect, police said. During the Old Bailey (pictured) hearing, Judge Cooke expressed his 'unhappiness' at the failure of authorities to deport Byfield back to Jamaica when he attacked another woman with a chisel in 2005 . He was arrested days later when he stopped a PCSO in Walthamstow High Street saying he was wanted by the police. He told the officer: 'I've done it, I'm not going to fight it. When you love someone, you are not supposed to hurt them but love can make you do stupid things. I think the devil came into my head.' Despite confessing to the officer, he later refused to answer questions. However, forensic evidence at the scene, phone records and witness accounts provided 'overwhelming evidence' of his guilt, police said. Byfield, of no fixed address, showed no reaction as he was led to the cells today. Members of the victim's family shouted 'scumbag' and 'I hope you rot in hell' from the public gallery. Leighann's mother Ann Kerr said in a victim impact statement read out to the court by the prosecutor: 'The day Lloyd Byfield broke into Leighann's house and attacked and murdered her completely ripped an entire family apart and our family will never be the same again. 'Leighann was a joyous woman who loved to laugh. Since Leighann was murdered the whole family has suffered immense depression with terrible recurring nightmares.' Detective Chief Inspector Glen Lloyd, from the Homicide and Major Crime Command, said: 'This was a despicable attack on a woman at home with her young child - a place where she was entitled to feel safe. 'Byfield has shown callous and murderous intent by forcing his way in and then proceeding to inflict fatal injuries on Leighann Duffy in a pre-planned attack. 'Byfield was motivated by jealously as he had previously wished to pursue a relationship with Duffy.'

'It helps brighten the hair and remove yellow unflattering tones that grey hair has a tendency to do.

Manchester City supporters sing a song with the line: 'We're not really here.' It sums up the approach of many of their fanbase – they haven't fully bought into the idea that City could be one of the giants of Europe. Celebrity fan Ricky Hatton wants 'the old City back', while rock-God City lover Noel Gallagher says there is 'apathy' towards the Champions League among the fans. Manuel Pellegrini could be worried about his position at Manchester City after losing against their fierce rivals . (Left to right) Segio Aguero, Yaya Toure and James Milner look dejected as they await kick-off after a goal . Boxer Ricky Hatton, pictured at the Etihad for a press conference in 2008, says he wants 'the old City back' Noel Gallagher says there is 'apathy' towards the Champions League among the City supporters . 5 - Games lost by City in 2015, one more than the whole of 2014. 13 - City's position in the Premier League form table after losing four and winning two of their last six. 4 - The first time since losing 4-3 to United in 2009 that City have conceded four in the league. 9 - City have nine points fewer than they did at this stage last season. 70.8 - City's pass completion rate percentage at Old Trafford was their worst of the season. One of the weirdest things I've been hearing lately is people saying Manuel Pellegrini was the right man at the right time for Manchester City. Their logic is that his calm was needed after the Roberto Mancini reign ended with a fractured dressing room, and an FA Cup final defeat at the hands of Wigan Athletic. Pellegrini is calm but it was the worst kind of short-term thinking which has led to City now clinging on to fourth place. The dressing room calmed down temporarily, but he doesn't have the character or gravitas to galvanise a group of players when the going gets tough. He's punching above his weight at Manchester City. City need to stop pussy-footing around and drag the fans into the modern game. They need to fill up the half-empty glasses of the supporters at the Etihad. Pellegrini's appointment would have suited those fans who resist the charge towards potential greatness. He is not a great manager. Look at his record before he arrived in England. He's done well but there is no evidence of greatness, and no suggestion of greatness to come. Frank Lampard applauds the travelling fans at Old Trafford as he leaves the pitch with goalkeeper Joe Hart . Louis van Gaal shakes hands with his opposite number Pellegrini after the final whistle at Old Trafford . Jose Mourinho? Ronald Koeman? Sean Dyche? Not even close... Louis van Gaal should be crowned manager of the year . Forget Eden Hazard and Michael Carrick... the best player in the Premier League this weekend was Leicester's Jamie Vardy . And so it has proved. The signings Manchester City have made have also smacked of small-time thinking. They don't go for the great players anymore, they're not in that market. Jesus Navas is the perfect example: he is quick and that's it. He missed a great chance at the start of the Manchester derby because his end product is so poor. He cost a relatively cheap £15million, but at 29 years old (he was signed in 2013), you wonder what the logic was behind this purchase. He's not good enough to be a regular in the starting line-up at a club with ambitions of dominating the Champions League and Barclays Premier League. Why weren't City in the market for Cesc Fabregas? Or Diego Costa? How come they didn't sign Angel di Maria? Financial Fair Play is often used as the excuse – it's holding City back apparently. Look at United, look at Chelsea – be cleverer with the spreadsheets and FFP isn't a problem. Aguero and Jesus Navas prepare for a free-kick at Old Trafford as the latter struggles to inspire the side . Navas is not good enough to be a regular in the starting XI at a club with ambitions of dominating Europe . City opted against going in the market for players such as Cesc Fabregas (left) and Angel di Maria . City's failure to make any kind of serious progress in Europe reflects badly on English football, but the fault is with the club. They need to think bigger and drag themselves towards greatness. Make big signings, they will improve the team, and if they arrive, they will motivate the big players already at City. Yaya Toure strikes me as the kind of player who will raise his game significantly if he had Sami Khedira alongside him, rather than Fernando. The big message out of City this season has been how brilliant and shiny their new academy set-up is. And it is truly spectacular – a world-class facility. But they don't have the team to match it and they absolutely don't have the manager. If they choose to lose Pellegrini, then they need to think big next time and go for a manager showing true potential to be great – like Diego Simeone or Jurgen Klopp. Pellegrini has been accused of punching above his weight at Premier League champions City . Diego Simeone (left) or Jurgen Klopp could be potential replacements for the City manager . Carlo Ancelotti is another that fits the bill if he was to leave current club Real Madrid at the end of the season . Two managers at less fashionable clubs, trying to fight with the big boys in their domestic league and in Europe. Or go for greatness itself – Carlo Ancelotti fits the bill, and so does the man we all expected the hierarchy at City to deliver – Pep Guardiola. When Sheik Mansour arrived at Manchester City he declared that he wanted the club to be winning in Europe. They're still not doing that, and it's about time City went to the next level, for their own good, and for the good of English football. It's like they poked their head out of United's shadow for a few seconds and got burned by the sunshine. Think big City, or forever stay small.
Giving away healthy lead is enough to send most managers into a fit of rage. There are many players out there that could vouch for that. On Saturday evening, NAC Breda manager Robert Maaskant let his fists do the talking as his side did just that against FC Dordrecht. After being two goals to the good at the interval thanks to goals from Dutch-Moroccan forward Adnane Tighadouini, relegation battlers NAC seemed to be heading towards three vital points against the team rooted to the bottom of the Eredivisie. NAC Breda manager Robert Maaskant takes out his anger on the substitutes bench on Saturday evening . After his side give up a two-goal lead the 46-year-old smashes through the plastic casing of the dugout . The livid NAC manager then turns to his bench to further express his dissatisfaction . However after the hour mark the home side appeared to crumble, letting the visitors claw themselves back into the game with two goals in as many minutes. Clearly incensed by his side's lack of concentration, Maaskant turned to his bench and threw a devastating right hook to the side of the dugout. The 46-year-old clearly packs a punch because his attack sent his fist clean through the plastic casing, cutting his hand. It goes without saying we wouldn't want to be on the wrong end of a Maaskant rant. It's lucky NAC's wobble didn't occur before they headed into the changing rooms at half time... with all those football boots lying around.
Inter Milan are prepared to offer Yaya Toure a five-year contract to lure him away from Manchester City this summer. Despite the fact Toure turns 32 next month, Roberto Mancini is so desperate to sign the powerful midfielder that he's ready to give the Ivory Coast midfielder a deal that will see him play beyond his 37th birthday. Mancini, who signed Toure for Manchester City in 2010, is working hard behind the scenes to bring Toure to Serie A next season. Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure remains a top target for Serie A giants Inter Milan . Toure, pictured with Vincent Kompany, will be offered a new deal by Manchester City in the summer . Former Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini is keen on bringing Toure to the San Siro . The Italian believes Toure has the capacity to dominate games in Serie A well into his mid-30s, like Juventus midfielder Andrea Pirlo has. The midfielder's representatives are fully aware of Inter's interest and are keeping their options open going into the summer. City want to keep Toure, who currently earns £220,000-per-week, and will offer him a new contract at the end of the season, which will also include the opportunity to take up an ambassadorial role at the club when his playing days are over. But Inter will test City's resolve to keep Toure this summer and hope the prospect of a long-term deal will be enough to persuade the former Barcelona to leave England. The 31-year-old scored a consolation goal in Manchester City's surprise 2-1 defeat by Crystal Palace . Toure walks off the Selhurst Park pitch following his side's Premier League defeat at Selhurst Park .
All hungry Leo wanted was one of his dog biscuits to chew on. Instead the Staffordshire-Boxer cross ended up nearly burning the house down and killing his owner's son. The dog caused a severe fire after managing to switch on the cooker while trying to reach his dog treats. The heat from one of the hob's rings set fire to a child's seat that had been left resting on the electric appliance. Fire starter: Hungry Leo almost burned down his owner's home  as he hunted for his dog treats . The blaze was started after the Staffordshire-Boxer cross was believed to have knocked one of the cooker knobs, switching on the hob . Smoke began to fill the three storey home in Peckham, south-east London, as owner Allen Mosey's son, 21, and his daughter's boyfriend relaxed in upstairs rooms. The pair   managed to flee unharmed with Leo after noticing thick black smoke billowing up the stairs. More than 10 firefighters were needed to extinguish the flames. A search of the house later revealed that the source of fire was the cooker. Firefighters believe that when Leo was hunting for food he knocked one of the cooker's knobs, turning the rings on. The blaze damaged one third of the ground floor of the property and Leo's family have been left surviving on sandwiches. 'You wouldn't think butter would melt in his mouth to look at him,' Mr Mosey, 67, told the Southwark News. 'He's the most docile dog you could think of.' The charred remains of a car seat that had been left on the hob, which caught fire . Leo's owner Allen Mosey examines the damage caused to his home by the fire in Peckham, south-east London . Allen and his wife Jean were out shopping when the blaze started. Mrs Mosey, 47, confessed that she often left things on the cooker when it was switched off. She said that despite Leo almost burning down the  house the family still love him, but he will be locked out of their new kitchen. A London Fire Brigade spokesperson said: 'We're naturally extremely pleased that no one was injured in this fire and while unusual, it's not unheard of for our crews to deal with incidents like this. 'It shows just how important it is to keep pets away from naked flames or cooker controls and to make sure kitchen surfaces and cookers are clear of food and other items that can easily catch fire.'
Most brides spend months searching for the perfect accessories on their big day - but a knee-high cast and NHS-issue crutches aren't exactly on the list. However, Kimberley Donoghue, 28, from Ponthenri near Carmarthen, was forced to hobble down the aisle after breaking her leg and a bone in her foot just four days before her wedding. Wearing the heavy white cast beneath her fairy tale dress, her father wheeled her into church and she sat down to say her vows. Kimberley Donoghue, 28, from South Wales wore her leg in plaster under her dress, and has decided to postpone the official wedding photographs until the plaster is off . Ironically, the accident when she was preparing for the day. She said: 'I was carrying a box of wedding decorations down stairs when I suddenly fell. 'Once I got to the bottom of the stairs I knew straight away it was broken. 'Within an hour I was at the hospital and I was told I had a broken leg and I had fractured a bone in my foot. Kimberley says she'd spent a year planning her big day without any problems, until her leg hitch. 'I knew something had to go wrong,' she said. The 28-year-old was wheeled into church by her dad and had to sit to take her vows, after falling down stairs carrying decorations just four days before the wedding . Kimberley says it was difficult getting down the aisle, but she 'wouldn't change it for the world'. The family are planning another party in the summer to celebrate without her cast . But Kimberley and new husband Calvin, 29, went ahead with tying the knot at their village church. She said: 'It was difficult getting down the aisle as I had quite a big dress and I had the crutches too. 'It was a hard day but it was brilliant. The florists were amazing and blinged up my crutches. 'I wouldn't change it for the world, well, maybe not the broken leg.' She says the family are planning another party in the summer to celebrate without her cast. They've also postponed the official wedding photographs until the plaster is off. Kimberley's aunt Sian Jones said: 'The day was fantastic. We were all so proud of her for being so brave and strong all day. 'It was very emotional when she came up the aisle.'
Fresh testimonies from a small island community in the Maldives has reignited reports that missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 could have crashed  over 5000 kilometres away from the official search led by Australian authorities. Locals from the island of Kudahuvadhoo, located in the southern area of the Dhaalu Atoll in the Maldives, reported witnessing 'a low-flying jumbo jet' on the morning of March 8 last year, when the flight disappeared while travelling from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on board. The reports come as acoustic scientists from Curtin University refuse to rule out the possibility that 'distinctive' data they recorded from the area at the assumed time of the crash may have come from the impact of the aircraft as it hit the Indian Ocean. Locals from the island of Kudahuvadhoo in the Maldives reported witnessing 'a low-flying jumbo jet' on the morning of March 8 last year when MH370 disappeared . Kudahuvadhoo is located in the southern area of the Dhaalu Atoll, in the Maldives, in the Indian Ocean . Despite an exhaustive search that is underway along a 600 square kilometre arc approximately 1800 kilometres southwest of Perth, locals from the island believe they identified red and blue markings, similar to those of the missing plane, on a large passenger jet which flew over the island on the morning of the MH370's disappearance, reported The Weekend Australian. Villagers from the community of 3500 claim that many on the island saw the passenger plane, and were interviewed by police and testified with signed statements to what they witnessed. 'I'm very sure of what I saw on a very clear and bright day, and what I saw was not normal- the plane was very big, and low. I did not know until later that other people saw it too. I don't know if it's the Malaysia plane', said Ahmed Shiyaam, 34, an IT manager. Abdu Rasheed Ibrahim said he saw the plane flying towards him over the water, and did not know at the time that it could be the missing Malaysian Airlines flight. 'I didn't know that a plane was missing. I went straight home and told my wife about it. I told my family, "I saw this strange plane". This is the biggest plane I have ever seen from this island...I have seen pictures of the missing plane- I believe I saw the plane...I strongly felt those people who were searching should come here,' Mr Ibrahim said. The Maldvies National Defence Force released a statement in March last year which denied that there had been any aircrafts in the area at the time of the disappearance, which locals have branded as an attempt to hide the limitations of their radar facilities. A local media outlet reported that witnesses claimed the plane was travelling north to southeast, and that the plane was travelling so low it's doors could be seen. 'I've never seen a jet flying so low over our island before. We've seen seaplanes, but I'm sure that this was not one of those. I could even make out the doors on the plane clearly,' an eyewitness told the website. Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 disappeared while travelling from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on board . The search for the missing plane has been headed up by the Joint Agency Co-ordination Centre . The search has focused on 60,000 square kilometres of deep ocean off the coast of Western Australia . 'It's not just me either, several other residents have reported seeing the exact same thing. Some people got out of their houses to see what was causing the tremendous noise too.' The plane dropped off the civilian radar after its transponder and other equipment were switched off shortly after takeoff from Kuala Lumpur. It was then tracked by Malaysia’s military radar heading towards the Indian Ocean. Over the past year, the search for the missing plane by the Joint Agency Co-ordination Centre, headed by Australia, has focused on 60,000 square kilometres of deep ocean off the coast of Western Australia. The location of the search was primarily calculated by sophisticated satellite technology which recorded 'pings' or 'electronic handshakes' sent between MH370 and a satellite for the final hours of it's journey. The flight made a number of unexplained deviations, and flew for several hours in radio silence after it lost contact with Air Traffic Control while flying between Malaysia and Vietnam. As of early March 40 per cent of the area had been scrutinised, but there have been no sightings of debris on the surface or any clues that the aircraft is lying on the sea bed in region covered so far. 'Based on all available data as well as circumstances ... survivability in the defined area is highly unlikely. It is therefore with the heaviest heart and deepest sorrow that we officially declare Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 an accident,' said Malaysia's civil aviation chief, Azharuddin Abdul Rahman. Malaysia's civil aviation chief, Azharuddin Abdul Rahman declared the crash an accident . Dr Alec Duncan (left) from Curtin University's Centre for Marine Science and Technology began investigating a low-frequency underwater sound signal . The signal was recorded west of Rottnest Island using acoustic recorders (above) at 1:30 am on March 8 . The reports from Kudahuvadhoo follow information released from Curtin University  that a 'clear acoustic signal' was recorded at a time reasonably consistent with the timeline of the plane's disappearance. Dr Alec Duncan and his associates from the university's Centre for Marine Science and Technology began investigating a low-frequency underwater sound signal which was recorded west of Rottnest Island just after 1:30 am UTC on March 8. The Centre, along with United Nations’ Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organisation (CTBTO) and Geoscience Australia were involved in investigating data that might prove helpful to the search, and originally determined that the noise's source was close to the Maldives and Kudahuvadhoo. 'Data from one of the IMOS (Integrated Marine Observing System) recorders showed a clear acoustic signal at a time that was reasonably consistent with other information relating to the disappearance of MH370,' Dr Duncan said in a statement released by Curtin University. An Indian sand artist created a message of prayer for the missing crew and passengers of the flight . Relatives of the missing passengers of flight MH370 visit a temple in China to pray for their family members . Relatives of passengers of the flight are told the news that MH370 plunged into the sea on March 24, 2014 . 'The crash of a large aircraft in the ocean would be a high energy event and expected to generate intense underwater sounds.' Dr Duncan said that the noise may have been due to a geological event, including a small earth tremor, but the timing piqued the interest of his research team. 'It would be more correct to say that our team has identified an approximate possible location for the origin of a noise that is probably of geological origin, but cannot be ruled out as being connected with the loss of MH370,' he told The Weekend Australian. In early March, Malaysia's transport minister, Liow Tiong Lai, said that data will be re-examined and a new plan formulated if the plane is not found by the end of May. It is one year since Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 went missing. Here is a timeline of the main events over the last 12 months. 2014 . 2015 .
David Cameron has admitted Boris Johnson is aiming to be the next Tory leader . David Cameron has admitted Boris Johnson is locked in a behind-the-scenes battle with Theresa May and George Osborne to take over the Tory leadership. The Prime Minister said the London Mayor had 'suddenly realised' after years of mischief making that his main political rivals were those lining themselves up to take over the top job. He said Mr Johnson now understood the pair were no longer in 'competition'. The admission exposes the battle quietly raging behind the scenes over who will take over from Mr Cameron. It comes just weeks after Mr Cameron revealed he would stand down as Prime Minister before 2020 if he wins re-election next month. Mr Cameron said: 'Terms are like shredded wheat : two are wonderful but three might just be too many.' He named three of his senior colleagues - Home Secretary Theresa May, Chancellor George Osborne and London mayor Boris Johnson - as possible replacements as Conservative leader when he stands down. Speaking to his cousin Harry Mount in an interview with the Sunday Times, Mr Cameron also admits that his membership of the infamous Bullingdon Club at Oxford is 'cripplingly embarrassing'. Mr Cameron denied that he and the London Mayor have been political rivals for decades. But he admitted that Mr Johnson had, until recently, seen the PM as his competition. He said: 'He suddenly realised I'm not really his competition. His competition is people who'll have a crack at it after me.' Mr Cameron said he saw his relationship with the London Mayor as 'co-opetition'. He said: 'I wanted him to stand for London mayor. George and I helped persuade him to do that. And he's done it brilliantly. 'A Conservative is running the most successful city on earth, and is winning elections.' Mr Cameron said he remembered the London Mayor at Eton 'because he was so striking'. Boris Johnson has 'suddenly realised' that David Cameron is not his 'competition'. The Prime Minister said: 'His competition is people who'll have a crack at it after me' Chancellor George Osborne, pictured campaigning in Brentford this morning, and the Home Secretary Theresa May were named by the Prime Minister as potential successors . David Cameron's 11-year-old daughter regularly teases him for leaving her in the pub, his wife Samantha has revealed. Nancy jokes that she will write a memoir about her life as the daughter of a PM. Mrs Cameron said: 'She's always, like, 'I'm on Chapter Five of Daddy, How Your Life As Prime Minister's Affected Me. Chapter Two is when you left me in the pub'.' Mr and Mrs Cameron were left 'distraught' after leaving the then 8-year-old in the Plough Inn in Buckinghamshire after a Sunday drink in 2008. The Prime Minister, meanwhile, has told the Sunday Times that the family is kept together by his wife. He said: 'I love her as much today as when I first met her; more. Much more.' Mr Cameron added: 'It's easily the best thing that's happened in my life. I'm very blessed to have her. She is amazing.' He said: 'He was dishevelled. I remember watching him play rugby. He was ferocious. Built like a second row.' The Prime Minister also revealed that he had lost almost half a stone since Christmas after going on 'just a little bit' of a diet. Overall he lost 'two kilos'. Mr Cameron's admission that the London Mayor is lining up a tilt at the Tory leadership comes after Mr Johnson was accused of 'breath-taking cheek' after he set out his vision of 'moral purpose' in business and politics. The London Mayor praised the Coalition for having kept down unemployment and not returning to the dole queues of 1980s Britain. He said the fact that more jobs were being created was 'one of the absolute moral triumphs' of the government. The comments by Mr Johnson, who is standing to be a Tory MP in a west London constituency, were seen as an attempt to position himself as a future party leader. In 2004, Mr Johnson admitted a four-year affair with the journalist Petronella Wyatt while he was married to his second wife Marina, with whom he has four children. Five years later he fathered a child by Helen Macintyre, an unpaid adviser in the London Assembly. Mr Johnson spoke about morality in an interview with the London Evening Standard, saying he believed wealth creation was there to fund public services such as schools and hospitals. He said: 'I think this country was harrowed by the experience of mass unemployment in the early Eighties. 'One of the absolute moral triumphs of this Coalition government has been to get us through the worst recession for 50 years without seeing a return to those levels of unemployment.' But Labour's Stephen Pound, who is fighting to defend a nearby seat, said: 'I'm thinking of a sentence with the words pot, kettle and black in it.' 'It seems that Boris's motto is 'do as I say, not as I do'. It really is breath-taking cheek. He obviously has a different definition of 'moral' to most of my constituents.'
Police are hunting for a man who walked into a house in Los Angeles on Sunday and shot a sleeping eight-year-old boy (above) in the head . Police are hunting for a man who walked into a house in Los Angeles on Sunday night and shot a sleeping eight-year-old boy in the head, leaving him critically injured. The suspect, who is described as Hispanic, medium build and wearing a grey hoodie at the time, apparently had no motive for staging the attack in the 11000 block of Wagner Street in Del Rey. According to the victim's father, the attacker walked in through an unlocked front door around midnight and proceeded to fire shots after a heated conversation. The father then ran into the boy's bedroom to shield him as the gunman followed shooting, authorities said. Ammunition plowed through the wall and the bedroom door, although it was unclear which bullets struck the boy. The lath and plaster of the wall are believed to have slowed the shots. The boy was rushed to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center where he underwent surgery for a head wound. As of Monday, he was listed in critical but stable condition. His great-aunt confirmed to NBC LA that his condition was continuing to improve. 'I know that at some point he did say something. They said he was going to be OK,' she said. No other family members were injured in the incident. The young victim's mother and 17-year-old brother were also reported to be in the bedroom,  while the boy's grandmother was in another room. Apparently the front door and security gate had been left open as the father had been expecting his 20-year-old son to return. Scene of the crime: The suspect, who is described as Hispanic, medium build and wearing a grey hoodie at the time, apparently had no motive for staging the attack in the 11000 block of Wagner Street in Del Rey . Unprovoked: According to the victim's father, the attacker walked in through an unlocked front door around midnight and proceeded to fire shots after a heated conversation . Shootings are rare in the residential neighborhood, police said. Indeed, neighbors told CBS News that the family has lived in the residence for more than a decade with no problem. 'According to the family, they did not recognize the suspect' and there was nothing in the house that indicated drugs or other illegal activity, Los Angeles Police Capt. Nicole Alberca said at a news conference Monday afternoon. The names of the family members have been withheld but a photo of the boy has been released. The image shows him smiling with long, wavy, golden-brown hair down to his shoulders. Although the gunman is believed to have fled on foot, anyone who may have seen a vehicle leaving the area is urged to call Los Angeles Regional Crime Stoppers at (800) 222-TIPS.
New York Mets closer Jenrry Mejia has been suspended for 80 games without pay after testing positive for the banned substance stanozolol, Major League Baseball said on Sunday. 'I know the rules are the rules and I will accept my punishment, but I can honestly say I have no idea how a banned substance ended up in my system,' Mejia said in a statement issued by the players union. 'I have been through a lot in my young career and missed time due to injury. I have worked way too hard to come back and get to where I am, so I would never knowingly put anything in my body that I thought could hold me out further. Jenrry Mejia has been suspended for 80 games without pay after testing positive for a banned substance . 'I'm sorry to the Mets organization, my teammates and the fans, as well as my family.' The 25-year-old right hander, who is on the disabled list with an inflamed elbow, will not be able to play again until at least July and would be ineligible for the playoffs if the team make the post-season, the Mets said on their website. 'It's obviously disappointing,' Mets captain and third baseman David Wright said. 'Not only do you cost yourself 80 games and don't get paid, but you're hurting everyone in here. You're letting down your teammates. 'And that probably means just as much, if not more, than hurting yourself.' The 25-year-old right hander will not be able to play again until at least July .
Police say the parents of a 3-year-old boy have been charged with endangering his welfare after they overdosed on heroin while giving him a bath in New Hampshire.

The child was not hurt. MacDonald told Fox Boston that she saw the parents in the bathroom with the boy but grew suspicious when the three became quiet in the room. She went to check on them, she said, and found the parents passed out on the bathroom floor as the child remained in the tub, seeming oblivious to the situation. MacDonald contacted authorities and removed the 3-year-old from the tub, according to the Boston Globe. Caretaker: The child's grandmother told authorities that she lives with her son, Carter (left), and is the primary caretaker of the three-year-old because of Carter's history with drugs . Twenty-one-year-old Carter and 24-year-old McCassin were taken to a hospital, where they were treated for an apparent heroin overdose. MacDonald told police that she is the child's primary caretaker because of her son's, Carter's, past drug problems. It was the Department of Child and Family Services that issued the warrant for for the two holding that the parents put the child at risk, Manchester police said in a statement. Treated: Twenty-one-year-old Carter and 24-year-old McCassin (photographed) were taken to a hospital, where they were treated for an apparent heroin overdose . Both have been released on personal recognizance bail. McCassin is scheduled to appear in court Tuesday. Carter is scheduled to appear May 22. A message left at a phone number for McCassin was not immediately returned. No phone listing for Carter could be found.
A 16-year-old girl sobbed in court as she faced the parents of three classmates who died after the SUV she was driving crashed last August. Julia Ware, who was 15 at the time of the accident, appeared at Wayne County Court in Honesdale, Pennslyvania, on Wednesday. The families of Shamus Digney, Cullen Keffer and Ryan Lesher  - who were all 15 - watched her admit to five of the 12 counts she was charged with by prosecutors. After the hearing was over, a grieving father branded Ware, of Pleasantville, New York, a murderer. Scroll down for video . Julia Ware (center) accepted responsibility for three homicide by vehicle felony counts in a Pennsylvania court . Shamus Digney (left), Cullen Keffer (center) and Ryan Lesher (right), all 15, were killed during the accident . Lisa Lesher held a picture of her son Ryan as she entered the Wayne County Courthouse on Wednesday . The tenth grader accepted responsibility for three felony counts of homicide by vehicle and  two misdemeanor counts of accident involving death or injury. She struggled with her emotions throughout the proceedings and tried to avoid eye contact. Her father, Michael Ware, is awaiting trial on three counts of involuntary manslaughter, endangering the welfare of children and other charges for allegedly allowing Ware to drive, the Bucks County Courier Times reported. A written statement from Ware claimed the man gave her permission to drive so she could go pick up breakfast, according to the Times-Tribune. No trial date is set for the 53-year-old. Ware will be back in court within a month for the juvenile equivalent of sentencing and there are some who feel she should be treated as an adult. Ware was speeding when she lost control and her SUV rolled over in Paupack Township back in August . The father of one of the dead boys, Ed Lesher, said: 'She knew she was wrong. 'She knew she shouldn't have been driving. She knew she was going fast. 'The boys were telling her to slow down. She didn't slow down. 'She thought it was funny to go faster. She murdered three boys, one of them my son Ryan. 'She should be punished like her father.' The dead boys' loved ones wore shirts that had CRS written on the back in honor of Cullen, Ryan and Shamus . Family and friends of the three dead Council Rock High School South students carried signs and photos . Ware, who is now 16, will be back in court within a month or so for the juvenile equivalent of sentencing . Family and friends of the three dead Council Rock High School South students showed up at court wearing identical shirts and carrying signs and photos in honor of their loved ones. The shirts had CRS written on the back in honor of Cullen, Ryan and Shamus. One sign read: 'Be a parent to your child before being a friend.' Another said: 'Charge Julia Ware as an Adult.' During the crash, which occurred over Labor Day weekend in Paupack Township, two other passengers in Ware's 2001 Chevrolet Suburban were injured, WNEP reported. Police think the unlicensed driver was speeding when she lost control of the SUV. It rolled over several times during the deadly accident. John Stieh, who represented Ware, said: '[The Ware family has] done nothing but express the deepest of sorrows since this happened. 'You saw the torment that girl had today. You saw the upset.' The seven other offenses Ware was originally charged with were dropped after her admissions.
It is perhaps the most iconic ship of all time, but the closest most people will get to the Titanic is a visit to the museum in Belfast, or a viewing of the Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet blockbuster. Not so for those with endless funds. One company is offering the chance to dive 12,500ft below the surface of the sea to explore the ship at the bottom of the Atlantic. The tour takes in sights like the famous grand staircase, the ship's huge anchors and the Marconi Room, from which the world's very first SOS was broadcast. The once-in-a-lifetime privilege is being offered by luxury concierge service, Bluefish, and does not come cheap, setting you back a whopping £41,000 ($60,000). Unique experience: Travel to the depths of the Atlantic Ocean to the wreck of the Titanic with concierge service Bluefish . Haunting: Beams of light illuminate the features of the tragic ship, which sank on April 14, 1912 . A port side forward expansion joint on the boat deck of the bow section of the shipwreck. Travellers will learn about the ship in a series of lectures in addition to the dive . The hefty price may seem like a lot but more than 40 people have so far booked the trip to the Atlantic Ocean depths. Director of Bluefish, Steve Sims said: 'We have sent over 40 people down and they have been housewives to technology billionaires, the Titanic really does capture the minds of a wide crowd. 'Bluefish is known for providing the amazing and rare and the Titanic fits both those criteria. 'More people have been into space than set eyes on the Titanic.' Guests will stay aboard the Akademik Keldysh ship at sea and wait for suitable conditions to see the Titanic up close. The transport to the ocean floor is a MIR I or II submersible which are capable of reaching ocean depths of 20,000 ft (98 per cent of the ocean floor worldwide) and withstanding intense pressure. The submersible is constructed of nickel steel and can hold one pilot and two passengers, providing a personal encounter of the vessel. The unique dive takes 11 or 12 hours in total and once you reach the ocean floor powerful lights let you see the main features of ship. As well as this divers can spot harrowing personal items such as shoes or bags caught between the metal rust, which serve as a poignant reminder of the tragic human loss. The starboard railing near the bow of the Titanic. Expeditions take place in a MIR I or II submersible, which is able to withstand the water pressure 12500ft below the surface . The wreck of the Titanic is situated around 676 kilometres from Newfoundland, almost four kilometres below the surface . Not only does the trip offer a truly unique ocean expedition, but it also offers the chance to learn about the majestic vessel in depth. You will take part in a series of lectures and briefings, revealing latest findings about the 269 metre-long liner. There will also be a ceremony commemorating the tragic events and remembering all those who lost their lives on April 14, 1912. Meals, accommodation and personal video are also included in the somewhat hefty price tag. The RV Keldysh and MIRs have made over 15 expeditions to the site of the wreck and have made over a hundred dives. The unique dive takes 11 or 12 hours in total and once you reach the ocean floor powerful lights let you see the main features of ship . Once-in-a-lifetime opportunity! More people have been to space than have explored the Titanic, and the dives aim to collect data for scientific experiments . The aim of the dives is not just tourism, but also obtaining imagery from the site, data and physical samples from the wreck to further research and be used in ongoing scientific experiments being conducted by worldwide scientists . Since Deep Ocean Expeditions began dives to the wreck in 1998 no artefacts have been removed from the site . However it hasn't been plain sailing for Bluefish trips to see the famous ship. Only eight people took the voyage between 2002 and 2006 and after the recession put a strain on luxury spending. 'The recession hit and everything went to pot,' Simms told CNN Money. After years of fruitless searching by many organisations the wreck of the RMS Titanic was found by Dr Robert Ballard in 1986. Since that time multiple dives have been conducted by some of the world’s five deep diving submersibles, representing France, USA and Russia . Now the service has picked back up and guests can experience the whole package, or opt to have everything apart from the dive to the wreck, for £6,820 ($10,000). The bespoke concierge service offers a range of elaborate services, besides the Titanic expedition. Whether it is racing half a million dollars Mercedes in the Mojave Desert, a Virgin Galactic flight into space, or having a James Bond experience in Monaco with Bond girls and being rescued by American Navy Seals, Simms sees no challenge as impossible for the right clients. The luxury does not come cheap, with membership to the club being £3,414 ($5,000) per annum before you have forked out for any experience. Star-crossed lovers! Many were captivated by the James Cameron film, released in 1997, which saw the affluent Rose (played by Kate Winslet) fall in love with poor Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) on the Titanic's fateful voyage .
Apple offers a range of ways to unlock its devices from PINs to passwords and fingerprints. But you could soon use a selfie to gain access to your apps and messages thanks to Apple's latest patent. The filing details a system of scanning a user's face with the front-facing camera when the handset is moved into a certain position, and automatically unlocking the device if the image matches one on file. The patent (illustrated) was filed by the California-based firm in March 2011 and awarded earlier this week. It details a method of scanning a user's face using the front-facing camera each time the phone is moved into a certain position. If the scanned face matches a previously taken photo, the phone unlocks automatically . The patent was filed by the Californian tech giant in March 2011 and awarded earlier this week. Called 'Locking and unlocking a mobile device using facial recognition', the patent explains that current methods of unlocking a device are 'inconvenient and time consuming'. Apple's patent details a method for automatically unlocking a mobile device using a system comprising of 'capturing an initial image  while the device is locked, monitoring a motion state of the mobile device to determine whether the device is moving or is motionless;  analysing the images to detect a user's face and unlocking the device.' Android Lollipop users already have an almost identical feature known as Trusted face in the Smart Lock menu. It is an extension of Face Unlock that launched on Android Ice Cream Sandwich. Once the screen is enabled and the camera is held in front of the face, the screen automatically unlocks. This relies on the user pressing the power button to enable the screen. By comparison it appears that Apple's proposed system would track the movement of the phone to determine whether it is being used, or is placed flat on a table.

By comparison, it appears that Apple's proposed system would track the movement of the phone to determine whether it is being used, or is placed flat on a table. The screen wouldn't need to be enabled. Instead, once the phone is moved and positioned in front of the face the camera would begin scanning. It will only unlock if the angle of the face matches, or is similar to, the one that was initially taken to avoid the phone unlocking simply when the phone is near a face. As Apple explained: 'In one embodiment, the image is analysed for a facial profile of a human face, without regard to a specific user. Apple's proposed system tracks the movement of the phone to determine whether it is being used, or is placed flat on a table (flow chart shown). The screen wouldn't need to be enabled. Instead, once the phone is moved and positioned in front of the face the camera would begin scanning for a face . Android Lollipop users already have an almost identical feature known as 'Trusted face' (left) in the Smart Lock menu. Once the screen is enabled and the camera is held in front of the face, the screen automatically unlocks. The face icon between the Whatsapp and Chrome logo (right) shows the feature is enabled . 'In this case, the device will only need to determine that a human facial profile is present.' It continued that once an allotted period of time has elapsed and a user's face is not detected in any of the images, the device stays locked. 'In another embodiment, detecting the user's face may also include verifying that the user is an authorised user of the device,' the files continued. 'Trusted face' and Smart Lock are extensions of the Face Unlock feature that was launched on Android Ice Cream Sandwich (pictured). This relies on the user pressing the power button to enable the screen . 'The predetermined facial profile may be determined from an image that was previously captured by the device's camera and stored in a storage of images of authorised users.' Chip maker Qualcomm has unveiled its Sense ID 3D fingerprint scanner - the first biometric sensor using ultrasonic technology. It uses ultrasonic sound waves to capture the ridges, sweat pores and more on the tip of a finger in greater detail than capacitive touch ID sensors seen on the likes of Apple and Samsung devices. This not only makes it more accurate than other sensors, but it will also work even if the user’s hands are wet or have dirt or lotions on it, for example. Phones running Sense ID are expected to launch later this year, but Qualcomm did not reveal to MailOnline which devices or manufacturers it is working with. The patent also suggests this feature could be used by multiple users, in the way that multiple fingerprints can be added to its current Touch ID system. 'In this case, the database of images of authorised users would contain an image for each  user,' it added. 'To match a facial profile in the subsequent image, the device would have to compare the subsequent image to each image in the database. 'Furthermore, each authorised user may have an associated unlocking profile in the database that indicates what functions or applications of the device are enabled when the device is unlocked.' Phone makers are looking for alternative ways to secure devices while making them faster and more convenient to open. For example, Fujitsu recently demonstrated its iris scanning prototype that lets people access phones, apps and online accounts by staring at an infrared sensor. This would work in a similar way to facial recognition, but is more secure and unique to an individual user.

When two complete strangers living just an hour apart in Ireland discovered they looked so alike they could be identical twins this week, the world was shocked. But unlikely as it may seem, Niamh Geaney, 26, and Karen Branigan, 29, aren't the only pair to have found their real-life doppelgängers, either by mistake or after a social media hunt. Now three similar British cases have been revealed; a London-based journalist who found hers in Birmingham, two male university students, also in London, and two retired men in Essex. Scroll down for video . What are the odds? Just last month, retired priest Neil Richardson, 69, (right) moved to Braintree in Essex to be confronted with his doppelgänger, former head teacher John Jemison, 74, (left) Uncanny: Niamh Geaney, a 26-year-old TV presenter from Dublin (left), found her 'twin stranger' last week in Karen Branigan (right), through a social media campaign she launched with friends . Just last month, retired priest Neil Richardson, 69, moved to Braintree and was surprised to greeted with waves and 'hello John' greetings wherever he went. 'John' turned out to be John Jemison, a 74-year-old former head teacher who was well-known to the town, and just so happened to look exactly like Mr Richardson. Upon meeting, the pair, who are both grandfathers-of-four now living just 150 yards apart, also realised that as well as being doppelgängers, they had an awful lot in common. Both had attended the same college, and both became RE teachers and choir singers. The pair finally came face-to-face in March when they coincidentally both boarded the same coach for a Friends of Braintree Museum visit to the Magna Carta exhibition at the British Library. 'It was quite spooky,' said Mr Jemison, adding that they 'hit it off immediately' and are now friends. 'My only worry is the number of people who probably think I've been ignoring them when they've been saying "Hello John" to Neil all this time.' Upon meeting, Mr Richardson (left) and Mr Jemison (right), who are both grandfathers-of-four now living just 150 yards apart, also realised they  had a lot in common in terms of their life stories . Mr Richardson married his wife in 1968 (left) while Mr Jemison also married wife Jenny in the sixties (right) In 2011, Devon-born journalist Sophie Robehmed became fascinated by the idea that there might be someone out there in the world who looked exactly like her. In fact, she was the inspiration behind Miss Geaney's ultimately successful social media search. In much the same way, Ms Robehmed launched her mission to find her doppelgänger by publicising it on Facebook, YouTube, and through blogs around the world. And just like Miss Geaney, it turned out that Ms Robehmed didn't need to look that far. Her closest match turned out to be Birmingham native Lauren Hatcher, who worked in the film industry and shared a mutual friend. Devon-born journalist Sophie Robehmed (right) launched a hunt to find her 'twin stranger' in 2011 and found Birmingham native Lauren Hatcher (left) through a mutual friend . After seeing Ms Hatcher's photo, Miss Robehmed set up a meeting in Covent Garden in London, and the rest is history. And in another accidental result, doppelgängers Jonny Sandgrove and Michael Harris, both based in London, got to know each other at university. As cases of mistaken identity around the campus began to mount up, the pair met, again though mutual acquaintances, and ultimately became firm friends. Doppelgängers Jonny Sandgrove (left) and Michael Harris (right), both based in London, got to know each other at University, after friends kept getting them confused . When Mr Harris married his then-girlfriend Naomi a little while later, several members of his family approached Johnny at the wedding to congratulate him. All this comes after Miss Geaney and Miss Branigan's story blew up across the media yesterday, for being the most twin-like case yet. Miss Geaney, a TV presenter, found Miss Branigan after she teamed up with two friends to launch a project called Twin Strangers. This is the moment that Miss Geaney (right) met her doppleganger Miss Branigan (left) for the first time . 'I was ridiculously nervous about how I would react to meeting someone who looks like me' Miss Geaney (right) said about Miss Branigan (left) The aim of the social media experiment was to see which of the three could find their closest lookalike within 28 days and it attracted submissions to their website TwinStrangers from across the world. Incredibly, Miss Geaney found Miss Branigan in just two weeks - just an hour away. After their first meeting she said: ‘I was ridiculously nervous about how I would react to meeting someone who looks like me. 'For the duration of our encounter I pretty much stared at her. I couldn’t get over her face. ‘And some of the expressions she would pull I would think to myself or say aloud, “Oh my God that’s my face”. I can’t remember the number of times I said “this is so freaky”. It was truly amazing. Uncanny: Miss Geaney, a 26-year-old student from Dublin (left), found her 'twin stranger' in Miss Branigan (right), through a social media campaign she launched with friends . ‘I would say Karen is the shyer of the two of us,’ said Miss Geaney. ‘But then you have to remember this was an even more surreal experience for her than it was for me. I’m the weirdo that contacted Karen and asked her to meet me.’ Miss Branigan, who is currently in between jobs, has five sisters and a brother. Miss Geaney has two sisters and a brother, and both girls agree that none of their siblings look anywhere near as similar to them as they do to one another. Since meeting, Miss Greaney and Miss Branigan - who are both single - say they've been chatting on Facebook 'constantly'. Miss Branigan (right) turned out to be a fellow Ireland native who lived just an hour down the road from Miss Geaney (left), making it easy for the pair to meet in real life and take some eerily twin-like photos together . She added, 'Some of the expressions she would pull I would think to myself or say aloud, "Oh my God that’s my face"' While Miss Geaney appears to have beaten her fellow Twin Strangers participants, 21-year-old Harry and 22-year-old Terence, hands down, the search isn't over until April 27. 'I think I have a two, maybe three at a push who resemble me. But they're definitely not as close a match as Karen to Niamh,' Harry English said. 'I'm trailing further behind,' admits Terence Manzanga. 'Must be a guy thing. They tend to be a bit too shy to participate. Not sure if being originally from sub-Saharan Africa has anything to do with it!' Miss Geaney (right) said she and Miss Branigan (left) got on 'very well' as they both applied make-up before the shoot, swapping beauty tips and marvelling at their similarities (pictured) Friends for life? Since meeting, Miss Geaney (right) and Miss Branigan (left) - who are both single - say they've been chatting on Facebook 'constantly' Feedback: Shocked reactions to  their story have flooded in from far and wide . Challenge: Miss Geaney's (right) fellow Twin Strangers participants, 21-year-old Harry (left) and 22-year-old Terence (centre), are still looking for their doppelgängers, and the search isn't over until April 27 . Miss Geaney, who is still promoting the project across social media with Harry and Terence as interest spreads, says there will be no prize for the winner, just 'pride'. They are inviting others from around the world to join in too now, by adding users' photos to their Facebook album. 'There is a huge human curiosity element to it,' She said. 'Can you imagine how surreal it would be to meet someone who looked exactly like you?'

A King Charles Spaniel suffered three degree burns from a pad used to keep him warm during a scan which vets had heated up in a microwave. Twelve-year-old Alfie underwent a general anaesthetic for an MRI scan at the Animal Health Trust clinic in Newmarket, Suffolk. The pet, who is also completely deaf, had the scan, last month after his owner Lynne Edwards from Huntington in Cambridgeshire, noticed a lump behind his ear. Alfie's owner Lynne Edwards, said she only realised something was wrong with the pet when he started to refuse food and found puss oozing from his back . But when Alfie returned from the clinic she realised something was wrong when he started refusing food and found puss oozing from his back. She then took him to a local vet, where staff clipped his fur and exposed the severe burns in his back. Ms Edwards, 64, then discovered that a pad used to keep her dog warm while he had the scan got too hot after it was heated in a microwave. She said: 'I just don't understand how it could have been taken from the microwave and then put directly onto Alfie without it being noticed how hot it was. King Charles Spaniel Alfie, who suffered three degree burns after vets place a heat pad on his back that had been warmed in a microwave . 'They have told me that they always warm them up in microwave but after what happened they have promised to change their practice. 'I am glad that they’ve now said they will do that but it took nearly a week for them to stop the practice.' Alfie is now on medication while his wounds heal, but could face surgery to remove some of the skin around the burns. Ms Edwards, an interfaith minister, is now calling on all vets to ensure they heat up the pads correctly and monitor them adequately. The Animal Health Trust confirmed their vets are now using an incubator to heat the pads. A spokesman said: 'We pioneered the use of MRI in animals back in the 1990s and since then we have scanned more than 20,000 animals. 'In the last five years, around 3,000 of these patients would have had heat pads to maintain their body temperature. 'To the best of our knowledge, we have never seen anything like this before in any of the AHT’s patients. 'We understand how upsetting this situation must be for Lynne Edwards and her family, and have carried out a full investigation. 'We have reviewed, and are updating, our Standard Operating Procedure for the use of heat pads. 'We are also standardising the way in which all heat pads are heated at the AHT.' Alfie, who is also deaf, is now on medication while his wounds heal, but could face surgery to remove some of the skin around the burns .
The glowing blue letters that once lit the Bronx from above Yankee Stadium failed to find a buyer at an auction at Sotheby's on Wednesday. While the 13 letters were expected to bring in anywhere from $300,000 to $600,000, the only person who raised a paddle - for $260,000 - was a Sotheby's employee trying to jump start the bidding. The current owner of the signage is Yankee Hall of Famer Reggie Jackson, who purchased the 10-feet-tall letters for an undisclosed amount after the stadium saw its final game in 2008. No love: 13 letters that hung over Yankee Stadium were estimated to bring in anywhere from $300,000 to $600,000, but received no bids at a Sotheby's auction Wednesday . The 68-year-old Yankee said he wanted 'a new generation to own and enjoy this icon of the Yankees and of New York City.' The letters had beamed from atop Yankee Stadium near Grand Concourse in the Bronx since 1976, the year before Jackson joined the team. ESPN reports Jackson, who attended the auction, bought the letters 'on a lark.' Jackson joked that once he saw the size of the letters, some of which are also 10-feet-wide, he realized he might have gotten ahead of himself. He promised before the auction that if the letters were bought by a bidder in the United States, he would fly out to see the signage himself at the winner's home. Yankee Stadium: The letters at the stadium, which was built in 1923, were installed in 1976 and taken down in 2008 . In addition to the letters, Sotheby's was auctioning off a New York Mets bullpen car from the late 60s. Despite the Mets memorabilia being estimated at only $20,000 to $30,000, it raked in a winning bid of $112,500 at auction.
Retiring AP McCoy has confirmed he will ride to the final race at Sandown on Saturday if he can secure mounts. There had been speculation that the soon-to-be-crowned 20-time champion jockey would end his career after riding in the AP McCoy Celebration Chase, in which he definitely partners Mr Mole, or the feature Bet365 Gold Cup. But there is now a good chance his final mount as a professional jockey will come in the handicap hurdle run at 5.35. AP McCoy has confirmed he will ride to the final race at Sandown on Saturday if he can secure mounts . McCoy's boss, JP McManus, has Jonjo O'Neill-trained Box Office in the race while O'Neill also has entered Champagne Present. Both would be appropriately named last ever rides for the peerless champion. McCoy told Racemail: 'I will not stop. I will ride anything JP runs and, after that, any rides offered. But it won't be until Friday morning until everything is sorted out.' John Ferguson-trained Aqalim, a winner at Cheltenham last week, looks another prospective mount for McCoy in the Listed Select Hurdle. With top weight On His Own now bound for next week's Punchestown Festival and Paul Nicholls-trained Rocky Creek, the next highest rated, still not certain to run, there remains a chance the weight of O'Neill-trained Lost Legend will rise sufficiently for McCoy to ride him in the Bet365 Gold Cup. McCoy receives a kiss from wife Chanelle McCoy after winning the Ryanair Chase on Uxizandre, . Alternatives are Nicky Henderson's 2013 Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Bobs Worth, confirmed an intended starter along with stablemate and Celebration Chase entry Springter Sacre, yesterday. But their regular rider, broken leg victim Barry Geraghty, still retains hope he may return in time. Sam Twiston-Davies has been confirmed as riding Nicholls-trained Unioniste in the Bet365 Gold Cup. A sell-out crowd is expected on Saturday with 18,000 at Sandown. Only 500 tickets remain for sale. The soon-to-be-crowned 20-time champion jockey is set to retire at Sandown racecourse on Saturday . Sandown are also putting on a free train to Esher for those showing their admittance ticket. It leaves Waterloo at 11.02. Meanwhile, passionate Arsenal fan McCoy has revealed family commitments will keep him away from the top of the table clash between his team and Chelsea on Sunday. But he added: 'I have a kind invitation from the chairman to attend any home game before the end of the season.' McCoy pushes Parlour Games into second during his final trip to Aintree racecourse as a jockey .
A cat has laid a claim to having the loudest purr in the world because she makes noises as loud as a Tube train. 12-year-old Bluey has a growl which is louder than most cats can miaow, and has reached a maximum of 93 decibels - more than the official world record holder. Despite her fearsome sound, Bluey is said to be gentle and loving, and is currently in a rehoming centre in Cambridge looking for a new owner. Scroll down for video . Noisy: Bluey the cat could have the loudest purr in the world, according to staff at a rehoming centre . Claire Thomas, from the Blue Cross charity, said: 'We've never had a cat in our care with a purr as loud as Bluey's. 'We thought it would be fun to see just how loud it is so we recorded it and it reached 93 decibels at its loudest, which is very impressive. 'Though she's surprisingly loud she's a lovely cat and we'd hate for it to stop her being rehomed.' Bluey went to the centre after her elderly owner had to go into care, and staff were shocked when they stroked her and she started growling like a dog. Measurement: The loud cat has been clocked at more than 90 decibels using a sound meter app . Homeless: Bluey is looking for a new owner and is currently living at a centre in Cambridge . Her purr, which is almost four time louder than the average cat, has been keeping other animals awake at night. Mis Thomas added: 'Bluey purrs all the time. She just has to see someone and she starts purring. She purrs when she's playing and she purrs when she's eating. 'We think Bluey is a little deaf but that doesn't stop her enjoying life. She's such a happy, friendly cat and she will make such a loving companion.' The noisy cat is well above the official world record holder Smokey, who was recorded at 67.7 decibels in March 2011, but her purr has not yet been officially certified. Contender: Bluey must now register with Guinness if she is to win the official world record . A spokesman for Guinness World Records said: 'We're intrigued by Bluey's talent and we would welcome an application from his owners so we can look into their claim. 'We would love to hear from them and strongly suggest they make an application for this record via our website.' However, Bluey's new owner may have to take precautions, as scientists say noise levels over 90 decibels can cause hearing loss over a prolonged period.
For one rail passenger it was like being ‘held hostage’. Another compared conditions in her carriage to an oven. Stranded for up to five hours, they endured discomfort, frustration and danger more associated with travel in the Third World. In fact they were among thousands on two commuter trains near Clapham Junction – Britain’s busiest interchange station – during morning rush hour as services descended into chaos. Scroll down for video . Chaotic scenes: Thousands of commuters were stranded on trains for up to five hours after a power failure at Clapham Junction station (pictured) in south-west London . Heat: Sami Dodangeh tweeted a picture of police officers handing out water to passengers in stifling conditions . Fire crews help passengers down from the 7.02am East Grinstead to Victoria service which was stranded for four hours . Firefighters used a ladder to help passengers get to safety after some 1,200 people were stuck on the East Grinstead to Victoria train a quarter of a mile south of Clapham Junction . Waiting game: London Victoria station earlier this evening after a power cut in led to severe delays . Extremely busy: MailOnline reader Junior Imode sent in this picture of queuing at London Bridge station earlier tonight, at the entrance to the Jubilee line on the London Underground . Assistance: Staff were on hand to help passengers facing a difficult journey home from London Victoria . Furious passengers were stuck between stations in South London after a power supply problem led to four lines being closed. On platforms, fights broke out when trains did arrive as passengers pushed their way through the doors. Police boarded the stranded trains to hand out water, and paramedics were on hand in case travellers, including pregnant women, were affected as the crowded carriages became unbearably hot. Passengers were not allowed to leave the trains by themselves due to safety concerns. As the chaos unfolded across the network, there were at least 338 cancellations and 138 part cancellations that either missed stops or terminated before their destination. In all, 321 trains were delayed for a total of more than 600 hours. Some 1,200 people on the 7.02am from East Grinstead to Victoria were evacuated from the train after it was stuck for four hours a quarter of a mile south of Clapham Junction. Firefighters used a ladder to help them down before they were led along the track to safety. British Transport Police started evacuating passengers on the stranded service at 10am and passed water to others trapped on board with no air conditioning. Emergency services: British Transport Police officers began evacuating stranded train passengers to waiting buses at around 10am and water was passed through to others still stuck in sweltering temperatures on board . Aid: Fire officers help a man disembark from the  stranded 7.02am service to London using a makeshift ladder . Helped off: One train carrying more than 1,200 passengers between East Grinstead and Victoria was evacuated . PC James Vernon, 40, was one of the 900 passengers rescued and admitted conditions on board were 'horrendous'. A planned strike by rail workers on Bank Holiday Monday in a dispute over the sacking of a colleague has been called off. Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union on East Coast trains based at Edinburgh's Waverley station were due to walk out for 24 hours. The union said the dispute had been resolved and the sacked employee has reached a 'satisfactory settlement' with the company. He said: 'It was absolutely stifling on board the train, it was horrendous. There was so much mis-information about what was going to happen. 'When they decided we were going to be evacuated, we had to wait for everyone to go down two metal steps and go one person at a time along the railway line.' Around 1,000 passengers on the 6.56am from Brighton, East Sussex – also a Southern Rail service – were stranded for nearly five hours. The train should have reached Victoria at 8.15am, but it was finally towed into Wandsworth Common station just before 1pm. One of its passengers, student Hannah Phillips, 20, from Eastbourne, East Sussex, said: 'I was lucky that I was carrying a bottle of water with me as it was getting very hot on the train. 'This is probably the worst train journey I've experienced.' Walking off: Commuters on board the stranded 7.02am service took photographs of the evacuation process . Stranded: Up to 2,000 commuters were eventually led along tracks onto rail replacement buses today . Another passenger on the held-up Brighton train was Ben Goode. He tweeted: 'This is a shambles.' As the service went into meltdown, with the Gatwick Express unable to run and office workers hours late for work, tempers frayed among passengers on platforms. 'Brighton train on, Brighton train cancelled, on, cancelled etc. Not having fun heading from Lndn. Network rail is a shambles.' - Donna Burtchaell . 'I used to work for a train operator so understand but today was a shambles....' - Chris Scott . 'I see Network Rail are making peoples lives a misery again, stuck on trains outside Clapham for four hours, railway in this country, joke.' - Johnny Wishbone . 'Network rail get us off this train and let us walk to clapham! We've been here nearly 2 hours and taking us to Wandsworth is a joke!' - Katie Glaysher . 'Train 28 minutes late....missed 2 connections but Network Rail don't think that's worthy of any compensation.' -Victoria Slater . One tweeted: ‘Absolute chaos @ #Claphamjunction. Fighting to get on trains, falling down gap between train & platform. It’s dangerous.’ Anna Roberts, a journalist on the Brighton train, reported: ‘It’s been nearly four hours now. Police and paramedics boarded because there is no air conditioning. 'They were bringing water. With the power off, it’s like an oven. Police said it’s too dangerous to walk down the track.’ Another passenger tweeted: ‘I’m being held hostage by @SouthernRailUk. There are hundreds of us packed in sweaty carriages. No demands have been made yet.’ Veterinary student Farid Rahman, 19, who was on the evacuated train, said: ‘After three hours the fire brigade came and everyone was evacuated one by one from one door – so the process was lengthy.’ The cause of the power failure was being investigated last night amid claims by railway staff that it could have been down to work done by Network Rail the night before. A broken third rail – which supplies power from the track to the trains – led to the mayhem by disabling the trains’ ‘shoe’, which conducts the power. The chaos came after Sir Peter Hendy, transport chief for London, said commuter services into the capital were appalling, with ‘Gestapo’ ticket inspectors and ‘Wild West’ conditions. Single file: The problem struck between Wandsworth Common and Clapham Junction in the middle of the morning rush hour. People are pictured being evacuated from one of the trains . Discussion: Hundreds of people took to social media to vent their frustration and Freya Richard posted this picture with the caption: 'How many people does it take to make a decision'
The BBC has apologised and admitted the fell victim to a hoaxer who appeared on the World Service claiming the Star Wars films are anti-women, anti-gay and said Darth Vader listens to rap music. Godfrey Elfwick was recruited via Twitter to appear on the programme World Have Your Say, where producers were preparing an item about the trailer for the new film in the franchise. In particular, the programme were looking for people who had never seen any of the films to watch them and give their assessment. Scroll down for video . Harrison Ford as Han Solo, right and Chewbacca, left, in a trailer for the new Star Wars film, 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens'. However, despite the fact that Mr Elfwick's Twitter bio states that he is a 'demisexual genderqueen Muslim atheist' he was still invited on to the programme. Beforehand he also tweeted: 'I've never actually seen #StarWars but the fact that the bad guy was all black and ate watermelons was unbelievably racist even for the 70's.' And appearing on the show he started off by saying that the old Star Wars films are full of social problems 'rooted in homophobia and casual racial sterotypes'. On talking about C-3PO, who he referred to as C-25 and Princess Leia, he said 'The gold robot - C-25 or whatever he's called - is a camp, neurotic coward. Godfrey Elfwick was recruited to talk on the BBC World Service programme after tweeting about never having seen the films . He later confirmed he would be talking on the programme, where he said the franchise was full of social problems . 'The only main female ends up in a space bikini chained to a horny space slug.' He then turned his attentions to Darth Vader adding: 'The main bad guy - what's he called Dark Raider - is he black, he has a deep voice, he listens to rap music - it's just a really bad racial stereotype.' He finished his assessment by saying that film-makers Disney should make 'strong feminist' films such as The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast, before being cut off by presenter Chloe Tilley. However, a BBC spokeswoman said afterwards: 'On this occasion, the force was not with us. Princess Leia, who was captured by Jabba the Hutt in Return of the Jedi. Mr Elfwick said the film was anti-women . Turning his attentions to Darth Vader, pictured, he said: 'The main bad guy - what's he called Dark Raider - is he black, he has a deep voice, he listens to rap music - it's just a really bad racial stereotype' 'The guest presented himself as a 20-year-old who's never seen Star Wars; and we put him on air under that pretence. 'WHYS producers always do their best to check guests in a live programme that invites global discussion from listeners.' The new Star Wars film, entitled Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens, had its first trailer released last week and will hit cinema screens in December. The one minute 51 second trailer was unveiled by JJ Abrams during a fan even at California's Anaheim Convention Center - with stars Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill, Daisy Ridley, Oscar Isaac and John Boyega looking on. The clip is the first time Han Solo, played by Harrison Ford, has been seen on film since 1983's Return of The Jedi. He is joined by Chewbacca at the end of the trailer and heard saying, 'Chewie, we're home.'
If you were placed in a room with a button and told not to press it, could you fight the temptation? A current Reddit thread is testing its users resolve to do just this by placing a clickable button next to a 60-second timer. When The Button is clicked, the timer resets and it is not yet known what happens when the clock reaches zero because no-one can resist clicking it. More than 730,285 Reddit users have pressed The Button (pictured) since the California firm launched its r/thebutton thread on April Fool's Day. It is not yet known what happens when the timer reaches zero and users can only click The Button once . At the time of writing, more than 730,285 Reddit users have pressed The Button since Reddit launched its r/thebutton thread on April Fool's Day. Only people who registered on the site before this date are eligible to click The Button, and when they do they are awarded a colour, known as a 'flair.' This colour represents the time period at which they clicked The Button, ranging from zero to 60 seconds.

The world's longest ever kidney donation chain linked its final donor to ailing recipient last month when a Wisconsin woman became the 34th person whose life was saved by the record-setting program. Mitzi Neyens, 77, was successfully matched with a Philadelphia man after turning to the National Kidney Registry's paired exchange program--her only option since her age barred her from receiving a deceased donor's organ. When she received the kidney March 26, the operation completed a nationwide chain that linked strangers from San Diego to Boston who have loved ones in need with patients desperately in need of a transplant. 32 lives saved: Mitzi Neyens, 77, (left) was the last link in a chain of 34 kidney transplants--the world's longest such chain to date. She received a kidney because her husband Bill gave his kidney to a patient in need . Unbreakable love: Neyens has suffered from kidney disease for most of her 53-year marriage to Bill. She received a kidney March 26 thanks to his generosity . On the day of Neyen's transplant, eight surgeons in four states linked five hospitals through transplants. Neyen, who's battled kidney disease much of her life, received her kidney after her husband--who was not a match for her--gave his kidney to someone else in need. In turn, Neyen received an organ from Matt Crane, 55, who lives outside of Philadelphia, reports ABC News. Crane's wife Michele's Type 1 diabetes caused her to need a new kidney, which she received thanks to her husband's donation. 'If it took for me to give my kidney to somebody in order to get Michele a good healthy kidney, I'm ready to do it,' Crane told ABC, which will air a story about the record-breaking chain on Nightline on Tuesday evening. The last length of this historic chain began at the University of Medical Center in Baltimore when Latwanya Goslee donated a kidney on behalf of her brother, who'd already received a transplant. Her kidney was driven 250 miles to Allegheny General Hospital in Pittsburgh, where it was transplanted into Gary Watson. A friend of Watson's daughter, 44-year-old paralegal Christine Brock, donated the kidney that allowed Watson to receive a transplant. Her organ was flown 368 miles to New Jersey then picked up by a courier and driven to New York City. Starts with altruism: The chain that ended with Neyes receiving a lifesaving transplant began months prior when Minneapolis attorney Kathy Hart gave a kidney without having a loved one in need of a transplant (FILE) A kidney was then taken from New York to Philadelphia and transplanted into Michele Crane. Her husband Matt's kidney was removed and taken to Madison, Wisconsin via a flight to Chicago and a 133-mile drive. That's where Neyen's received it. Et, voila. As ABC notes, these chains can't start without a donor who gives his or her kidney in exchange for nothing. This particular chain began with Kathy Hart, a Minneapolis attorney, who told ABC her unbelievably altruistic choice was an easy one to make. 'I think the fact that it was to a stranger is one of the parts that people have a really hard time grasping. But it actually even makes it easier,' she said. 'From the very beginning I didn't have an attachment to the outcome or any judgment attached to who gets it or who's deserving… I have an opportunity to give, and why wouldn't I?'
The head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, Michele Leonhart, is expected to resign soon, an Obama administration official said Tuesday. Leonhart is a career drug agent who has led the agency since 2007 and is the second woman to hold the job. She has faced mounting pressure from Congress, where some questioned her competence in the wake of a scathing government watchdog report detailing allegations that agents attended sex parties with prostitutes. DEA head Michele Leonhart, is expected to resign soon, an Obama administration official said Tuesday, as she faces mounting criticism from Congress that she's been unable to change the agency's culture . Leonhart was widely criticized for her response to the report and a group of lawmakers said in a statement that she was 'woefully unable to change' the agency's culture. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because a formal announcement had not yet been made. Lawmakers have been pushing for Leonhart's ouster since her disastrous appearance before the House Oversight Committee last week. A majority of the committee said they had lost confidence in her and said she 'lacks the authority and will to make the tough decisions required to hold those accountable who compromise national security and bring disgrace to their positions.' The Justice Department report that jeopardized Leonhart's job recounted allegations that drug agents attended sex parties with prostitutes, some funded by local drug cartels, in a foreign country. The DEA said the incidents happened in Colombia. Several Congressional members have criticized Leonhart's competence in the wake of a government watchdog report detailing allegations that agents attended sex parties with prostitutes . The no-confidence statement was signed by 13 House Democrats and nine Republicans, including Chairman Jason Chaffetz of Utah and the committee's top Democrat. Chaffetz went a step further, calling for Leonhart to resign or be fired. Last week, the White House voiced concerns about the Justice Department report. In a daily press briefing Tuesday, White House spokesman Josh Earnest wouldn't comment on reports that Leonhart was set to leave the agency and instead reiterated that the Obama administration had 'concerns about the material that was presented in the (inspector general) report that raised legitimate and serious questions about the conduct of some DEA officers. 'The president, as you know, maintains a very high standard for anybody who serves in his administration, particularly when it comes to law enforcement officials. And the I.G. report raised serious concerns about that conduct,' Earnest said. Leonhart has previously been the target of online petitions calling for her ouster after she distanced herself from the administration's stance on legalized marijuana, seen as a hands-off approach that lets states legalize marijuana so long as it is state regulated. In an email sent to employees last Friday, Leonhart lamented agent's 'disgraceful conduct' Marijuana remains illegal under federal law and is classified by the DEA as a Schedule 1 drug, along with drugs such as heroin and peyote. Leonhart also declined to fully endorse sentencing reform efforts supported by the Justice Department. CNN reports that Leonart sent an email to employees last Friday lamenting the recent scandals. 'This has been a very difficult week for DEA, with members of Congress and the media asking tough questions and sharing our outrage about the disgraceful conduct of a few individuals several years ago.' she wrote. 'This employee misconduct has upset me for many reasons, but especially because it calls into question the incredible reputation DEA has built over more than 40 years.' She ended the email thanking employees 'for your continued expressions of trust and confidence as we navigate through these rough waters. I know you will remain focused on our mission and the commitment to excellence that is the hallmark of who we are, and what we will always be at DEA.'
Arsenal's eight-match winning streak in the Premier League has taken even manager Arsene Wenger by surprise, according to the Frenchman whose side retain an outside chance of winning the title. 'I always hope to get the best out of my team, but no manager in the world if he is serious can predict a run like this,' Wenger told Arsenal's website. 'In the Premier League it's very difficult to predict.' Arsene Wenger admits he could not have predicted Arsenal's impressive run of results . Aaron Ramsey's goal against Burnley extended the Gunners' record to 16 wins in their last 18 games . Wenger has once again come under fire this season, with fans frustrated by Arsenal's failure to mount a serious title challenge and another last-16 exit in the Champions League. However, with an FA Cup semi-final this weekend and still the chance to chase down Chelsea in the table, Wenger's position at Arsenal is again looking secure. Arsenal have won 16 of 18 games in all competitions and Wenger believes the change in fortune is down to him finally having a relatively injury-free squad. 'It's down to the quality and the attitude of the team, the quality of the spirit we have in the side,' he said. Ramsey celebrates his goal, which helped Arsenal to maintain second place in the Premier League . Arsenal have a slim chance of winning the league, but they must catch Jose Mourinho's Chelsea to do so . 'We prepare (well), we prepare and contribute to our success, that is for sure. What people forgot is that we had big players out for four months this season. 'Six or seven players from the squad completely out. So that made a big difference. 'We have a better balance in the team and some players have made it like (Francis) Coquelin, who contributes to the balance of the team. Hector Bellerin as well has come into the team. 'And big players like (Laurent) Koscielny, like (Mesut) Ozil, like (Olivier) Giroud have been out four months in the season -- four months the three together! 'I have a quality bench and we even have quality players at home like Chamberlain, Arteta, Wilshere. I didn't even try to play Debuchy. We have a big squad and I think we have quality. 'Let's see how we finish the season and after see how we do next season.' Arsenal face Championship side Reading in the FA Cup semi-final this weekend and host Chelsea the following week.
Like super-models, they follow a strict daily diet — in their case, three carrots, an apple and a few cabbage leaves — to keep in shape for their public appearances. Over recent months, they have been feted across the globe and pampered wherever they go. One is even going to have a song written about his life. But when I meet Darius — the biggest rabbit on earth — and his similarly sized son, there is little evidence of diva behaviour. Former Playboy model Annette Edwards holds her world record Continental Giant rabbit Darius aloft . Five-year-old Darius is 4ft long and weighs just under 3st — the king of the Continental Giant breed. He is the size of an average eight-year-old child. Slightly wary, I join him on the floor of his owner's home in the Worcestershire village of Stoulton and find he is a thoroughly gentle soul. He sits quietly, as I stroke his ultra-soft, grey fur, and examine his outsized ears and paws. Darius seems nonchalant about his world record — and untroubled that he is set to lose his title to his son, Jeff. Aged only one, Jeff is already 3ft 8in long and weighs 2st. With a rabbit's peak weight and length kicking in at the age of two, Jeff has got some way to go. 'He's going to get bigger,' says their owner, Annette Edwards. 'His length is amazing. I think he might well take Darius's record.' Annette, a former Playboy model (not a Bunny Girl, it must be noted!), is a genius at giant rabbit-breeding. She has held the record for the world's biggest rabbit, with different animals, since 2008. It would be no surprise if Jeff took the title off his dad: after all, Darius took it from his own mother, Alice. Darius seems nonchalant about his world record — and untroubled that he is set to lose his title to his son, Jeff . Annette, who has owned 100 bunnies over the past ten years, says the art of giant rabbit-breeding is simple. 'It's the same as humans,' she says. 'Some breeders make the mistake of only having one big parent. Both parents have got to be big. Jeff's mum, Sally, is 3ft 5in long. She's one of mine, too.' The crucial thing is that rabbits from the same family shouldn't interbreed. 'You mustn't,' Annette stresses. 'You end up with all sorts of illnesses, and overgrown teeth.' Unsurprisingly, nutritious food is at the heart of giant rabbit- breeding, and Annette admits that Darius is 'very greedy'. As well as those daily carrots, apples and cabbage leaves, her brood have a bale of fresh hay a week between them. But, even with these hearty appetites, rabbit-breeding is a cheap hobby: £10 a week in grub for both bunnies. And medical care isn't expensive, either. 'They don't need much looking after,' Annette says. 'Only vaccinations against myxomatosis, and solutions to get rid of fly eggs.' Certainly, Darius — recently given a clean bill of health by vets — seems to be in very good condition, as well as being intensely relaxed. It's only when I boldly try to pick him up — it's like lifting a hefty toddler — that he struggles a bit. Apparently, he's a little shy of strangers but very affectionate once you get to know him. 'Darius has more experience with people,' says Annette. 'But he's a little slower. He plods around and follows me more. Jeff follows in his footsteps but he's more energetic because he's younger.' Annette is currently single but insists that sharing her home with giant rabbits hasn't affected her love life. 'No one has ever minded them,' she says, 'I'd only be with someone who likes animals.' She is clearly devoted to the rabbits and looks after them with great attention. 'A lot of giants only live until the age of five. But mine live to eight to ten.' On the sad day that they die, Annette's beloved bunnies are buried in the garden under a rose tree. This devotion to animals began in her childhood. 'I was an only child brought up by my grandmother,' says Annette, who herself is a grandmother of 14 and a mother of ten. 'I had a couple of rabbits as pets. I adored them — they were my little friends.' Giant genes: Jeff and his giant father Darius - who currently holds the record for being the world's largest rabbit . Annette had to put rabbits to one side when she embarked on a modelling career. She was Miss Birmingham at the age of 29, as well as the Face of Nivea and a Page 3 Girl. She still models — 'mostly magazine work' — and, three years ago, at the age of 60, she was the Sun's oldest ever Page 3 Girl. Her work took her around the world, including New York, where she appeared as a model in Playboy magazine. As her children started to grow up, Annette returned to her love of rabbits. A friend put her in touch with a rabbit dealer in Holland, where the Continental Giant comes from. In 2004, she bought Amy and Roberto — they were unrelated, so she could breed them. 'My family were a bit shocked — they thought they were the size of dogs! But I loved that they were so big, so gentle and loving — and very different.' At that stage, Annette had no intention of going for any records. But, after an article on her rabbits appeared in the local paper, she was asked if she had considered applying to the Guinness Book of Records. Like all world records, measurement had to be precise to the last millimetre and gram. To judge their body length, they had to be laid out and measured from front paw to back paw, with legs fully extended. And so it was, in 2008, that Annette learned that 3ft 3in long Amy was a world record holder. Annette has held the record for owner of the world's biggest rabbit ever since. Not surprisingly in this age of bizarre hobbies and record-collecting, there's keen competition — and Darius is insured 'for a lot of money'. Is his title under threat? Annette says: 'No one's come close so far.' Of course, I bet you are asking yourself whether what they say about the rampant breeding habits of rabbits is actually true. Well, the answer is: yes. Rabbits, giant or otherwise — left to their own devices — can produce 60 young a year. Competition: Darius the rabbit measures 4ft 4in long while 3ft 8in Jeff still has six months of growing to do . 'That's cruel — it would kill the mothers in the end,' says Annette. 'So I keep them to two litters a year, each of around four or five rabbits. 'It's important to keep them relaxed. When it's warm outside, they like to lie under a tree in the garden. But in cold weather I keep them indoors [in large dog crates] — although it's the damp you should be more worried about — it gets into their bones.' Annette says her rabbits are easy to have about her home. They roam around the kitchen, garden and a small barn. They don't have access to the rest of the house, although she sometimes takes them into the sitting room, wrapped in a blanket. The rabbits cost £500 a time for personal appearances and have regularly appeared on television — including the Paul O'Grady Show. A musician has asked if he can write a song in Darius's honour, and their record-breaking has featured in news bulletins all over the world. Still, the Kardashians of the rabbit world have kept their cool, and not given in to any of the wicked temptations of global celebrity. Whether Darius retains his title or his son succeeds him, you just know that there will be no bad blood between the two most famous rabbits in the universe.
The general in charge of the U.S. Army Recruiting Command has warned that America’s growing obesity epidemic ‘is becoming a national security issue.’ Major General Allen Batschelet says that 10 percent of young men and women who sign up to join the Army are currently refused because they are too heavy. Batschelet warns that current trends mean as many as half of young Americans will be so grossly overweight by the end of the decade that the military will be unable to recruit enough qualified soldiers. Scroll down for video . As many as half of young Americans will be so grossly overweight by the end of the decade that the military will be unable to recruit enough qualified soldiers. Major General Allen Batschelet says that 10 percent of young men and women who sign up to join the Army are currently refused because they are too heavy . 'The obesity issue is the most troubling because the trend is going in the wrong direction,' he told CNN. 'We think by 2020 it could be as high as 50 percent, which mean only 2 in 10 would qualify to join the Army. It's a sad testament to who we are as a society right now.' Of the 195,000 young men and women who signed up to fight for our country in 2014, only 72,000 qualified. Some didn't make the cut because they had a criminal background, too many tattoos or a lack of education - but 10 percent didn't qualify because they were overweight. According to the CDC, 81 percent of overweight boys and 71 percent of overweight girls believe they are just the right weight. Army recruiters, facing overweight prospective soldiers who are eager to sign up, have become fitness coaches - much like the trainers on NBC's The Biggest Loser. Boot camp: The maximum body fat percentage that the army allows for recruits aged 17-20 is 20 percent for men and 30 percent for females . The recruiters will spend time educating the hopefuls on diet and exercise and encourage them to lose the pounds necessary to qualify for boot camp. Many still fail to make the grade, but some do - such as a female recruit from Kansas who lost 80 pounds in a year so that she could sign up. 'We are the premier leader on personal development in the world,' said Batschelet. 'We want to see you grow and become a leader. That is a great strength in our Army.' The maximum body fat percentage that the Army allows for recruits aged 17-20 is 20 percent for men and 30 percent for females. The maximum a female soldier, aged 17-20, can weigh is 227 pounds, while the maximum for a male soldier in the same age group is 234 pounds and in both instances that is dependent on being 80 inches tall. Obesity rates have tripled in a generation with more than one-third of U.S. adults now considered obese, while 17 percent of all children and adolescents in the U.S. are obese. Army recruiters are having to act like the trainers on NBC's The Biggest Loser (ex-trainer Jillian Michaels pictured above) when they met prospective soldiers who are eager to sign up but are too fat to fight .
There was more drama than expected at a thespian awards ceremony this week, as an honoree slipped off the stage and nearly crushed musicians in the orchestra pit. Harrison Poe was announced as best supporting actor at the annual Tommy Tune Awards on Tuesday in Houston, Texas, but the high school student had a little difficulty navigating the stage. TV cameras caught him confidently getting up to accept the accolade before slipping and falling headfirst into the darkness. According to KTRK News, which was filming the event, Poe fell into a net covering the orchestra pit and luckily no one was hurt below. Scroll down for video . Caught on camera: There was more drama than expected at a thespian awards ceremony this week, as an awardee slipped off the stage and nearly crushed musicians in the orchestra pit . Going, going, gone: Harrison Poe was announced as best supporting actor at the annual Tommy Tune Awards on Tuesday in Houston, Texas, but the high school student had a little difficulty navigating the stage . The young bow tie-wearing actor went on to make a swift recovery and bounced back to the podium. However, he appeared to be a little shaken up from his fall as he proceeded to give his acceptance speech. 'Thank you! At least I'm alive,' Poe chuckled, while the packed auditorium continued to cheer. Red-faced: The young bow tie-wearing actor went on to make a swift recovery and bounced back to the podium - 'thank you! At least I'm alive,' Poe chuckled . 'He's just practicing to be Jennifer Lawrence one day, you know - tripping off the Oscar stage,' a news anchor later said of Poe's faux pas. Ironically, Poe was recognized for playing Paul in his school's production of A Chorus Line. In the musical, Paul falls and suffers a knee injury during a tap dancing audition and is carried off to hospital. Luckily, Poe did not require medical treatment this time around. The 13th Annual Tommy Tune Awards will air on ABC-13 on Sunday, June 21 at 12pm .
TV presenter Lisa Oldfield decided she had to make a change to tackle her weight after her son sketched an unflattering portrait of her. The 40-year-old former Channel 9 host said she barely recognised herself in the drawing, and was horrified to think her sons Harry, 4, and Bert, 2, saw her that way. 'When my son asked me if I was having another baby, that was the catalyst,' Oldfield told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . TV presenter Lisa Oldfield decided she had to make a change to tackle her weight after her son drew this unflattering portrait of her . Oldfield shared with Daily Mail Australia a picture of her stomach when she removed bandages after the surgery . 'He's delusional, but he thinks I'm the greatest person on the planet. If someone who loves me so much could think that, I knew I had to do something. 'I would try to hide the weight by strategically using my wardrobe, but it felt like I had somebody else's torso. 'I had been thinking about it for a few months and researching it, but that was the final straw.' Oldfield, wife of radio host and former One Nation politician David Oldfield, posted pictures of the 5.5 litres of fat she had removed online. She also showed Daily Mail Australia the aftermath of the surgery, complete with bruises and swelling she said will last 'a few weeks'. 'It's not a pretty picture,' she said. Oldfield posted this photo on her Facebook page of the 5.5L of fat she had removed during her liposuction operation . The mum-of-two said she had to do something, after trying to lose weight on her own. 'In the end, I just had to bite the bullet,' she said. 'I try and stay fit, I walk my dogs and that sort of thing, but I just can't be a slave to a gym. 'I'd rather spend extra hour and a half each night with my kids than with someone I'm paying $100 to scream at me.' Oldfield and her husband, David, who is a radio host and former One Nation politician . One of the main reasons Oldfield wanted to lose weight was so she could take more pictures with her children . Oldfield said she hated looking at pictures of herself after she gained weight . The surgery involved her doctor pumping Ms Oldfield full of water to separate the fat from the skin and muscle, which was then slowly sucked out. It cost $10,000. Oldfield, who still appears on Channel 9 regularly, said she hated looking at pictures of herself due to the weight she gained since having children. Oldfield was motivated to lose weight by her two children, Harry, 4, and Bert, 2. 'I just hated looking and feeling bloated,' she said. 'I have two beautiful little boys and barely any photos of them from the past two years. 'In the few photos we do have, I'm often using them to hide my big tummy.' Oldfield ahead of her Year 10 formal in secondary school . Oldfield and her husband, David, at the Easter Racing Carnival at Randwick Racecourse, in 2007 . Oldfield, who works full-time as a sales director, said the fat won't come back. 'One of the benefits of liposuction, is the fat can't come back to where it's been sucked out from,' she said. 'Worst case, I might get a little on my arms - but I have always had skinny arms and legs so I could maybe do with a little there.'
A carpenter from South California has created what may well be the world’s biggest see-saw. Kyle Toth, who runs his own custom woodworking business, built the seesaw from trees behind his workshop in Temecula. It measures a whopping 45ft in length, and according to its maker, sends its occupiers into the air at a height of around 25ft. Kyle said the tree was about 65ft long so he cut it to make it even on both sides and the seesaw was born . As seen in the video, the seesaw is made from entirely raw materials – a large trunk sits securely in between the natural split of a tree. Kyle told MailOnline: ‘I was cutting down some dead and damaged trees one day and was trying to drop this tree in between two others. ‘It didn't go as planned and ended up dropping in between a tree that had two huge branches splitting. ‘It fell basically where it is now but was about 65ft long and was laying on my fence. ‘So I cut the tree at what looked like would be even on both sides and just like that a massive teeter totter (American term for seesaw) was born. Kyle climbed the tree with a sledge hammer and pounded the trunk  into the split branches to stop it from sliding . There is no seat attached to the trunk but handrails have been added for support and ropes help people get on . ‘The whole thing kind of just happened. It ended up being the perfect weight on both sides. ‘I climbed up the tree with a sledge hammer and pounded the tree trunk down into the split branches to stop it from sliding. ‘I then called up a few of my friends and they came over really quickly once they heard.’ While there is no seat attached to the trunk, handrails have been added for support and ropes can be seen dangling from the base of it. Kyle said: ‘We had to attach a rope on one side so that when one person gets on they can pull the other person up and let someone else on. The seesaw measures  45ft in length, and according to Kyle, sends its occupiers into the air at a height of around 25ft . ‘I got on with one of my friends and it worked perfectly. It was a bit scary at first because it'll send you about 25ft in the air. ‘We used it for about 20 minutes. It’s so much fun. It takes the childhood ask of playing on a teeter totter and magnifies it by a thousand. ‘Basically if you were six-years-old and had never seen a regular teeter totter before that's what it would be like to see this thing as an adult.’ According to Kyle, four people can ride on the seesaw at one time and there is an amazing view from the top. The short clip, captured from two angles, shows two people riding the seesaw – one pumps the air in celebration and swings his dangling legs. Kyle said that the seesaw is a lot of fun and that it takes the childhood memory of playing on one and magnifies it by a thousand . Kyle's woodwork has been featured in the Providence Art Show, Boston’s World Trade Center Furniture Show and the Del Mar Woodworking competition in California . A number of people have commented positively on the video with one YouTube user writing: ‘That and a beer looks like a good time.’ The carpenter, who launched his business, Wood By Kyle Toth, in 2010 claims to have developed a passion for woodwork from a young age. His work has been featured in the Providence Art Show, Boston’s World Trade Center Furniture Show and the Del Mar Woodworking competition in California.
A device has been created that can scan entire planes for contraband, bombs and weapons. The mobile X-ray scanner, heralded as the world’s first ‘airplane scanner’, sweeps down a plane and can detect various objects inside. While the radiation emitted by the scanner is not safe yet for humans to be in the plane when it is operated, the company behind it thinks it could become a vital tool in aircraft safety. Scroll down for video . Romanian company MB Telecom has revealed the Roboscan 2M Aeria. It uses a cone of radiation to sweep across planes (shown) and look inside. The device is accurate enough to find a filament in a light bulb. But the radiation it emits is not safe for passengers yet . The Roboscan 2M Aeria is being developed by Romanian company MB Telecom (MBT). It costs €3 million (£2.1 million, $3.2 million), reported The Times, and is apparently already being used to check trucks at borders in Eastern Europe, where it has helped seize 76,000 packs of illegal cigarettes. On its website, MBT says the Aeria is ‘the very first solution for aircraft security inspection.’ It can scan planes from small private jets to medium-sized commercial airplanes. The company notes that, while passengers and their luggage are thoroughly inspected at airports, there is no such inspection process for jets arriving at small private airports with low security. But with their device, the company says this ‘gap’ in aviation security can be plugged, and it can scan an entire plane in about 20 minutes. The device can be used to detect weapons (shown) and other contraband in small or medium-sized jets that land at low-security airports . An operator working inside the truck can look inside the entirety of a plane, although currently under regulations some areas of the plane - such as the fuselage and wings - are restricted . There are four main components that allow an aircraft to be scanned. Armed with a sharp sense of smell, dogs have a long history of detecting explosives for their human handlers, and soon there could be sniffer elephants too. Researchers have found that the large mammals excel at identifying explosives by smell, stirring speculation about whether their extraordinary ability could save lives. Elephants could be used to detect land mines in areas that have seen conflict and could even do so at a distance with the aid of drones. The research was conducted in South Africa and involved the U.S. military. The first is the operating truck, from which an operator can use the system and look inside the plane. Attached to this is a robotic arm with an X-ray generator at the end. The plane is then pulled forwards by a battery-operated tug over a wide detection module. By firing X-rays out of the arm, a cone of radiation sweeps over the plane. The operator inside the truck is then given live images of the interior of the plane, and is able to scan its entirety for hidden items. It is apparently so accurate that it could pick out keys on a seat or even a filament in a light bulb. One issue, though, is that aircraft operators do not authorities to inspect the whole plane - areas of the fuselage and the wings are off limits, even though Roboscan can examine these areas. ‘You cannot touch it, but you can scan it,’ said Radu Tudor of MBT at the Counter Terror Expo in London this week. There are four main components that allow an aircraft to be scanned. The first is the operating truck (shown), from which an operator can use the system and look inside the plane .

Lucas Matthysse won a majority decision against Ruslan Provodnikov in a 12-round super lightweight bout on Saturday night. Matthysse landed the majority of the punches in the first round and opening a cut near Provodnikov's left eye early in the second. Provodnikov (24-3) put Matthysse on the ropes late in the third round and landed two hard right hook-left hook combos in the fourth before Matthysse (37-3) regained control in the fifth. He continued to use his three-inch reach advantage to keep Provodnikov at bay, giving him room to dodge the Russian's powerful left hook. Lucas Matthysse celebrates after his win against Ruslan Provodnikov at the Turning Stone Resort Casino . Provodnikov (right) lands an uppercut to the head of  Matthysse despite having a cut opened up early on . Provodnikov (24-3) put Matthysse on the ropes late in the third round and landed two hard right hook-left hook combos in the fourth before Matthysse (37-3) regained control in the fifth. He continued to use his three-inch reach advantage to keep Provodnikov at bay, giving him room to dodge the Russian's powerful left hook. Provodnikov landed several punches in the later rounds but couldn't knock down his Argentine opponent down, although he did stagger Matthysse in the 11th. 'He did, he hurt me,' Matthysse said through a translator. 'But I was able to withstand the onslaught. He's a very tough fighter. He's very strong. He just keeps coming forward.' Don Ackerman scored the fight as a draw 114-114, but Glenn Feldman and John McKaie both scored it 115-113 in favor of Matthysse. 'To me, he was better today,' Provodnikov said through a translator. 'He was the better man in the ring and, you know, it was a close fight but he won and I hope everybody enjoyed it.' The night's undercard was quickly decided when Patrick Teixeira (25-0, 21 KOs) won with a second-round knockout of Patrick Allotey (30-2) in their middleweight bout. Provodnikov admitted that Matthysse was better than him on the day in the majority decision win . Matthysse said he just wanted to rest but talked up a fight with Floyd Mayweather or Manny Pacquiao next . The sell-out crowd then had to wait more than an hour for the main event, watching the TV feed of Terence Crawford beating Thomas Dulorme for the vacant WBO junior welterweight title in Austin, Texas. WBO president Paco Valcarcel tweeted he would like to see Crawford defend his title against Matthysse, but the Argentinian had his sights set higher. 'For right now I just want to rest,' Matthysse said. 'I got my daughter, my family waiting for me back home. I want to rest. I want to go back there and see them so much and let's see what happens with (Manny) Pacquiao and (Floyd) Mayweather.' Matthysse and Provodnikov prepare to hug at the end of their fight on Saturday night in Verona, New York .
Prehistoric humans living in a cave 14,700 years ago were cannibals and made cups from the skulls of the dead, a new study has found. Researchers at the Natural History Museum in London and University College London have found evidence that the human bones found in Gough's Cave in Somerset had the flesh cut from them before being chewed and crushed. They found tooth marks on many of the bones, which were discovered in the cave during excavations between 1880 and 1992. Scroll down for video . This skull found at Gough's Cave in Somerset had been carefully shaped into a bowl around 14,700 years ago . Human skulls found in the cave had also been extenisvely shaped to create cups or bowls. The archaeologists behind the study say the findings suggest people living in the late Ice Age indulged in ritual cannibalism, perhaps as a macabre way to revere their dead kin. Simon Parfitt, an archaeologist from University College London, said: 'A recurring theme of this period is the remarkable rarity of burials and how commonly we find human remains mixed with occupation waste at many sites. There is growing evidence from around Europe that suggests preshistoric humans living at the time engaged in widespread cannibalism and other macabre rituals when dealing with their dead relatives. Stone Age farmers in Italy cut the flesh from the bones of their dead before burying them, a recent study found. Researchers at the University of Cambridge discovered cut marks on 7,000 year old human remains buried in a cave in Puglia, south eastern Italy. These cuts and scrapes, made with stone tools, suggest the skeletons had their flesh carefully removed in rituals before being placed in the cave. Archaeologists leading the research believe cleaning of the dead was probably the culmination of a protracted multi-stage burial process. Farmers from villages up to 12 miles away are thought to have brought their dead to the Scaloria Cave in the Tavoliere region of Italy . 'Further analysis along the lines used to study Gough's Cave will help to establish whether the type of ritualistic cannibalism practiced there is a regional phenomenon, or a more widespread practice found throughout the Magdalenian world.' Using modern radiocarbon techniques, researchers found the bones discovered in Gough's Cave were deposited over a very short period of time around 14,700 years ago - perhaps over just a few seasons. The humans who lived at the cave were a group of Cro-Magnon hunter-gatherers known as Magdalenians. It is thought these modern humans spread from southwest Europe and entered Britain from Belgium as the climate began to warm 15,000 years ago. The cave, which lies within Cheddar Gorge in Somerset, is around 295 metre deep. Human remains were first discovered there in the 1880s and in 1903 the remains of Britain's oldest complete human skeleton, known as Cheddar Man, was found there. A carving of a mammoth was also found in the cave along with thousands of flint tools. In the latest study, published in the Journal of Human Evolution, the researchers used three dimensional imaging techniques to examine the human remains found in the cave. They found scratches made by a stone cutting tool along with human teeth marks along the bones. The skulls also showed signs they had been stripped of their flesh before being broken and carefully shaped into a bowl. Several skulls and other bones (above) found at the cave showing distinctive human bite marks and cuts . Professor Chris Stringer holds the skull of Cheddar Man - the oldest most complete skeleton found in Britain . Dr Silvia Bello, who led the research at the Natural History Museum, said: 'We’ve identified a far greater degree of human modification than recorded in earlier. 'We’ve found undoubting evidence for defleshing, disarticulation, human chewing, crushing of spongy bone, and the cracking of bones to extract marrow.' She added: 'We find (cut marks) all over the skull and all over the face. 'We suspect that what they were doing was maticulously removing every single soft tissue on the skull. 'We have signs that indicate cutting of the lips, exctraction of the eyes and cheek and possibly cutting of the tongue as well. Skull fragments and facial bones found in Gough's Cave showed extensive cut marks that suggest the flesh was carefully cut away and now scientists believed the inhabitants in the cave indulged in ritual cannibalism . 'Once that was done it was possible to break and remove the facial bones and then very carefully going all the way along the skull doing some percussion or banging using a stone. 'It was a very careful process - they were really trying to create an object.' The gruesome treatment of human corpses at Gough's Cave mirrors similar finds at other ancient sites in central and western Europe. The researchers believe cannibalism may have been part of the customs of disposing of the dead. Professor Chris Stringer, an anthropologist who was involved in excavations at Gough's Cave during the 1980s and 1990s, said despite practicing cannabilism, these people were not much different from us today. He said: 'These people were Cro-Magnons - the people who lived in Europe in the last ice age. 'They were modern people, physically very like us, a bit more strongly built.'
More than 121,000 people worldwide are members of Mensa, an elite society that boasts some of the smartest brains on the planet. And you too could join this group if you can prove you’re in the top two per cent of the population in a supervised test.

A former lager lout who ballooned to 24 stone has lost nearly half his body weight by giving up his favourite drink. Rugby prop Dale Forrest, 26, of Bolton, would sink up to 12 pints a night, but decided to shed the pounds after seeing a photo of himself while out with his fitness fanatic friends. In December 2013, the bank teller decided to ditch the booze, give up his favourite fatty readymeals and greasy takeaways and hit the gym. Dale Forrest would drink up to 12 pints a night - and ballooned to 24 stone - before giving up beer to lose weight . Dale, pictured at his slimmest, was worried he would look like a 'beached whale' next to his friends on holiday . Since then, Mr Forrest, who had a holiday planned with his mates and didn’t want to look like a ‘beached whale’ next to them, has lost 10.5 stone. He said: ‘I can now go on nights out and feel confident - even without the Dutch courage. ‘I no longer feel like people are laughing at me and all it took was a bit of willpower.’ Mr Forrest struggled with his weight from a young age and in adulthood fell into unhealthy habits. Before shedding the pounds Mr Forrest ate a cheese and sausage bap for breakfast, a Big Daddy Box Meal from KFC for lunch and a meat feast pizza for dinner. Dale, pictured sitting down, said he would consume beer, alcopops and shots regularly on nights out . Dale, pictured before his weight loss (right) and after losing 10 stone, gave up greasy takeaways for healthy foods and started going to the gym regularly, and saw the pounds fall off . Despite being a rugby player, Dale weighed 24 stone due to his unhealthy lifestyle . He said: ‘I was inactive and ate and drank what I wanted. ‘All my friends were in really great shape. They got a lot of attention from girls and I got none, which was a bit depressing. ‘They were all quite careful about what they ate, but I thought nothing of having dinner at McDonald's regularly.’ Despite being a keen rugby player, Mr Forrest rarely exercised and lived on an unhealthy diet – and would regularly drink 12 pints of beer followed by shots and sugary alcopops on a night out with friends. He said: ‘I would drink in the pub with my friends every Friday and Saturday. ‘I would start off by having a few pints, then as I got a bit bloated I would switch to other drinks. By the end of the night I was downing Jaegerbombs and drinking alcopops.’ After a night out in December 2013, Mr Forrest logged on to Facebook to look at the pictures taken the night before. Dale is now taking part in a charity boxing match since losing weight . Dale, pictured before (left) during a rugby game, and (right) after losing more than 10 stone . He was horrified to see that he was nearly double the size of all his friends. He said: ‘I was shocked when I saw how big I was compared to my mates. ‘Me and the lads had just booked a holiday for the summer and I did not want to be the beached whale at the side of the pool. ‘I decided I had to change.’ Desperate to change, Mr Forrest set his alarm for 6am the next day so he could go to the gym. He said: ‘I had to drag myself out of bed - during the walk to the gym I felt like death and I struggled to find any motivation. ‘When I got to the gym things changed. I started with some weights and then did 15 minutes on the crosstrainer. ‘After I finished I felt I had achieved something, although it wasn't as hard as I thought it would be. ‘I got a taste for it and started going all the time.’ Dale said he would start the night drinking beer and then move on to shots and alcopops . Dale (left before losing weight) turned his life around and lost more than 10 stone thanks to healthy eating . The committed slimmer also overhauled his diet, swapping fatty takeaways for lean meat and fresh vegetables. Before his dramatic weight loss Mr Forrest would snack on chocolate bars and gorge on a fat-rich diet. Now he eats porridge with blueberries for breakfast, grilled turkey with boiled potatoes and vegetables for lunch and grilled fish with green vegetables for dinner. Throughout the day he snacks on nuts, fruit, celery and protein shakes. He also started going to the gym twice a day, weightlifting before work and doing cardio in the evening. By February 2014 Mr Forrest had lost an impressive 3st 7lb. He said: ‘The biggest change was kicking the booze. I still go out now but I've changed my drinking habits. ‘I drink lime and soda throughout the week and I'll switch to gin and tonic on a Saturday night. ‘Within four months people started to notice I had lost weight. My work clothes started getting really baggy as the weight fell off. ‘It was a good feeling every time I needed to go down a size, but it cost me a fortune to keep refreshing my wardrobe.’ Since losing more than ten stone, Mr Forrest has dropped from a 48-inch trouser waist to a 34-inch waist. He now weighs in at an even 14 stone. He is planning on taking part in a charity boxing match on April 18 for Cancer Research UK. He said: ‘I've changed my lifestyle completely. It was a lot of hard work - but it is the best thing I have ever done for myself.’
A grandmother was left feeling 'sick and scared' after she received a chilling ransom demand for her stolen dog. Vivienne Garton, 65, was devastated her 10-year-old West Highland terrier Ben was snatched from her garden in Knowle West, Bristol, earlier this month. She began an appeal to find him and put up posters near her home, but shortly after she received two phone calls from an anonymous man threatening to cut up her pet unless she paid £500. Scared: Vivienne Garton, 65, has been left devastated after her West Highland terrier Ben was stolen. She put posters (pictured) up near her home but since received an anonymous call threatening to cut up the dog . The caller gave the address of an empty house in Bristol and a phone number which she handed to police, who are now investigating. Mrs Garton, who lives with her husband and four grandchildren aged between eight and 18, says a number of her posters have now been ripped down. 'I feel sick. I have had him for ten years - he is my little baby. I just want him home safe. I'm so worried. I don't know who could do that to someone,' she said. 'I don't know if it is a hoax or if he has really been stolen by someone. It is scary. It was a man on the phone and he sounded middle aged. He said he would cut Ben up.' Loving pet: Mrs Garton's 10-year-old dog is partially sighted, partially deaf and cannot walk long distances and has been missing for a fortnight . Ben, who is partially sighted, partially deaf and cannot walk long distances, disappeared from the family home on Sunday April 12. Mrs Garton, who suffers from arthritis, explained that she sent the dog outside because he was hassling her while she was cooking Sunday lunch. But when Ben failed to come back  she grew concerned and went outside to find a hole in the hedge. She said that while it was possible he could have escaped it was very out of character and was unlikely that he wouldn't return. She said: 'There was a little hole in the hedge that he might have got through, but it is very out of character for him not to come back. 'We went straight out looking for him but there has been no sign of him ever since. I am worried he has been stolen and somebody has him in their garage.' A social media campaign, started by her neighbours, is becoming increasingly popular in the hope of returning the pet. She added: 'Friends in the area have been great and I have so much support from people. We are all worried sick and must have driven about 300 miles in the past week just looking for him. 'Sometimes we cross paths with other people out doing the same thing. The entire family is worried and stressed out about him. We've always been a dog-loving family - I have had dogs ever since I was little. Ben is the smallest one we've ever had and he is a member of the family now.' A spokeswoman for Avon and Somerset police said: 'We have received reports of threatening phone calls in relation to a lost dog. We are investigating an incident of blackmail.' Devastated: Mrs Garton says she has been left feeling 'sick and scared' after receiving the calls, which have now been reported to the police are investigating an incident of blackmail .
A Florida police department is in mourning after an officer was accidentally shot by a coworker during firearms training.

A St. Louis woman is doing all she can to stop the city from tearing down the house that has housed three generations of her family. Charlesetta Taylor, 79, has lived in her home for 70 years, and was a member of the first African-American family to live in her neighborhood, and now it and 49 others, may be bulldozed. This so the city can make way for a campus for the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. Scroll down for video . Charlesetta Taylor (above), 79, may have her home of 70 years torn down by the city of St. Louis . Taylor (above in the 60s) was part of the first African-American family in the neighborhood . 'We celebrated everything in here, and there was always something going on,' she said (above in front of the home) 'We were the first African-American family I know on this block and several other blocks around us,' Taylor told ABC News about her three-story brick residence. 'It was 1945, and there was a restrictive covenant restricting where African-Americans could live. But, nonetheless, my father was successful in buying this house for our large family.' That may all go away though, now that the city needs to keep the NGA, and the 3,000 jobs it provides, in St. Louis. The company creates maps and satellite imagery that is used by the military for national security, among other things. And if residents are not willing to move, the city says it will resort to eminent domain to take their homes. That would not just mean the loss of Taylor's home, but more importantly the loss of a lifetime of memories. 'We celebrated everything in here, and there was always something going on,' she said. 'During Christmas, dozens of kids would be here: all my siblings, cousins and, later on, their children and children’s children.' Taylor is pictured here at age 9 (in the upper right corner) with her siblings . The city may also tear down 49 other homes in addition to Taylor's (above) to make sure the NGA does not leave the city, and take the 3,000 jobs it provides . Taylor also pointed out that many of the other people who could lose their residences are elderly, adding; 'Our homes are not for sale.' A Change.org petition has been started, and already there are over 90,000 signatures. Three other sites are being considered and a decision is expected in March 2016. As Taylor says in her petition; 'We’ve lived in this neighborhood for generations and do not want to move.'
Wojciech Szczesny must use his current spell out of the Arsenal side as a catalyst to come back a stronger goalkeeper, according to former club legend David Seaman. Szczesny has found himself demoted to the substitutes' bench in recent months due to a combination of poor performances and the form of David Ospina since the new year. Gunners boss Arsene Wenger has benefited from competition for places brought by the £3.2 million signing of Colombian Ospina from Nice last summer, as eight consecutive wins have lifted his side to second in the Premier League. Wojciech Szczesny hasn't played a Premier League game since the 2-0 defeat to Southampton in January . David Ospina boasts the highest win ratio of any Premier League player to make more than 10 appearances . Szczesny is expected to line up in goal for Arsenal in Saturday's FA Cup semi-final against Reading at Wembley, and Seaman believes the Poland international can make the number one jersey his own once more. 'With Wojciech, it must be hard for him now to be number two, coming off the back of a season where he was a regular and had been playing at his best, but it is totally just because he had a couple of bad mistakes and Ospina has gone in and done his stuff,' Seaman said. 'Either of them could be Arsenal's number one, it is about who is on form - and if Ospina keeps his form, then he is going to stay there.' Former Arsenal goalkeeper David Seaman was speaking as an ambassador for the 'Know the Score' campaign against bowel cancer to Press Association Sport. Szczesny compounded his indifferent on-field performances by being caught smoking in the showers after defeat at Southampton on New Year's Day - the last time the 24-year-old started a league game for the North Londoners. But Seaman has every faith in the 6ft 5in deposed keeper, believing that if Szczesny takes the positives from a spell on the sidelines, he can emerge a far better goalkeeper in the years to come. The 51-year-old continued: 'It is not a difficult situation, but it keeps you on your toes to know that there is quality behind you. 'It is not just the games which make you play better, it is the training. 'The goalkeepers train together, and you see the other guy, you think "I want to be better than him" or "I am going to show him how good I am". That is day to day and is good because it brings the best out of you and tests you, so you become a better goalkeeper.' David Seaman is a former English goalkeeper who joined Arsenal from Queens Park Rangers in 1990 for £1.3m, a then British record transfer fee for a goalkeeper. He spent 13 seasons at the Gunners, winning the old First Division Championship and the Premier League twice. Seaman also won four FA Cups, a League Cup and the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup during his time at Highbury. In all, he made 564 appearances for the Gunners between 1990 and 2003, before joining Manchester City on a free transfer. A return of 11 wins from 12 starts has turned Ospina into a fans' favourite at the Emirates, but Seaman is only too aware of how quickly things can change in football, and has urged Szczesny to think carefully before making a decision on his future. 'Wojciech has a big choice now, but he has still got loads of time, I did not join Arsenal until I was 26,' said Seaman, who left Arsenal for Manchester City in 2003 after leading the Gunners to FA Cup glory over Southampton at the Millennium Stadium. 'It is about how he reacts, and what does the player want - does he want to play as a number one? Or is he happy being at a big club as a number two? 'It is all about his ambition. If he wants to be a number one somewhere, then how long is he going to have to wait? 'But if he leaves Arsenal, then it won't be the same level, because it is not until after they go, that all these guys realise how good Arsenal is.' When did Ospina join Arsenal? Arsenal signed Ospina from Ligue 1 side Nice last summer. The 26-year-old made close to 200 appearances for the French club during six seasons. How much did Arsenal pay for him? Originally signed as back-up and competition for Wojciech Szczesny after the Gunners No 2 Lukasz Fabianski joined Swansea, Ospina cost a paltry £3million. Is he of international calibre? Ospina had won 52 caps for Colombia and impressed during their run to the World Cup quarter-final in Brazil last summer. When did Ospina make his first appearance for Arsenal? Ospina made his debut for Arsenal in a 2-1 defeat by Southampton in the third round of the Capital One Cup back in September and only made one further appearance in the Champions League before 2015. When did he displace Wojciech Szczesny as No 1? Ospina was recalled to the starting line-up as Arsenal beat Hull 2-0 in the FA Cup third round in January after Szczesny was at fault for both goals during a 2-0 defeat by Southampton. It later emerged that the Poland goalkeeper was caught smoking in the showers after the game. Ospina kept his place for the league game the following week and has played every Premier League match since. Did you know... Ospina is brother-in-law to Real Madrid midfielder and Colombia team-mate James Rodriguez. The former Monaco star married Ospina's sister Daniela in 2011.
A section  of Arsenal and Liverpool fans left their seats empty at the Emirates Stadium for the first 10 minutes of their lunchtime Barclays Premier League clash in a protest against ticket prices. Supporters from both clubs say they are 'disgusted' at the continuing rise of ticket prices, with the protest coming in the aftermath of the announcement of the Premier League's £5.14billion TV rights deal with banners held up inside and outside the ground. With tickets at the sold-out Emirates starting from £64 for the 12.45pm kick-off, protesters hope the image of empty seats around the ground will raise awareness of the struggles fans face to meet the rising costs of following their clubs. Fans inside the Emirates Stadium display a banner reading: '£5bn and what do we get? £64 a ticket' The cheapest tickets for the lunchtime kick-off were £64, some of the highest prices in the Premier League . Supporters of both sides gathered outside the 60,000-capacity stadium before kick-off to show off banners against the rising costs of modern football. A banner inside the stadium, held between the home and away ends, read: '£5bn and what do we get? £64 a ticket'. Ahead of the game, Kelvin Meadows of Arsenal's Black Scarf Movement - who organised the event with Liverpool's Spirit of Shankly and Spion Kop 1906 fan groups - called ticket prices 'extortionate'. 'In the pursuit of money football has sold it's soul,' he said. 'The fans are that soul and no one cares about the match going fans. Arsenal and Liverpool fans unite outside the Emirates Stadium in a protest against ticket prices . Fans show off a banner reading 'FOOTBALL WITHOUT FANS IS NOTHING' outside the stadium before kick-off . 'We put up with late fixture changes, unreasonable kick off times and ridiculously high prices. We do it 'cos of the love of our team. 'But the tide is turning. Old rivalries are being put aside as fans from all clubs come together. Away fans help make the event but have to pay extortionate prices. Then we're told to "sit down, shut up".' Roy Bentham of Spirit of Shankly said: 'We want tangible reductions in line with what working class people earn. We may lose a generation or more of fans otherwise unless the footballing authorities wake up.' Further protests are expected after full-time at the Emirates.

When Lane Smith passed away in a freak accident last July, he left behind his heavily-pregnant girlfriend and their unborn son. But now, nearly eight months after his passing, the young Oklahoma family has been reunited in their first ever family portrait, thanks to some clever photoshopping by a local photographer. Kayli Henley was snapping pictures of six-month-old Taos and his 20-year-old mother, Sierra Sharry, when the young mom asked the photographer if she could make their family complete. So Henley took a photograph of Smith from the family and, with a ghostly filter, fitted the image around his girlfriend and son, as if he were standing over them. Scroll down for video . Family portrait: A photoshopped image shows Sierra Sharry holding her six-month-old son Taos with her boyfriend, the baby's father, Lane Smith, standing behind them. Smith passed away before his son's birth . Sharry called the ghostly final picture 'amazing'. 'Lane's not physically here with us, of course, but that picture represents to us that he is always watching over us and he will always be there for us no matter what,' she told KOCO. After sharing the image to her Facebook page, the photographer found that other people thought the image was amazing too. It has been liked more than 200,000 times and shared more than 25,000 times, and Henley has been inundated with requests to create other pictures for families who have lost a loved one. In a post shared on the Facebook page, Sharry explained that in July 2014, she and 26-year-old Smith had been nervous about the impending birth of their son. 'We were scared as any new parents would be but ready for the adventure together,' she said. Excitement: 26-year-old Lane Smith, pictured with his girlfriend in the couple's pregnancy announcement, died after hitting his head in an accident in July 2014. His son was born just a few weeks later . When she was around eight months pregnant, they went to jet boat races in El Reno, she recalled. But the weather was too warm for Sharry, so she left her boyfriend there with his family. 'When I left Lane that day I had no clue it would be the last time I'd see him,' she wrote. But in the early hours of the next day, she awoke to a call that Smith had been rushed to the OU Medical Center in Oklahoma City after he had fallen and hit his head. She and her mother raced to his side. They never considered his injuries could be life-threatening, but once they got there, they were given 'absolutely no hope that Lane was going to make it'. 'July 13th 2014 was the absolute worst day of my life,' she explained. 'I lost my best friend. The father of my unborn child. And since that day I have felt so empty inside. A part of me will forever be missing. I loved that man more than life itself.' Strong: Sharry said that part of her has been missing since the death of Taos' father but that the photograph allowed her to see her complete family for the first time. She is pictured in another image from the shoot . Missed: She said she knows that Smith, pictured left, will always be watching over her and their son, right . Their son was born just a few weeks later and when he approached six months, Sharry asked Henley, who is baked in Yukon, if she'd be able to put together a family photo. 'I just got to thinking, we don't have a picture with Lane in it,' Sharry explained to KOCO. So Rene created the photo that has since been shared thousands of times online. 'It brought me to tears,' Sharry wrote about the photograph. 'This is how I picture us. Taos and I living our lives the best we can with Lane ALWAYS watching over our shoulder.' Rene said she was happy to be able to help. 'As soon as I met Taos, he had a smile that was so contagious, the happiest baby boy, and he instantly captured my heart,' she said on her Facebook page. '[I] never knew if I could make this reality for them. So glad I could and they can cherish this forever.'
A man has been arrested in connection with the death of an imam found dead in his car. Abdul Hadi Arwani was found slumped in the back seat of his black Volkswagen Passat on Tuesday morning in Wembley, north west London. The 48-year-old Syrian national was an outspoken critic of the Assad regime and 'actively' campaigned against extremist, his family have since revealed. On Monday morning Scotland Yard confirmed that a 46-year-old had been arrested in  Brent, north west London, on suspicion of conspiracy to murder. A 46-year-old man has been arrested in connection with Abdul Hadi Arwani (pictured above) who was found dead on Tuesday . Police are appealing to anyone who may have seen Mr Arwani or his car in Wembley on either Sunday April 5 or Tuesday April 7 . He is being questioned at a central London police station while officers continue their appeal for witnesses. A Scotland Yard spokesman said authorities remained 'open minded' about the culprit's motive for killing the father-of-six who has been described as 'the most peaceful man you could wish to meet'. They would not comment on claims that a hitman had lured the preacher to the area on false pretences before shooting him repeatedly while sat in the back seat of his car. They want to speak to anyone who may have seen Mr Arwani or his car, a dark coloured Volkswagen Passat. It is understood that Mr Arwani visited the area where his body was found two days beforehand on Sunday 5, parking in the Havenwood area for 'a short while'. A post-mortem examination revealed he had died as a result of gun wounds. Counter-terrorism investigators were drafted by Metropolitan Police last week 'because 'of their expertise in the management of investigations with international dimensions and an established liaison network abroad'. They refused to reveal whether either Mr Arwani's passionate view of Syria or his connection to the An-Noor Mosque in Acton was being considered as a line of inquiry. Police have confirmed Mr Arwani visited the area where he was found dead two days before being fatally shot in his black car (above) Mr Arwani was thought to have been shot dead in his car. He has been described as 'the most peaceful man' by his family . Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.
Former Kayak world champion and two-time Olympic medalist Nathan Baggaley has been taken back into custody for allegedly assaulting a police officer at Byron Bay Blues Festival. The 39-year-old, who was already facing serious drug charges, was allegedly caught along with two other men in a toilet cubicle with white powder at around 4pm on Easter Friday. Newscorp reported the powder was found on a phone owned by Mr Baggaley. Nathan Baggaley has been taken back into custody after allegedly assaulting an officer that found him in a toilet cubicle with white powder . The kayker was reportedly disgruntled and allegedly slapped the hand of an officer before walking away. Mr Baggaley was apprehended when he reported for bail earlier this week at Tweed Heads police station. He was taken into custody and charged with assaulting a police officer, resisting police and escaping custody. Mr Baggaley's barrister, Nikolaos Siafakas, disputed that his client assaulted an officer, also calling into question the circumstances surrounding the incident on Good Friday. Denied bail: Mr Baggaley was charged with assaulting a police officer, resisting police and escaping custody . The Olympian will remain in custody after his bail application was rejected by Byron Bay Local Court on Thursday afternoon. Mr Baggaley has pleaded not guilty to the Bluesfest offence and his case will be heard at Tweed Heads Local Court on May 7. The fallen athlete was already on strict bail conditions, including a 9pm curfew, while he was awaiting sentencing for two serious drug manufacturing charges. The fallen athlete has pleaded guilty to drug manufacturing linked with a Tweed Heads drug ring . Earlier this week, charges were also laid  for a separate instance where Mr Baggaley allegedly supplied 10 Buprenophine patches, an opiate based pain medication, to a prisoner inside the Mid North Coast Correctional Centre. In February the disgraced athlete pleaded guilty to manufacturing a border-controlled drug and manufacturing a marketable quantity of methamphetamine that was linked to a Tweed Heads drug ring. The Australian Federal Police allege the ring had established two secret drug labs located in the Tweed Heads and on the Gold Coast. The drug supply charge will be heard at Lismore Local Court on June 2. Mr Baggaley was also charged with supplying a prohibited substance to a prisoner at the Mid North Coast Correctional Centre .
Thousands of people have signed a petition calling for a controversial weight loss advertisement to be pulled, as Katie Hopkins slammed those complaining about the posters as 'chubsters'. The bright yellow advert for Protein World has been put up in a number of London Underground stations and features a model in a bikini with the question: 'Are you beach body ready?'. But the campaign, which promotes the brand's weight loss collection, has attracted the ire of many social media users and body image campaigners, with some of the posters even being defaced. Scroll down for video . More than 45,000 people have signed a petition calling for this controversial Protein World weight loss advertisement featuring a woman in a bikini to be pulled . A change.org petition calling for the removal of the adverts has now attracted more than 45,000 signatures, while critics of the billboard, unhappy at the insinuation that only those who resemble the model, 24-year-old Renee Somerfield, have the appropriate figures for the beach, have started a hashtag #everybodysready. Now Katie Hopkins has waded into the row, dubbing those who have been vandalising posters 'chubsters', and saying they should turn their efforts to exercising instead. Hopkins, who has been outspoken about weight in the past, tweeted: 'Chubsters, quit vandalising Protein World ads and get your a*** running on the road. Feminism isn’t an excuse for being fat. Eat less move more. 'Ads for ‘beach body ready’ vandalised. Society has huge acceptance for being fat - but masses of abuse for being skinny.' 'We are cheer leading chubsters; "brave" "beautiful inside and out" but we are quick to shame those with self control, eating in moderation.' The former Celebrity Big Brother star, who has made a documentary about her own weight gain and loss, later added: 'Let's get the @ProteinWorld ads at the top of stairs and steep hills. Get the chubsters with their sharpies shifting their chubby a****. Hopkins tweeted: 'Chubsters, quit vandalising Protein World ads and get your a*** running on the road' Katie Hopkins has previously been outspoken on the issue of weight, and wrote on Twitter that 'society has a huge acceptance for being fat - but masses of abuse for being skinny' Hopkins spoke out against those campaigning for the advert to be withdrawn on Twitter . Hopkins later declared that she was going on a run, and encouraged 'angry chubsters' to chase her . 'Off for a run. Angry chubsters - feel free to catch me and tell me about your 'medical issues' @ProteinWorld'. The change.org petition states: 'Protein World is directly targeting individuals, aiming to make them feel physically inferior to the unrealistic body image of the bronzed model, in order to sell their product. 'Perhaps not everyone’s priority is having a ‘beach body’ (by the way, what is that?), and making somebody feel guilty for not prioritising it by questioning their personal choices is a step too far. 'A body’s function is far more intricate and important than looking ‘beach ready’, so in fact it is Protein World who have confused their priorities, if anyone.' The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said it has received 216 complaints about the ad, and a spokeswoman said the general nature of the complaints is that the ad is 'offensive, irresponsible and harmful because it promotes an unhealthy body image'. An investigation has not been launched but the ASA said they are 'carefully assessing' the complaints to 'establish if there are grounds for further action'. Online fitness store Protein World, who claim the image has not been doctored using Photoshop, have also been actively engaging in the furore on social media, strongly defending their campaign with some biting responses to aggrieved Twitter users. Richard Staveley, head of marketing at Protein World, said it was 'great' that Hopkins had added her voice to the debate. 'I think much of what is being said and shared online Katie is obviously in agreement,' he said. Hopkins was regularly seen exercising during her time in Celebrity Big Brother . 'It's great to have somebody of such high profile getting involved at all, because it's obviously something that we want to be discussed. 'We want to encourage discussion on this. Ultimately we want to encourage a healthier, fitter nation. We want to encourage everybody to be the very best version of themselves. 'It has been quite odd how many people we've found who are far quicker to fit shame than fat shame. 'And you know if that makes us bad then so be it, and if Katie Hopkins is in agreement with us then we're delighted,' he said. Last week Hopkins was blasted by the UN's High Commissioner for Human Rights after she likened migrants to cockroaches. A change.org petition calling for the removal of the adverts has now attracted more than 43,000 signatures, while critics of the billboard have started a hashtag #everybodysready . Many of the posters have been doctored, including this version which had been put up on  a train . Another campaigner has their say on one of the Protein World posters . Jordanian Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein said the reality television star had used language in her Sun column similar to that used by newspapers and radio stations in Rwanda before the 1994 genocide which led to hundreds of thousands of people being slaughtered. Mr Staveley said Protein World has no official relationship with Hopkins, adding: 'We don't endorse any of her other comments or views necessarily.' The company's Twitter account retweeted Hopkins but Mr Staveley said a retweet does not mean endorsement, adding that it was 'great' to have someone with such a 'strong following' wade in to the debate. He said there is 'no concern' on behalf of the company regarding the petition. Katie Hopkins has described those campaigning against the controversial Protein World 'Beach Ready' adverts as 'chubsters' 'We won't be removing the ad. I mean, there's more than two and a half million people use the London Underground every day and, like I say, sales have considerably jumped, so regardless of that 40,000 I think I can comfortably say that we've had ... it's been better for us, there's been far more positive reaction than negative,' he said. Mr Staveley said they 'always welcome constructive criticism" but said there were "some serial perpetual complainers out there'. He said some of the criticism has demonstrated 'irrational extremist behaviour', such as the 'vandalising' of adverts. Mr Staveley said Protein World is 'not a faceless corporation that's just going to sit silently', adding: 'We're a brand with a personality and that means there will be certain level of engagement across our social media channels which might take some people by surprise.' He said he fully endorsed that engagement, adding: 'That's part of our strategy.' Protein World’s Twitter account has tweeted that it is 'Here to motivate, not commiserate', and used the hashtag #getagrip. 'We are a nation of sympathisers for fatties,' a spokesperson for Protein World tweeted to one user after she signed the change.org petition calling for the removal of the advert. 'Why make your insecurities our problem?' Mr Staveley said if significant 'vitriol' is directed towards Protein World, they are not going to 'sit back and ignore it'. The model at the centre of the controversy has also responded to the 'contradictor' drama, citing the irony of people getting angry about body shaming, whilst body shaming her. 'I think nearly every ad campaign you have ever seen is open to interpretation. But saying the ad is body shaming by body shaming the image is very contradictory. Two wrongs don't make a right,' she told the Huffington Post. Australian Ms Somerfield, who is a strict vegan, said: 'I am a real person behind the image. I work very hard and live a healthy and active lifestyle which is why Protein World chose me for their campaign. I couldn't work every day as a full time model by starving myself, dieting or not looking after my body. Nourish your body, be kind to it and it will love you right back, no matter your size. 'I agree that ALL bodies are 'beach body ready'. Skinny, curvy, muscular, petite, tall, short, young and old. Confidence is beautiful no matter what size you are.... Your reflection doesn't define your worth.' According to its website, Protein World is 'leading the protein revolution with a new and innovative range of pure, GMO-free supplements to help you become healthier, leaner, fitter and stronger'. It says their weight-loss supplements will 'help raise your metabolism and burn fat fast'.
An Italian priest has been sacked amid claims that he took part in gay orgies with a Swiss Guard. The prelate was sacked from a religious order in Taranto after one of his online lovers contacted the church authorities with a dossier containing alleged evidence of sex with prostitutes, role play and explicit gay web chats. The priest allegedly favoured sexual role-play scenarios in which his lover played the disciple Judas Escariot, and had to atone for his betrayal of Jesus by becoming his slave. Controversy: News of prelate being sacked after an online lover contacted Taranto church authorities with a dossier containing alleged evidence of sex with prostitutes is just the latest sex scandal to engulf the Vatican . The diocese confirmed that the priest had been dismissed but claimed there were no other prelates involved. Turn-on: The priest allegedly favoured sexual role-play in which his lover played Judas Iscariot, and had to atone for his betrayal of Jesus (pictured) A 32-year-old man, from Rovigo in northeast Italy, claimed he was contacted by the unnamed priest around six months ago on Facebook. The man, an unemployed labourer, said he was having problems at the time and thought that 'it could have been a sign from heaven.' 'I needed spiritual help,' he told Corriere della Sera. The priest revealed that he was gay during online chats and attempted to seduce the labourer. 'He told me my pictures made him excited and asked me to send him an intimate photo,' the man claimed. The pair also had a video conversation via Skype, during which the priest was allegedly naked. The priest allegedly said that he had organised orgies with priests and a Swiss Guard, although church authorities have not said anyone else was involved. The labourer said that he was not gay but did not want to risk losing the spiritual support of the priest, who he claimed even convinced him to leave his girlfriend. 'He told me that he liked guys, especially young ones, and that he could do everything for them, also help them to buy clothes, mobile phones and recharge costs,' he claimed. Protection: The Italian priest was sacked amid claims that he took part in gay orgies with a Swiss Guard. The Swiss Guard serves as the de facto military of Vatican City . A statement by the diocese of Taranto said: 'Regarding the reports about a parish priest in the archdiocese of Taranto or rather his morally reprehensible conduct, utterly incompatible with ministry, the Curia notes the following. 'The priest in question who is not part of the Taranto clergy but of a religious order has been removed from pastoral care by bishop Filippo Santoro after verifying the facts. 'The religious are no longer in Taranto since last week. In the documents with the ecclesiastical court there is no trace of other priests being involved.'
Fox News anchor Chris Wallace has issued an apology after 'fat shaming' Kelly Clarkson in a radio interview, saying that he should have spoken of the singer's 'remarkable talent', not her weight. During the interview with conservative talk show host, Mike Gallagher, the 67-year-old was asked: 'Have you seen Kelly Clarkson? You know the singer, Kelly Clarkson? Holy cow, did she blow up.' In reply, he said the 'American Idol' winner has 'a lovely voice', but added that she 'could stay off the deep dish pizza for a while'. Within minutes, Wallace's response had sparked outrage online. Now, the veteran news man has apologized for his 'offensive' remarks - which he made on the nationally-syndicated Mike Gallagher Show on Friday - in a statement obtained by DailyMail.com.

Firestorm: Fox News Sunday anchor Chris Wallace (right), 67, faced wide-spread criticism after fat shaming Kelly Clarkson (left) on Friday, saying the singer and new mom could 'stay off the deep dish pizza for a while' Dealing with it: The same day, Kelly Clarkson told chat show host Ellen DeGeneres that she's had to deal with criticism about her weight since she first hit the spotlighton the first season of American Idol in 2002 . In the statement, Wallace said: 'I sincerely apologize to Kelly Clarkson for my offensive comment. I admire her remarkable talent and that should have been the focus of any discussion about her.' Clarkson, who coincidentally spoke of criticism about her weight on The Ellen DeGeneres Show the same day, is married to talent manager Brandon Blackstock. They have a nine-month-old girl, River. Following Friday's interview, Wallace's fellow Fox News anchor, 60-year-old Greta Van Susteren, almost immediately took to her blog to chastise her colleague over his comments to Gallagher. 'This "guy snickering" about her weight is obnoxious. He should apologize,' Van Susteren wrote. Meanwhile, Twitter users condemned Wallace for his 'disgusting' remarks. One wrote: 'Chris Wallace you're disgusting how dare you fat shame a woman who gave birth less than a year ago.' During her appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Clarkson revealed that since she appeared on 'American Idol' in 2002, she has had to  deal with people being mean about her body shape. On Kelly's side: Following Friday's interview, Wallace's fellow Fox News anchor, Greta Van Susteren (above), 60, almost immediately took to her blog to chastise her colleague over his comments to Mike Gallagher . Tweet: 'This "guy snickering" about her weight is obnoxious. He should apologize,' Van Susteren wrote . Mom-and-baby bag: Ellen surprised Kelly, whose daughter River was born in June 2014, with a baby bag that dispenses 'mommy juice' after the singer said she sometimes prefers wine to workouts on Friday's show . 'I was the biggest girl in the show, too. And I wasn’t big, but people would call me big. Because I was the biggest one on Idol and I’ve kind of always gotten that,' she told the  host. Referring to British TV personality, Katie Hopkins, who has tweeted a string of rude comments about her, she added: 'People are like, I’m so sorry that lady in London was so mean to you. 'I’m like, are you serious? Like get in line.' In an interview with Access Hollywood in early March, Hopkins, 40, defended her position on the Heartbeat Song artist, declaring that 'ultimately, Kelly Clarkson is a chunky monkey.' Proud mom: The singer brought along her adorable nine-month-old daughter River and introduced her to the comedienne backstage at The Ellen DeGeneres Show . Happy and successful: Kelly's new album Piece By Piece debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 Chart, making it her third number one album . But Clarkson told Ellen she feels bad not for herself but for other woman. 'I think what hurts my feelings... is that I’ll have a meet and greet after the show and a girl who is, like, bigger than me will be in the meet and greet and be like, 'wow, if they think you’re big, I must be so fat to them", she said. The new mother, who gave birth to her daughter in June 2014, revealed on the popular TV chat show that she takes a philosophical approach to comments about what she looks like. 'We are who we are. Whatever size,' the 32-year-old said. She added: 'I’m such a creative person that I yoyo. So sometimes I’m more fit and I get into kickboxing hardcore. And then sometimes I don’t and I’m like.. I’d rather have wine.'
Half of hospitals in England are allowing patients to jump NHS queues for cataract surgery if they pay for it themselves, new figures reveal (file picture) Half of hospitals are letting patients jump NHS queues for cataract surgery if they pay for it themselves, an investigation has revealed. Some are charging up to a ‘shameful’ £2,700 for one eye – treble what it costs the health service – raising suspicions that they are ripping off elderly patients. Cataract treatment is being rationed in England to save money, even though the NHS recently announced it would fund weight-loss surgery for 15,000 obese adults every year at a cost of £6,000 each. Yesterday the Mail revealed how millions was being wasted on prescriptions for suncream and toothpaste. Many NHS trusts have imposed arbitrary rules to determine who is eligible for cataract treatment, and patients who cannot read, sew or watch television are routinely turned away. Those patients who do meet the strict criteria often have to wait eight months for treatment, over which time their eyesight deteriorates further and impairs basic tasks and hobbies. Freedom of Information responses from 78 hospital trusts in England obtained by the Mail found that 41 offered patients the opportunity to pay for cataract surgery themselves. The operation usually costs the NHS between £800 and £900 per eye, but some trusts are charging up to £2,700. Campaigners accused hospitals of profiting from elderly patients. Clara Eaglen, from the Royal National Institute of Blind People, said: ‘It’s shameful that people are being asked to consider funding their own treatment when they are entitled to it for free, and in a timely manner, on the NHS. Scroll down for video . ‘We strongly believe that everyone who has a sight-threatening condition deserves early access to treatments.’ Caroline Abrahams, of Age UK, said: ‘In the last few years it has become harder to access cataract surgery as people are forced to wait for their sight to significantly deteriorate before getting help. ‘It is extremely worrying if people whose sight is starting to fail feel the only way to get help quickly is to pay for it. ‘Cataracts are extremely debilitating and treatment should be based on a clinical need not age or bank balance.’ Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients’ Association, added: ‘The NHS belongs to the people, and all patients have the right to access appropriate treatment at the right time and in the right setting, irrespective of their ability to pay; we cannot and should not have a two-tier NHS.’ In England, 41 hospital trusts said they offered patients the opportunity to pay for cataract surgery. The operation costs the NHS about between £800 and £900 per eye, but some trusts are charging up to £2,700 . More than half of over-65s suffer from cataracts, which are cloudy patches in the lens that make vision blurred or misty. Sight can be restored in a simple 45-minute operation, with doctors using ultrasound waves to break up the cataract. Most hospitals charge patients between £700 and £1,000 per eye for cataract treatment and say the money is spent on improving services. But this rises to £2,552 at Frimley Park Hospital in Surrey and £2,700 at Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust in Kent. Several trusts actively encourage patients to ‘self-fund’. The University Hospital Southampton’s website informs patients that ‘surgery will be offered much sooner than the usual NHS wait’. It adds: ‘Our cataract choice service offers a new option, between the traditional private sector and the NHS, bringing private healthcare within the reach of many more people.’ Yeovil District Hospital in Somerset says its private cataract service will ‘help you get back to the things you love’. Patients at North Cumbria are offered free parking and a daily newspaper, while at Frimley Park they can choose from an ‘exclusive a la carte menu’, which includes whitebait and chicken goujons.
Javier Hernandez made it six goals in eight starts as Real Madrid kept up their pursuit of Barcelona at the top of La Liga with a 4-2 win over Celta Vigo. Chicharito is currently scoring a goal every 83 minutes with a scoring ratio that is only two minutes short of Lionel Messi who nets once every 81 minutes. The Manchester United loanee put his team in the Champions League semi-finals in midweek with the winner against Atletico Madrid and in Baliados on Sunday night he scored twice to keep Real in the title race. READ PETE JENSON'S FULL MATCH REPORT HERE . Host commentator . Real Madrid are now just two points behind league leaders Barcelona. Chelsea may have wrapped up the title in England but it seems like the La Liga race will go right down to the wire. Real Madrid will have Hernandez to thanks for tonight's win as his two goals were decisive in their win over Celta. The home side the better side for large stages throughout the game but Real's quality in the final third made the difference. Yet another sign of respect by Ancelotti towards Celta. The Italian tactician now has six defenders on the pitch following the arrival of Arbeloa. Real Madrid now have three at the back with Carvajal and Marcelo acting as wing backs. Ancelotti's tactical switch shows just how much of a threat Celta have been during the 80-odd minutes or so. Hernandez will not get the chance of scoring a hat-trick as Ancelotti has decided to take the Mexican off. Pepe has been brought on to shore up the back-line. It's that man Hernandez again. Sergio Ramos runs up the pitch before playing a delightful through pass to Hernandez with the outside of his foot. The Mexican then takes one touch to bring the ball down before placing the ball into the net. A fine goal by the Real Madrid loanee. Some great football being played by Celta - and remember their wage bill is €12m compared with the €17m Real pay Ronaldo. But they are inevitably leaving themselves wide open on the counter. An equaliser doesn't look far off as Real fail to get to grips with Celta. The away side continue to counter attack with Hernandez going close after a neat run from the halfway line. Real Madrid are playing with fire. The home side should have been given a penalty as Kroos has just swiped the legs of Orellana, who was racing towards goal. Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti may have to freshen his side up during the next 10 minutes or so. They are still look far from convincing. Here's a reminder of who the Italian tactician can call on from the bench. Real Madrid subs: Navas, Pepe, Coentrao, Lucas Silva, Arbeloa, Nacho, Jese . Ronaldo has always scored against Celta Vigo whenever he has faced the La Liga outfit while wearing a Real Madrid shirt. He will be desperate to add to his outstanding tally of 39 league goals. No Bale and Benzema, no problem - Chicharito and James Rodriguez very good in the first half. Celta still in it but to play that well in the first 45 minutes and to go in at half time losing, it will be hard to lift themselves again. Real Madrid are extremely fortunate to be winning this game. Celta have looked assured and have really troubled their opponent's back-line. Nolito opened the scoring before Real took the lead thanks to goals by Toni Kroos and Javier Hernandez. Celta looked to be heading into the interval on level terms after Santi Mina's goal, however James Rodriguez struck before the break to make it 3-2 to Real. Real Madrid's luck appears to be in tonight as James Rodriguez has just scored an extremely fortunate goal. His shot is heading towards the arms of Sergio, in the Celta goal, until his shot deflects into the opposite corner and lands in the back of the net. Real do not deserve to be winning this game. Ronaldo almost puts his side back in the lead. The Portuguese forward races past Celta's defence before unleashing a low shot which looks destined to be heading for the back of the net. However his left-footed drives smashes against the post and rebounds to a Celta player. Remains 2-2. Barcelona will be delighted with the scoreline and Celta Vigo's performance during the opening 40 minutes of tonight's game. The home side continue to look the better side but they must be wary of Real's threat on the counter-attack. Real appear to be struggling in the absence of two members of the famous 'BBC' trio. They seem to be missing the pace of both Bale and Benzema in the final third. Not just because he's just scored, and not just because he scored four in one game two weeks ago, but 19-year-old Santi Mina is going to be one hell of a player. What is going on here? Just as we think Real are starting to find second gear - Celta go and grab an equaliser. This time it is Santi Mina who beats Casillas. He smashes the ball against the woodwork before tapping in the rebound from close range. One man who does seem to have taken confidence from the win over Atletico id Hernandez. He may have had to make do with a place on the bench during the majority of the season but he is now showing his worth. Hernandez shows a burst of pace before finishing past Sergio. I expected Real to come into this match with an extra bounce in their step following their win over Atletico but it has been the complete opposite. They look rattled and have really struggled during the opening 20 minutes of tonight's match. Second big assist in a week from Ronaldo. He's after his 40th league goal tonight. Celta have scored 38 as a team - that's what they are up against. It didn't take long for Real to get back on level terms. Ronaldo goes on a dangerous run down the right but fails to pick out a Real Madrid team-mate. The ball eventually falls to Kroos, who has the easy task of side-footing the ball into the net. Game on. Celta Vigo, who have started the brighter of the two sides, score by hitting Real on the counter attack. Nolito bursts down the left before cutting in between two defenders and shooting low past Iker Casillas. Fully deserved lead for the home side. Bright enough start from Celta. Ancelotti has not won here in any of his previous three visits with three different teams - Juventus, Milan and Madrid last season. Celta have started the match brightly with Real having to sit back and deal with their opponent's attacking threat. It looks like they will not be afraid of the European champions which should make for a good spectacle. Evidence shows that Real Madrid have a better win percentage without their Welsh wizard. Read Ben Nagle's piece on Bale's impact HERE. Manchester United's Javier Hernandez will lead the line for Real Madrid due to the absence of Karim Benzema. The Mexican international will be high in confidence following his late winner in the Champions League against rivals Atletico. Real Madrid XI: Casillas, Carvajal, Varane, Ramos, Marcelo, Kroos, Illarramendi, Isco, Rodriguez, Hernandez, Ronaldo . Real Madrid subs: Navas, Pepe, Coentrao, Lucas Silva, Arbeloa, Nacho, Jese . Celta Vigo XI: Sergio, Hugo Mallo, Cabral, Fontas, Jonny, Augusto, Krohn-Dehli, Orellana, Santi Mina, Nolito, Larrivey . Attention switches from the Barclays Premier League to the La Liga title race as Real Madrid face Celta Vigo at Balaidos in tonight's evening kick-off. The European champions will be desperate to claim all three points in order to pile pressure on rivals Barcelona. Carlo Ancelotti's side will have to make do without the injured Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema and Luka Modric. Real Madrid will be hoping to follow up their late Champions League triumph against rivals Atletico Madrid by picking up all three points against mid-table Celta Vigo. League leaders Barcelona piled pressure on Real by defeating Espanyol 2-0, to leave the Catalan giants five points clear at the top of the table. Carlo Ancelotti will have to make do without the injured Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema and Luka Modric for Sunday evening's encounter at Balaidos, however the Italian tactician will be able to call on the services of a rejuvenated Javier Hernandez.
David Cameron will put small business at the heart of the election campaign today by declaring that the Conservatives are ‘the party of the grafters’. The Prime Minister, who has faced criticism over a campaign lacking in passion, said he made ‘no apology’ for focusing on the economy, insisting: ‘Nothing matters more.’ He will appeal to small firms and the self-employed, saying while Labour sneers at those who work hard, his party backs them. Scroll down for video . David Cameron will put small business at the heart of the election campaign today by declaring that the Conservatives are ‘the party of the grafters’ Yesterday, Mr Cameron defended his campaign against criticism it is too narrow. ‘If you want political excitement, maybe you could go to Greece,’ he said. ‘That’s an exciting country, I am told. I don’t think that’s exciting – I think that’s terrifying. ‘When you get a new job, a new home, get a new childcare place or start a new business... now that’s truly exciting. If you want to take a risk, vote for the other man. My God, he’s got plenty of risks.’ He said Labour’s ‘disastrous’ plans for higher taxes and borrowing would risk the stability of people’s lives. And he told voters: ‘I want you to think about the three million low-paid people we have taken out of income tax, I want you to think about the two million jobs that we have created, I want you to think of the cuts in youth unemployment that we’ve achieved. I want you to think of that and I want you to take that argument that Labour make and stick it where the sun don’t shine.’ Mr Cameron went on: ‘Some people are saying to me, “You are putting too much emphasis on a strong and stable economy and securing our future”. I plead guilty.’ The Tories will today unveil a separate manifesto for small businesses, calling them ‘the lifeblood of the economy’. Thousands of small business leaders will back the party in an open letter. The Prime Minister, who has faced criticism over a campaign lacking in passion, said he made ‘no apology’ for focusing on the economy, insisting: ‘Nothing matters more’ And Mr Cameron – who is understood to have ordered that all campaigning activity is now dedicated to the economy – will set out new proposals to support millions of small firms and self-employed. He is to promise tax breaks and start-up loans, and an end to another £10billion-worth of red tape, to enable the creation of 600,000 businesses a year. The Tories are also promising to review the disadvantages faced by the self-employed, who make up 15 per cent of the workforce. In an echo of the campaign rhetoric of Margaret Thatcher, who famously celebrated Napoleon’s supposed dismissal of Britain as a ‘nation of shopkeepers’, Mr Cameron will say: ‘Small businesses are the backbone of our economy – and Conservatives are behind them 100 per cent. We’re the party of the grafters and the roofers and the retailers and the plumbers. ‘We get them, we respect them, we understand them, we back them. Where Labour sneer, we cheer.’
Ruby Walsh appears to jump his horse over a moving car in the latest promotional advert for betting firm Paddy Power. The 22-second clip shows the two-time Grand National winner galloping towards the speeding silver car and apparently jumping it as the bookmaker gears up for Saturday's big race at Aintree. Irish jockey Walsh, who is riding Ballycasey in the race, starts the clip by saying: 'This is how I've been getting ready for this year's Grand National.' The clip starts with champion jockey Ruby Walsh describing how he will prepare for the Grand National . The two-time National jockey appears to then leap over the speeding car on his horse . The horse clears the car, which Paddy Power say was travelling at 40mph, and lands . Walsh celebrates with a raised arm after completing the 'stunt' Paddy Power claims he jumped straight over the car, which was said to be travelling at 40mph. The horse barely clears the car's roof before landing. Walsh stands upright and raises his right arm in apparent celebration after the horse lands and gallops away. It is not the first time the bookmaker has produced a controversial advert ahead of a major racing festival. In February 2012, a publicity stunt prior to the Cheltenham Festival featured a suited hitman firing tranquillizer darts at unsuspecting members of the public, promising to 'take care of the chavs - veterinary style.' It was inspired by loutish racegoers fighting at Ascot. Another advert released ahead of the 2012 Cheltenham Festival showed a clip of transgender racegoers and invited viewers to spot the 'stallions' from the 'mares.' Walsh pictured after riding Sempre Medici to victory on Irish Grand National Day at Fairyhouse last week . The Irish jockey will ride Ballycasey in Saturday's Grand National at Aintree . It was banned from television broadcast by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) after it received 92 complaints the ad was offensive and condoned and encouraged harmful discriminatory behaviour. Although banned from TV, both adverts remain easily accessible on the internet. Another advert ahead of the Ryder Cup last year saw UKIP leader Nigel Farage feature in a spoof political broadcast in which he was 'swinging for Europe'. Walsh, 35, has twice won the Grand National before - on Papillon in 2000 and Hedgehunter in 2005.
These rusting 'ghost' ships are the last remnants of what was once the United States' National Defense Reserve Fleet, set to protect and serve in the hour of need. The NDRF was set up in the wake of the Second World War, and at its peak in the 1950s, the fleet consisted of nearly 2,280 ships moored across the United States. But as the need for the fleet has diminished, so has the number of vessels, and today, just over 120 ships remain, posing a risk to the environment in the bays where they are moored. Scroll down for video . Ghost ships: A number of the remaining ships in the United States' National Defense Reserve Fleet lay moored in James River, Virginia . Helping hand: The United States' National Defense Reserve Fleet was set up after the Second World War in 1945, in order to provide back-up in case of war or national emergencies . Diminished: At its height in 1950, the NDRF consisted of 2,277 ships, reduced to 230 by 2007, and 122 in April last year . The ships, jokily known as the 'Mothball Fleet', is so rarely used that many of the ships are falling apart, creating naval graveyards rather than emergency fleets. At its height in 1950, the NDRF consisted of 2,277 ships at eight anchorage sites: James River, Virginia; Beaumont, Texas; Suisun Bay, California; Stony Point, New York; Wilmington, North Carolina; Mobile, Alabama; Astoria, Oregon; and Olympia, Washington. Out of these eight, only James River, Beaumont and Suisun Bay exist today. Long years of neglect and disuse have turned these ships into near wrecks, with flaking paint polluting the waters with heavy metals and hazardous chemicals. The worst affected is the Suisun Bay Reserve Fleet, where less than 50 ships remain. At its peak, in 1952, the bay had 340 ships anchored. Today, less than 50 ships remain, slowly polluting the bay, which is a critical environmental area for fish and wildlife. The federal Maritime Administration has pledged to dismantle the fleet at Suisun Bay, with 25 ships in the worst condition taken out within two years and the remainder to be scrapped by the end of 2017. Reduced: Out of the original eight anchorage sites, only three; James River, Virginia; Beaumont, Texas and Suisun Bay, California remain . Pollution: The worst affected mooring side is Suisun Bay in California where less than 50 ships remain, slowly releasing toxins into the bay . Going, gone: At its peak, in 1952, the Suisun Bay, California site had 340 ships anchored - today, less than 50 ships remain . The federal Maritime Administration has pledged to dismantle the fleet at Suisun Bay, with 25 ships in the worst condition taken out within two years and the remainder to be scrapped by the end of 2017 . The NDRF was established to serve as a reserve of mainly merchant vessels to be activated for national defense and national emergency purposes. The vessels can be activated within 20 days to four months, in order to provide shipping during national emergencies, either military or non-military, such as commercial shipping crises. Throughout its first thirty years, the National Defense Reserve Fleet vessels were activated to help transporting coal and grains in times of shortage, and ships were brought in during the Korean War, the 1961 Berlin crisis and the Vietnam War. After the fall of Saigon in 1975, the National Defense Reserve Fleet was augmented by the Ready Reserve Fleet (RFF) to provide for military emergencies. Since then, ships have been activated to support U.S. troops and transport cargo in the Gulf War in 1990 and aided in several humanitarian disasters in the new millennium. In 2005, four National Defense Reserve Fleet ships were used for relief operations in the aftermath of hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and five years later, six were used in the wake of the devastating earthquake  in Haiti. Its most recent operation took place in the wake of Hurricane Sandy in 2012, when two National Defense Reserve Fleet training vessels were called in. As of April 30, 2014, only 122 vessels are left in the NDRF, and their numbers are reducing still.

A three-bedroom apartment in one of the most expensive areas to live in Britain has been put on the market for just £575,000 - but the 'bargain' property comes with a catch. The Knightsbridge flat, London, which is on sale for a fraction of the price of neighbouring homes, has just three years left on the lease. The cost would work out at £191,000 per year, or £15,000 per month - which is around the going rate for renting a three-bedroom flat in the area. The entrance to the flats in one of the most expensive areas to live in Britain where a three-bedroom apartment has been put on the market for just £575,000 . But if any buyer decides to extend the lease, the property could be worth upwards of £6 million. The 'unmodernised' maisonette in the in exclusive Egerton Place, is described as 'bright and well proportioned' property with 1,990 sq/ft of space. It boasts three bedrooms, two bathrooms, a reception room and utility room along with a lift, parking and a communal garden. The property is being sold by Russell Simpson for £575,000 - the same price as a three-bedroom house in Stanmore, Middlesex. It is one of two maisonettes being sold  with three years remaining on the lease. Both homes will need to be modernised, with the second, larger property - also on Egerton Place - on the market for £595,000. The next cheapest three-bedroom property in Knightsbridge costs £1.5 million, and this flat is only offered with a 28-year lease. But the property comes with a catch, not only is it in dire need of renovation, (such as in one of its bedrooms, pictured)  the home has just three years left on the lease . The cost for £575,000 on a three year lease would work out at £191,000 per year, or £15,000 per month - which is around the going rate for renting a three-bedroom flat in the area, plus renovation works which are needed, such as in the living room (pictured) But if any buyer decides to extend the lease, the 'bright and well proportioned' property with 1,990 sq/ft of space, could be worth upwards of £6 million . Jake Russell, from Russell Simpson, said: 'Properties like this come up once in a blue moon and I think it is an outstanding opportunity. 'To get properties like this in Egerton Place is very exciting and the phone hasn't stopped ringing, which is quite unusual considering the time of the year with the election around the corner. 'We have had interest from locals, developers and end users. In modernised condition, we would estimate they would sell for between £2,750 and £3,000 per sq/ft.' This gives the smaller property a £6 million prices tag, while the larger maisonette with 2,500 sq/ft of space could be worth £7.5 million. The current freeholder is thought to be The Welcome Trust and any buyer would have to negotiate a lease extension with them and, for a 90-year lease, it is likely to cost between £3.35 and £4.5 million. Egerton Place was built off Michael's Grove by John Grover and Son to the designs of architect Mervyn Macartney around 1893. The properties introduced a higher quality of architecture to the Egerton Gardens area with each home featuring four main storeys with basements and garrets, finished in costly two-inch bricks of red and orange. Estate agents said it was rare for properties with such short leases to come on the market and the phone 'hasn't stopped ringing' about the Egerton Place apartment . But Alex Newall, from Hanover Private Office, had a warning to potential buyers: 'It looks cheap, but there will be a massive premium to pay to extend the lease' Leases of all the homes were granted by the Smith's Charity trustees in 1894, and its first occupant was, Sir Evan MacGregor, permanent secretary to the Admiralty. Other residents of high status included the Dowager Lady Lawrence, probably the widow of the first Baron Lawrence, at No. 5, and Sir Henry Fielding Dickens, Q.C., son of the novelist Charles at No. 2. One property consultant said it was very rare for a pair of properties to come onto the market with such short leases. Alex Newall, from Hanover Private Office, said: 'It looks cheap, but there will be a massive premium to pay to extend the lease. 'A developer will probably buy it or someone might use it as a rental for three years and then give it back to the freeholder. 'It is a very quirky situation. Properties do come up with very short leases like this every so often but it is very rare for somewhere like Knightsbridge. 'I know someone who let their lease run down to eight years and they thought 'right, I need to extend it', but by then it was too late and the extension was too much. 'Let it be a warning to check your lease.'
Unleashing your inner Shakespeare could be just a few jolts of electricity away. Researchers in North Carolina claim that zapping the brain with a mild electric current can boost creativity by nearly eight per cent. They tested their theory using a 10-Hertz current on the brain's of 20 volunteers to stimulate the brain's natural alpha wave oscillations. Researchers in North Carolina claim that zapping the brain with a mild electric current can boost creativity by nearly eight per cent . As well as creativity, these oscillations - or the lack of them - are linked with depression. Flavio Frohlich, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of North Carolina said: 'If we could enhance these brain activity patterns, then we could potentially help many people.' Alpha oscillations occur within the frequency range of eight and 12 Hertz 9 (or cycles per second). They were discovered in 1929 by Hans Berger, who invented EEG. Alpha oscillations happen most prominently when we close our eyes and shut out sensory stimuli – things we see, feel, taste, smell, and hear. When alpha oscillations are active, your sensory inputs might be offline as you daydream, meditate, or conjure ideas. When you come fully online, alpha oscillations disappear. Other oscillations at higher frequencies, such as gamma oscillations, take over. An EEG of a naturally occurring alpha oscillation in a human brain. Enhancing these electric oscillations may help treat people with depression, scientists claim . They tested their theory using a 10-Hertz current run through electrodes attached to the scalp on 20 volunteers to stimulate the brain's natural alpha wave oscillations. They then recorded the results using EEG . Knowing this, other researchers began associating alpha oscillations with creativity. Professor Frohlich set out to find evidence. His idea was simple. If he could enhance the rhythmic patterns of alpha oscillations to improve creativity. For the study, Professor Frohlich's team enrolled 20 healthy adults. Researchers placed electrodes on each side of each participant's frontal scalp and a third electrode toward the back of the scalp. An experimental technique used to boost brain performance with electrical pulses can actually cause people to perform less well in some tasks, scientists have found. The technology, known as transcranial direct current stimulation, is already being marketed in commercial products as a way of helping computer game players and athletes improve their focus. However, new research from the University of Oxford suggests that the benefits of this technique, which stimulates activity in the brain with an electrical current, may be limited by personality as it appears to only be helpful to people who are stressed about performing a task. They found that while electrical stimulation helped those who lacked confidence or were anxious about performing a series of sums, it caused those who did not fear mathematics to decline. A follow up study that examined how volunteers fared at spotting which way an arrow was pointing on a screen when confronted with distracting information showed that all those who received stimulation performed more poorly. This way, the 10-Hertz alpha oscillation stimulation for each side of the cortex would be in unison. Each participant underwent two sessions. During one session, researchers used a 10-Hertz sham stimulation for just five minutes. Participants felt a tingle at the start of the five minutes. For the next 25 minutes, each participant continued to take the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking. In one task, each participant was shown a small fraction of an illustration – sometimes just a bent line on a piece of paper. Participants used the line to complete an illustration, and they wrote a title when they finished. In the other session each participant underwent the same protocol, except they were stimulated at 10 Hertz for the entire 30 minutes while doing the Torrance test. The tingling sensation only occurred at the start of the stimulation, ensuring that each participant did not know which session was the control session. Then Frohlich's team compared each participant's creativity score, they found participants scored an average 7.4 percentage points higher than they did during the control sessions. 'That's a pretty big difference when it comes to creativity,' Frohlich said. 'Several participants showed incredible improvements in creativity. It was a very clear effect.' 'We don't know if there are long-term safety concerns,' he said. 'We did a well-controlled, one-time study and found an acute effect.' 'Also, I have strong ethical concerns about cognitive enhancement for healthy adults, just as sports fans might have concerns about athletic enhancement through the use of performance-enhancing drugs.'
Outed on Grindr: Republican lawmaker from North Dakota, Randy Boehning, has an over 10-year history of voting against gay rights. On Monday, he was outed for using gay hook-up app Grindr . A Republican lawmaker in North Dakota with a long record of opposition to pro-gay rights laws was revealed this week to be an active user of gay hook-up app Grindr and claims he was outed as part of a smear campaign by a rival. Randy Boehning, a 52-year-old who's represented Fargo since 2002, sent messages and a photo of his penis to a 21-year-old gay man in Bismark named Dustin Smith. Smith recognized the staunch conservative and took his story, and explicit photo, to the press. But, while admitting he's gay and uses Grindr, the public official claimed his private life was revealed as part of a fellow lawmaker's retaliation for his vote against a bill that would afford protections to gays. Smith told Forum on Monday that he first recognized Boehning, who he knew by the Grindr handle Top Man!, while reading an April 2 article that pictured all the state's House of Representatives members who voted down an anti-discrimination bill. 'Suddenly it dawned on me: I think I've seen this guy on Grindr!' Smith told the Washington Post on Wednesday. Using the 'an all-male location-based social network' on his phone, Smith retrieved the conversation in question in which Boehning, without solicitation, sent a photo of his penis along with one of his face. 'I just felt like this story had to get out,' Smith said. '[He] voted against a bill for the LGBT community and here he was talking to me on Grindr.' Forum ran their story on Monday, in which Boehning both came out and accused an employee at his workplace for exposing him after he exposed himself. 'That's what gay guys do on gay sites, don't they?' Boehning told Forum. 'That's how things happen on Grindr. It's a gay chat site. It's not the first thing you do on that site. That's what we do, exchange pics on the site.' Top Man! Dustin Smith, a 21-year-old gay man who lives in Bismarck, recognized Boehning as Grindr user Top Man! and took his story to the local press . Boehning went on to claim that, prior to his April 2 vote against the anti-discrimination bill, a capitol employee warned him that a fellow lawmaker who supported the bill vowed Boehning would become a target for retaliation should he vote no. However, Boehning has thus far refused to name that lawmaker. Meanwhile, the only openly gay lawmaker in the state's legislature, Rep. Josh Boschee of Fargo, said he never spoke to Boehning about the vote. Boschee claims he's been told of a Republican staffer who's been in contact with Boehning via Grindr since he was last elected and who warned Boehning 'there could be consequences for the hypocrisy of [his] vote.' Boschee also declined to name any names. As for his coming out, Boehning, who says he's also attracted to women, seemed somewhat relieved. 'The 1,000-pound gorilla has been lifted,' he said. 'I have to confront it at some point.' Blackmailed? Boehning claims he was blackmailed by a Capitol employee just before his most recent vote against a gay rights bill. Weeks later, he was outed .
She's a household name, having hosted several TV shows, edited the Australian Women's Weekly, and launched her own wellness website 'Balance by Deborah Hutton'... and now Deborah Hutton has added another accolade to add to her merit - she's  releasing a cook book of favourite recipes that she has compiled over the years. This week Hutton has released 'My Love Affair with Food' in collaboration with the Australian Women's Weekly, featuring over 40 recipes as well as some of her cherished food memories and personal photos. The 53-year-old media personality shared her favourite recipes from the book with Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for recipes . Cooking credit: Media personality Deborah Hutton has added 'cookbook author' to her accolades . Despite having a health and wellbeing website, Hutton has chosen not to buy into the 'diet/health cookbook' trend and is bringing back wholesome cooking and real food recipes that make her happy - salt and carbs inclusive. 'I've always had a love affair with food, I love cooking food, shopping for it and while it's always been a challenge since my  modelling days to both enjoy food but still fit into the clothes I like, I think if you set yourself up for a too strict routine you’ll fall off the wagon at some point,' says Hutton. 'There’s enough health books out there, I'm not about to do one,' she said. 'While it’s good to have your diet cookbooks and no sugar,  these recipes are about the things that make me happy.' And if Hutton's confession that 'a gin and tonic and salty chips' after a day on the golf course is one of the things that makes her happy, the cook book is sure to appeal. Confessed carb lover: Hutton bucks 'health trend' in favour of wholesome food - salt and carbs included . Crisp comfort: The 'Crispy Cheese Ravioli' as featured in 'My Love Affair with Food' Ingredients . Method . 1. Place the egg and breadcrumbs in separate bowls. 2. Half fill a deep-fryer or large saucepan with oil and heat to 190°C (the oil is hot enough when a cube of bread dropped in the oil turns golden in 30 seconds). Dip each ravioli in egg, then toss in the breadcrumbs, to coat. Working in batches of five, fry the ravioli for 1–2 minutes or until golden and crisp. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towel. 3. Meanwhile, heat the pasta sauce in a small saucepan over low heat until hot. Season to taste and stir in chopped basil; transfer to a heatproof serving bowl. 4. Arrange the ravioli on a platter, sprinkle with the extra parsley or basil and serve with the sauce for dipping. Note: If you prefer not to use a cheese filling, any ravioli works just as well. Time: 25 minutes . Serves: 4-6 . This dish makes you look like a star without really trying. I like to quickly cook these after everyone has arrived, so the cheese is still warm and gooey. Just ask your guests to pass the platter. While she is an advocate of juicing, Hutton also believes overall diet trends just don't work. 'I’ve tried just about everything but as a general rule of thumb I don't think fad diets are sustainable, you need a balance. So while I don’t like things  too deep fried or have a sweet tooth, I will take salt and carbohydrates any day, that’s my weakness.' Not to say Hutton isn't a advocate of good health  though. In 2011 she was diagnosed with skin cancer (only two years after her brother had lost the battle to liver cancer) and spent  weeks thereafter in hospital with a face full of stitches. This scare put her life in perspective and now other than a glass or two of wine in the evening, health is her number one priority. Hutton is now an ambassador for the Skin and Cancer Foundation, the founder of Balance by Deborah Hutton - a community website for women 40+ that focuses on sharing health and wellbeing information, and as mentioned, is an avid golfer who regularly spends time on the course. She also confesses that while known for  religiously slip, slop, slapping, in an ironic twist of fate, her doctor recently told her she's now lacking in vitamin D and calcium. Sexy soufflé: Hutton says her banana soufflé is the ultimate date night dessert and is sure to impress . And in Hutton's good humoured nature, she is taking it in her stride and using the news to her foodie advantage. 'When she told me I was highly deficient in both vitamin D and calcium I said - "so basically I get to play out in the sun and eat cheese?" and she said yes, and I laughed and told her I loved her!' In her new cook book, you can expect both 'naughty things' 'and 'really good things'. Ingredients . Method . 1. Cook penne in a large saucepan of boiling well-salted water until just tender; drain, cover to keep warm. 2. Heat oil in the same saucepan over medium heat. Add the garlic, chilli, zucchini and rind. Cook gently for 1-2 minutes or until softened but not browned. 3. Return the hot pasta to the saucepan with the butter and fetta. Toss together and season to taste. Serve topped with parmesan. Note: Remove the seeds from the chillies for a milder flavour. Cooking time:  20 minutes . Serves: 4 . Trust me when I say, that once you’ve had this, you’ll be back for more. There’s something really refreshing about the crunch of the raw zucchini and the zesty lemon. 'You won’t find it heavy in the dessert section or deep fried, or too many ingredients or eight hours of preparation,' she said. 'There is an amazing chocolate panettone in there. I'd only have that maybe once a year, so not often but I had to include it!' Another favourite is the 'Mediterranean Chicken' which she says is not only delicious but a regular on her entertaining menu because it's easy and means 'you’re not strapped to the kitchen while everyone else is having fun.' Day on the green: An avid golfer, Hutton loves nothing more than a gin and hot chips after a day on the course . And at 53, life is only getting better for Hutton. She has a second cook book in the works focusing  on her love of entertaining and she's more invested than ever in inspiring and supporting women via her website Balance by Deborah Hutton. 'Turning 50 I wanted to be the best version of myself and it really is just getting better. Originally I was excited to turn 40 but I love what I’m doing now. I’m invested in this business - I want to help and connect with women and I also want to inspire people to get in the kitchen,' says Hutton . 'Afterall, there’s no time like the present and I’ve never felt more empowered.' Cheers to that: The 'Venice Dusk' cocktail as featured in 'My Love Affair with Food' Ingredients . Method . 1. Cut rind from watermelon; cut flesh into 2cm cubes, place in a ziptop bag; freeze for 1 hour or until ready to use. 2. Half fill a jug with ice cubes, frozen watermelon and mandarin rind. Stir vodka and sugar in a small bowl until sugar dissolves; stir mixture into jug with remaining ingredients. Serve immediately. Note: Aperitifs are made by infusing herbs and/or fruit in alcohol and water; they have a bitter taste and are characterised by their dark red colour. Use an aperitif such as Aperol or Campari. Cooking time:15 minutes + freezing . Makes: 8 cups . Deborah's perfect menu for date night that is sure to impress any guest . Drink one: A Vodka Martini . Entrée:  A dozen freshly shucked oysters . Main: The sexy pea and mint risotto with additional seared scallops on top. Drink two: A Dry Riesling from the Clare Valley . Dessert: The banana soufflé - it's low fat, has no sugar and the presentation makes you look like a killer chef! Fresh off the press: The new book is on sale this week for $14.95 .
The highest-ranking military officer in the United States has apologized to a bereaved military mom after saying the Iraqi city where he died is 'not symbolic in any way'. General Martin Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, sent a letter saying he regretted that he 'added to the grief' of Debbie Lee, whose son Marc was killed in Ramadi on August 2, 2006. The 28-year-old, the first Navy SEAL to die in Iraq, was fatally wounded while providing covering fire from a building in the heavily-contested city. He was awarded the Purple Heart and Silver Star for his bravery. Humbled: General Martin Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, apologized to a military mother for belittling the sacrifice of her slain son . Fallen hero: Marc Lee, right, was killed in Ramadi in August 2006. His mother Debbie, left, was outraged when Dempsey wrote off the city as 'not symbolic in any way' while discussing operations against ISIS . Dempsey had spoken dismissively of the city last week at a briefing when asked how damaging to U.S. and Iraq's military efforts it would be were the city to fall into the hands of ISIS. Responding to a journalist's question, he said: 'The city itself is not symbolic in any way. It hasn’t been declared the caliphate or central to Iraq. 'The issue isn’t brick and mortar. It is about defeating ISIS. I would much rather that Ramadi not fall, but it will not be the end of a campaign.' The remarks outraged Lee, who said she was shaking and reduced to tears to hear the general trivialize the city for which her son had died. In response Lee, from Surprise, Arizona, posted an angry open letter on the website for America's Mighty Warriors, a charity she set up to help servicemen and honor her son. She said: 'I am shaking and tears are flowing down my cheeks as I watch the news and listen to the insensitive, pain-inflicting comments made by you in regards to the fall of Ramadi.' Ramadi was a center of Al-Qaeda operations in 2006, when Petty officer Lee and his comrades were sent in to recapture the city, an effort which ultimately took months and saw some 80 U.S. casualties. Valor: Lee, who was the first Navy SEAL to die in Iraq, was posthumously awarded the Silver Star and Purple Heart . Lee continued: 'My son Marc Lee was the first Navy SEAL who sacrificed his life in Ramadi Iraq Aug 2, 2006. His blood is still in that soil and forever will be. Remember that was when so many of our loved ones were taken from us.' Rounding on Dempsey later in the letter, she wrote: 'You, sir, owe an apology to the families whose loved ones blood was shed in Ramadi. Ramadi matters to us and is very symbolic to us. 'You need to apologize to our troops whose bodies were blown to pieces from IEDs and bullet holes leaving parts and pieces behind, Ramadi matters to them.... You and this administration have minimized that Ramadi could fall, now you are minimizing that it is falling, but you, sir, WILL NOT minimize the sacrifice my son Marc Lee made or any of our brave warriors!' Battle: Lee fell while providing covering fire for his allies in Ramadi. Pictured about are three Iraqi soldiers and a Marine fighting in the city in 2006 . Lee's message was shared widely enough that Dempsey read it, prompting him to send an apology. Dempsey's reply, published Tuesday by Fox News, attempted to justify his remarks by saying he was explaining how the U.S. is engaged with a 'different enemy'. He wrote: 'I've read your letter, and I do apologize if I've added to your grief. 'Marc and so many others died fighting to provide a better future for Iraq. He and those with whom he served did all that their nation asked. 'They won their fight, and nothing will ever diminish their accomplishments nor the honor in which we hold their service. 'We are in a different fight now, with a different enemy, and with a different relationship with the Government of Iraq. 'They must determine the path and pace of this fight. That's what I intended to convey.' Discussing the apology with Fox, Lee termed it 'soft', but said that she does accept it. She was also expecting a phone call from him at some point today. Response: Debbie Lee was sent the above letter from Dempsey after he found her angry open letter to him .
Borussia Dortmund's Nuri Sahin claims Arsenal tried to lure him from the Bundesliga with a 'great bid' but the Turkey international didn't go because his family wanted to stay in Germany. The former Real Madrid and Liverpool midfielder, now back at Dortmund, attracted interest from the Gunners back in 2005 when he was playing in the under 17s. 'Arsenal wanted to sign me with a great bid. My family didn't want me to go England,' he told Ntvspor. Borussia Dortmund's Nuri Sahin claims Arsenal tried to lure him from the Bundesliga with a 'great bid' 'They knew that Dortmund would rise again. I'm grateful for this. After the bid, Dortmund realised that I'm valuable. 'The next year Bert van Marwijk put me in the first team. I was only 16. Also [Jurgen] Klopp trusted me. He is a great person. Now 26, Sahin is back 'home' in Dortmund following an unsuccessful stint at Real that included five months on loan at Anfield during which he failed to settle in and claimed Brendan Rodgers played him out of position. Sahin spent five months on loan at Liverpool (left) while at Real Madrid (right) before returning to Dortmund . Sahin also explained the differences he's experienced between the Bundesliga, La Liga and the Premier League. 'The Bundesliga fans like loyalty. Madrid is a bit different, every player dreams about it. Madrid fans are familiar with success. 'They feel excited only by the El Clasico or the Champions League. Liverpool and Dortmund are different, especially Dortmund.' The lofty heights he's experienced at Dortmund have deserted the proud club this season as they spent the early stages of the campaign at serious risk of relegation, though a resurgence has seen them climb to the relative safety of 10th. They face a tough task on Saturday against the league leaders Bayern Munich before a German Cup quarter-final clash with Hoffenheim on Tuesday.
The parents of a terminally ill boy have fulfilled his dying wish by getting married at his bedside in hospital. Corey Edwards, from Teignmouth, Devon more than anything wanted to see his parents Craig, 28, and Jemma, 21, tie the knot. The five-year-old was diagnosed with a complex congenital heart defect at the age of seven months and since then has undergone eight open-heart operations and other treatments. Jemma and Craig Edwards listen to their wedding vows during their marriage at Bristol Children's Hospital . Corey Edwards' job was to hold the rings for his parents during the marriage ceremony . The five-year-old is suffering from a terminal congenital heart defect and had often asked his parents why they were not married . Corey has been on the paediatric intensive care unit at Bristol Children's Hospital since January and when doctors gave his parents the devastating news that he may not live much longer, Mr and Mrs Edwards decided to get married. They had been engaged for three years but plans to tie the knot were put on hold due to the birth of their daughters, two-year-old Isabelle and six-month-old Caitlyn, and Corey's ill health. When they learnt of their son's wish, they felt there was no time like the present and, with the help of staff and friends made at the hospital, they were able to organise the whole service within 48 hours. They made history when they became the first couple to marry at the hospital but had to get special permission from the Archbishop of Canterbury. The law allows couples to marry in hospital if one of them is desperately ill and that did not apply in this case. But a law dating back to Henry VIII gives the Archbishop of Canterbury special dispensation to allow weddings in hospital for 'pastoral reasons'. Mr Edwards, a council worker, said: 'A couple of weeks ago we were told they didn't think he would go home. We keep hoping that he will but it just looks less likely each day. 'When we knew Corey's wishes, everyone on the paediatric intensive care unit and Ward 32, including staff and friends, got together to help us. The Edwards had been engaged for three years but decided to fast track their wedding when they discovered their son Corey may not live much longer . 'We both planned to get married years ago but decided we wouldn't get married without Corey there, so the only way we could do it was in hospital. 'He's asked quite a few times why we are not married, so we thought we would make it a special day and cheer him up a bit. 'The Bishop of Bristol had to write to the Archbishop of Canterbury to get special permission for us to marry in the hospital and we are so grateful he agreed. 'When we got the go-ahead, we only had a matter of days to plan. We rushed into town to buy a dress and suit and made do with our engagement rings as wedding rings. 'We couldn't believe the generosity of all those involved. One nurse helped to do Jemma's hair, whilst another two members of staff made the cake and iced it. 'Chairs were pulled together to form an aisle and decorations were put up to make it feel like a wedding venue. 'We were married by the hospital's chaplain, Rev Stephen Oram, who was very excited to be sharing this occasion with us. 'However, the most important thing for us was having our son Corey at our side, holding the rings and wearing his suit. 'We couldn't have been more proud of him. We were also incredibly lucky to have our daughters there and the support of so many.' Mr Edwards added: 'It turned into a really, really amazing day and Corey was so proud. He looked very handsome. I think he really enjoyed it, which was the main thing. 'Getting married is usually the bride and groom's special day, which it was, but it's more Corey's special day because he is such a special boy. 'It was nice to share our special day with the people who have helped us enjoy Corey's short life. It has got to the point where there isn't more they can do now, which is obviously very hard. 'Instead of being at his bedside crying the whole time at least on that one day we had a real special day. We know he was happy that day. 'When he's home and well you wouldn't know he is a cardiac patient. He's happy, running around and loves to play.' William Booth, the paediatric intensive care unit matron, said: 'It was a privilege to share Craig and Jemma's special day with their children Corey, Isabelle and Caitlyn, family and friends. 'The whole hospital was abuzz with excitement and one of the nurses made and iced a cake, others brought in flowers and gifts for the newlyweds. 'Lots of the nursing and medical teams involved in Corey's care came in over the Easter break to share this special occasion with them all.' Pictured front from left to right on the wedding day is Corey Edwards and his sisters Isabelle and Caitlyn. Across the back is their mother Jemma, Reverend Stephen Oram and their father Craig Edwards . Rev Oram said: 'Henry VIII gave the then Archbishop of Canterbury this special power to by-pass the law. 'It was that ancient law from several hundred years ago that was enacted allowing Mr and Mrs Edwards to get married. It meant a little bit of paperwork to fill out but we were able to get that done in 48 hours. 'It was very emotional and it was emotional for many reasons. The family and the ward knew how special this was for them and it was fulfilling the wish of a dying child. 'It was also emotional because we knew the outcome for poor Corey isn't going to be a good outcome and everyone was just aware of the specialness of the day for Mr and Mrs Edwards and Corey.' The newlyweds spent their wedding night at their son's bedside and later returned to the Ronald McDonald House where they are staying whilst Corey is in hospital. Mr Edwards said: 'It may not have been the day we had initially planned in our heads but it didn't matter to us. 'To have our son there meant more than anything and it will be a day we will never forget. We can't thank the staff enough for what they have done for us and Corey and we would like them to know how much we appreciate their hard work and dedication.' Jemma and Craig Edwards sign their wedding register and the hospital bedside of their five-year-old son Corey .
A 'halal' sex shop offering 'sensual aids' is set to open in Islam's holiest city, it has been revealed. The shop, which will stock 'Islamically approved' adult items, is due to open in Mecca in Saudi Arabia after the idea was approved by clerics. It is being led by the owner of am existing Dutch Halal sex shop called El Asira, which is known for its range of sensual oils. A halal sex shop is set to open in Islam's holiest city, Mecca, in Saudi Arabia, it has emerged (file picture) Moroccan Muslim Abdelaziz Aouragh revealed how a Saudi Arabian cleric had told him such a venture would encourage 'the improvement of the sexual relationship between husband and wife'. According to the International Business Times, Aouragh would be selling 18 toys classed as being 'Islamically approved'. He is reported as saying: 'Our products do include products that increase feelings of sensuality and improve the atmosphere between the couple in the sexual relationship between them.' The store will 'strictly cater to Muslim customers in Mecca', according to the website Alyaoum24. Moroccan Muslim Abdelaziz Aouragh revealed how a Saudi Arabian cleric had told him the shop, in Mecca (pictured) would encourage 'the improvement of the sexual relationship between husband and wife'. IBS reports that the first halal sex shop in a predominantly Muslim country opened in 2013 in Turkey. Entrepreneur Haluk Murat Demirel opened the country's first online sex shop for Muslims, selling everything from lubricants to herbal aphrodisiacs and offering advice on how to have 'halal' sex. At the time, he said he had been inspired to launch the site by friends who wanted sex advice and products, but found the content on other websites and in specialist stores too explicit.
Over the years I’ve been lucky enough to play with a lot of accomplished women golfers, including two former world No 1's in Lorena Ochoa and Laura Davies. But none of these encounters prepared me for playing 18 holes with Charley Hull, the best teenage golfer in Britain. Suffice to say: I knew she was good but I didn’t appreciate she was so damn good. The venue was Turnberry and a media day for the Ricoh Women’s British Open in July. The sun was shining, Ailsa Craig was shimmering in the distance and Hull put on a shot-making clinic. Charley Hull can make it to the very top of the women's game if she carries on her progression . Teenager Hull possesses the same ‘wow’ factor as world No 1 Rory McIlroy (below) One of the nice things for me about playing golf with the women pros is we usually hit the ball about the same length. Not on this day. Hull hit drives that pitched past mine. She positively exudes the ‘wow’ factor Rory McIlroy had at the same age. Like Rory, she’s also easy company. Normally the way these things work is for the journalist to kick start conversations but Hull asked more questions than I did. She wanted to know everything about the course, from the historic role of the celebrated lighthouse to the war memorial that offers sober reflection to golfers on the back nine. The 19-year-old was keen to know about the revamp planned by the Trump family, who recently purchased Turnberry, under the guidance of course architect Martin Ebert. Again, like Rory, there’s the requisite amount of steel. ‘I’d hit a five iron off this tee to stay short of the bunkers,’ advised her caddy Gary Wildman, on the opening hole. ‘No, I want to hit a driver,’ replied Hull. She hit a driver. Indeed, she hit a driver off every tee, which is the way she likes to do things in practice. ‘I just find taking on the holes makes me concentrate,’ she explained. Again, like Rory, the driver also happens to be the best club in her bag. The 19-year-old has the same mentality and 'wow factor' as world No 1 Rory McIlroy . It puts her in the vanguard of the next revolution set to sweep the women’s game. After the emergence of the Koreans and the revival of the Americans, get set for the power hitters to leave their mark in the same way their male counterparts hold sway in the men’s version. Hull is part of a group that includes Thai rookie Ariya Jutanugarn and American Lexi Thompson. Hull has added 25 yards to her drive since hooking up with swing coach Matt Belsham earlier this year. Again, like McIlroy — there could be a theme here — her swing is so good she uses blade irons (she might be the only woman to do so), which are the preserve of the technically sound. American Lexi Thompson is another highly-touted golfer in women's golf and will challenge Hull . What’s next for the girl from Kettering who plays at Woburn and who finished No 1 in Europe last year, the youngest to do so? She has now earned her privileges to play in America and clearly that is the next proving ground. Her plan is to be the best player in the world at 21 — the year McIlroy reached the summit — which might be a tall order given the present incumbent happens to be 13 months younger and won yet again in America on Sunday. Hull speaks in respectful tones about Lydia Ko. They played together in New Zealand recently, where the home favourite shot a course-record 61 to Hull’s 64. ‘It was just an amazing day, and I hope we have many more,’ said Hull. Hull has ambitions to be the best in the world and she has a good chance of doing just that . The great advantage she will have over Ko going forward is the fact she hits the ball significantly further. But will she hole enough putts to make it count? On this day, she holed nothing of any length and still breezed round the Ailsa Course in 68 strokes. Hull recalled the last time she played Turnberry, in the Health Perception Championship. She was nine at the time, and stood 4ft 7in tall. ‘This was where I got knocked over by the wind,’ she said, standing on the 11th tee. How typical that she got back up to win the event. A decade on, she’ll take some knocking over this July… and beyond.
In four days time, Floyd Mayweather will go head-to-head with Manny Pacquiao in the Fight of the Century at the MGM Grand but he still had time to pose for a picture with Motown legend Gladys Knight.

Real Madrid legend Zinedine Zidane has ruled out the notion of the club selling Gareth Bale to Manchester United this summer. After a scintillating debut campaign in the Spanish capital, Bale has endured a difficult second season at Real - with fans attacking his car after their El Clasico loss at Barcelona last month just the tip of the iceberg. Bale, who joined the Santiago Bernabeu outfit for a world record £86million from Tottenham Hotspur in 2013, has been linked with a move to United in recent weeks with Real reportedly keen on Red Devils' goalkeeper David de Gea. Real Madrid legend Zinedine Zidane insists that Gareth Bale will not joining Manchester United this summer . Zidane (right) says Bale was a big part in Real's success last year and would 'improve any squad in the world' But Zidane, who is in charge of Real's B team, insists that the 25-year-old Wales international will not be returning to the Premier League anytime soon. 'Real Madrid buy the best players in the world. They don't sell them,' Zidane told the Daily Mirror. 'Of course other clubs will be interested in him, he would improve any squad in the world, but the president has said he is not for sale and that is because he is not for sale. 'That will be the answer to Manchester United or any other club that asks the question. 'He was a big part of our success last season especially in the Champions League, and as we look to defend our title I am sure he will play a successful part again.' Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea has been linked with a summer move to Real .
This is the terrifying moment a woman drives the wrong way down a highway and plows into oncoming traffic in an apparent suicide attempt. Jack Rivera, a New York trucker, captured the collision on his dashcam as he drove along the Interstate 35E in Texas last Wednesday. Footage shows the driver of a black SUV, identified as 49-year-old Laura Michelle Mayeaux, coming off at the 397 exit and veering over to the wrong side of the lane. She then steers head-on into a truck which rolls over on its side with debris flying everywhere. As the back end of the 18-wheeler swings out, it pushes a red pickup truck off course. Thick black skid marks can be seen on the tarmac as smoke fills the air. Rivera told waxahachietx.com that once things came to a standstill he got out of his vehicle to see if he could offer any assistance to the parties involved before authorities arrived. The incident, which occurred just past 6pm, shut the highway for around two hours. Mayeaux, from Waco, Texas, was transported to Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas because of the injuries she sustained during the wreck. Caught on camera: This is the terrifying moment an intoxicated motorist drives the wrong way on a highway and plows into oncoming traffic in an apparent suicide attempt . Slow down: Jack Rivera, a New York trucker, captured the collision on his dashcam as he drove along the Interstate 35E in Texas last Wednesday . Off course: Footage shows a black SUV coming off at 397 exit and veering over to the wrong side of the lane . Lt. Ron Turbeville, with the Waxahachie police department, said that she was found 'inebriated' and  'smelling of alcohol' by medics who pulled her from her crushed Chevrolet Suburban. He added: 'Basically, based off that from the attending paramedics and firefighters, there was enough evidence there to suggest that she was drinking. 'That is the reason why we got a warrant for her blood.' After undergoing treatment, Mayeaux apparently admitted to police that she was trying to take her own life. She was released from hospital last Friday. In a puff of smoke: Thick black skid marks can be seen on the tarmac as smoke fills the air . Suicide attempt: Police said the driver in the Chevrolet Suburban SUV, identified as 49-year-old Laura Michelle Mayeaux, later admitted she was trying to take her own life . The incident, which took place just past 6pm, shut down the highway for at least two hours . Paramedics also treated two occupants in the pickup truck and the semi-truck at the scene. It is not known if Mayeaux will face charges and the event remains under investigation. Riveria, who caught the near-fatal crash on his camera, said he remains shaken up by what he saw. He concluded: 'Honestly, I am still a little disturbed by it. 'I have been watching the video quite a bit, wondering why anyone would do something like that.' • For confidential help, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 or click here www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org . • For confidential support on suicide matters in the UK, call the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90, visit a local Samaritans branch or click here www.samaritans.org .
Serafim Todorov, the last man to beat Floyd Mayweather in the boxing ring, now lives on a £370-a-month hand out from the Bulgarian government. The 45-year-old beat Mayweather in the featherweight division semi-finals at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, but his life today couldn't be any further apart from the American's. Mayweather is preparing for one of the biggest fights in boxing history against Manny Pacquiao in Las Vegas on May 2 and is unbeaten in 49 professional fights. Serafim Todorov is the last man to beat Floyd Mayweather, doing so at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta . Todorov (left) lives in a remote town in Bulgaria while Mayweather is one of the richest athletes in the world . Mayweather is unbeaten in 47 professional contests and considered one of boxing's all-time greats . Todorov, meanwhile, lives in an apartment in the remote town of Pazardzhik in southern Bulgaria and shares a Volkswagen Polo with his wife. He told The Sun: 'I live on just a hand out from the state, the money I get from the government is not enough, my family have no jobs. 'It's hard here because it is a small town and there is very little work. 'I get about 500 Euros a month but I have to pay back the bank or loans, I own the apartment I live in but there are still bills to pay. 'I did have a bigger house in my home tow Peshtera, 20km from where I live now but I had to sell because I had no money to get by.' The unbeaten American is regularly seen on social media showing off his piles of cash and jewellery . Todorov (right) is beaten by Somluck Kamsing in the featherweight final at the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games . The semi-final bout ended in controversy as the referee mistakenly raised Mayweather's hand, but Todorov won the bout by one point, leading to protests from the US team. Todorov was beaten by Thai boxer Somluck Kamsing in the Olympic final at Atlanta 1996 and fought just six times professionally. The Bulgarian won five of his bouts between 1998 and 2003, losing once to Toni Naskovski in Macedonia in 1999.
Los Angeles Kings forward Jarret Stoll was arrested on Friday in Las Vegas, Nevada, on drug possession charges, according to reports. Stoll, 32, is the longtime boyfriend of Dancing With The Stars host Erin Andrews, a former ESPN employee who now works as an NFL sideline reporter for Fox Sports. The NHL player was arrested on suspicion of possession of cocaine and MDMA at the Wet Republic pool at the MGM Grand Hotel shortly before 5pm. Stoll was previously in the news for non-sports related reasons back in 2013 when he was rushed to the hospital after having a seizure at his home in Hermosa Beach, California during the offseason, with the Kings later saying they did not know what caused the incident. Scroll down for video . Jarret Stoll, 32 (left), is the longtime boyfriend of Dancing With The Stars host Erin Andrews, 36 (right) Stoll (seen partying at the MGM Grand in 2014 after the Kings Stanley Cup win) was arrested on Friday in Las Vegas, Nevada, on drug possession charges, according to many reports . He was arrested on suspicion of possession of cocaine at the Wet Republic pool at the MGM Grand (above) Stoll, who will make a cameo in the upcoming film version of the popular HBO show Entourage,  was booked into the Clark County Detention Center and was listed as having a hearing on Saturday after posting $5,000 bail. The charges include possession of Class 1, 2, 3 and 4 controlled substances, including cocaine and ecstasy. He was likely at the MGM Grand to attend the two year anniversary of their popular club Hakkasan Friday evening, an event that featured Tiesto and brought out Christina Aguilera. In both 2012 and 2014 Stoll headed to the MGM Grand to celebrate at the end of the hockey season. It seems that Stoll went on a date with Andrews on Thursday night, as she posted a photo of a romantic-looking candle that was seemingly taken at Italian restaurant La Sosta Enoteca in Manhattan Beach, California, on her Instagram page, and a fan snapped a photo with Stoll earlier in the day. The caption, which did not mention Stoll by name, read: 'Always a great date night'. The popular television personality recently spoke about her boyfriend while participating in the Grub Street Diet, a weekly feature in which celebrities keep a diary of what they eat for the week. Andrews posted a photo of a candle that was seemingly taken at Italian restaurant La Sosta Enoteca in Manhattan Beach, California, on her Instagram page on Thursday. That location is four hours from Vegas . Andrews sparked engagement rumors after she posted an Instagram of her wearing a large ring in March . A fan snapped this photo with Stoll on Thursday in California . Stoll had 17 points in 73 games this season and was a member of the Kings' Stanley Cup championship teams in 2012 and 2014. He will become an unrestricted free agent on July 1. The Kings failed to qualify for postseason play after winning the Stanley Cup last year and in 2012. The team said: 'We are aware of police reports out of Clark County, Nevada regarding Jarret Stoll. 'Our organization is concerned and has begun conducting a thorough internal investigation. 'While we continue to actively gather facts, we are withholding further comment at this time.' Veteran had 17 points in 73 games this season and was a member of the Kings' recent Stanley Cup teams . Andrews, 36, sparked engagement rumors after she posted an Instagram of her wearing a very large, square-cut diamond ring last month. Fans thought the picture meant Stoll had proposed, but Andrews said the ring was on loan. 'I've definitely dropped hints here and there,' the Fox broadcaster shared with ABC News in July. 'But we haven't looked at rings... Nothing there yet, the ball's in his court.' She added: 'But no we are fine! We've had enough on our plate for the last two years of dating and haven't really gone there yet.' He was previously engaged to actress and model Rachel Hunter, the former wife of singer Rod Stewart. Stoll broke off their engagement just seven weeks before they were supposed to be married.
The camera on your iPhone could soon help save your life by testing to see if you have cancer in just a few minutes. Scientists have developed a device that clips onto the smartphone and could even eventually be used at home. Their device uses the powerful cameras available now on most smartphones in combination with tiny beads that bind to cancerous cells. Scroll down for video . The graphic above shows how a blood sample can be mixed with microbeads that bind to cancerous cells (labelled A). When these are placed in a clip on module (B) that attaches to a iPhone camera (C) the microbeads produce distinctive diffraction patterns when they clump around a diseased cell (top right) When added to a tissue or blood sample, these microbeads bind to any cancerous cells in the sample, changing the way light passes through it. Using a smartphone app, these images can then be sent to a central computer for analysis and then the result returned in less than 45 minutes. A tissue sample taken from a biopsy or blood from a simple finger prick is mixed with microbeads labelled with specific antibodies. This mixture is then placed on a slide that is inserted into a module that can clip onto the camera of a smartphone. An LED at the back of the module illuminates the sample on the slide and lens in the module magnifies the image, which is then captured using the camera on the phone. The scientists used an iPhone 4S in their tests meaning an 8MP camera is enough. When clumped around a cell, the beads alter the way the light is scattered by the sample. They produce distinctive diffraction patterns in in the image if clumped together. The user can send this image to a central computer for analysis. The researchers claim it can asses 100,000 cells from a single image in around 45 minutes. The researchers say each test costs around £1.20 ($1.80). The scientists behind the device, based at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, say it can even return results within two minutes. They have already tested their device to detect cervical cancer in tissue samples obtained during smear tests. However, they say the system - known as digital diffraction diagnosis or D3 - can be adapted to screen for other types of cancers and they have already begun a trial testing for lymphoma. Professor Ralph Weissleder, a system's biologist at Harvard Medical School who led the work, said it could even be used to help diagnose infectious diseases like HIV, TB and Ebola. Writing in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Professor Weissleder and his colleagues said: 'We envisage that these advances will position D3 as a versatile screening tool for various cancer types (eg cervix, breast ad lymphoma) and infectious diseases (eg Ebola, HIV and tuberculosis) with applications in field work, mobile clinics and home care settings.' The device works by using microbeads that specifically target molecules that sit on the surface of cancer cells. Diseased cells often produce molecules that makes them stand out from healthy tissue and so can be detected by antibodies. The graphic above shows how the new device works with a iPhone to analyse samples for signs of cancer . The images above show how the microbeads (small white circles in bottom images) clump around cells (dotted lines) in samples that were found to be of high risk of cervical cancer (left) low risk (middle) and benign (right) By attaching specific antibodies to the beads, it is possible to make them bind to these molecules, meaning they will gather around a cancerous cell in a tissue or blood sample. The scientists developed a module that can be attached to the camera of an iPhone 4s device . A tissue sample taken from a biopsy or blood from a simple finger prick could be mixed with these labelled microbeads and then placed on a slide. This is then inserted into a module that can be clipped onto the camera of a smartphone. An LED at the back of the module illuminates the sample on the slide and an image is taken by the camera on the phone. The scientists used an iPhone 4S in their tests. When clumped around a cell, the beads alter the way the light passes through the sample by scattering it into distinctive diffraction patterns. This can be detected by a central computer that looks for these distinctive patterns. The researchers say each test costs around £1.20 ($1.80). They tested the device on 25 women whose smear tests suggested they were at risk of cervical cancer. The graphic above shows the internal structure of the diagnosis module that can be attacked to a smartphone . They also used it to detect infection with human papilloma virus, which is thought to cause the cancer. The images above show how the diffraction patterns created by beads and cells change when the beads clump around a cell, highlighting cancerous cells (bottom) compared to a healthy cell (top) They found that their results were between 92% and 100% accurate when compared to the current 'gold standard' diagnostic test. Professor Weissleder said that the prevalence of smartphone technology around the world could bring tests like this to remote areas. He said: 'By taking advantage of the increased penetration of mobile phone technology worldwide, the system should allow the prompt triaging of suspicious or high-risk cases that could help to offset delays caused by limited pathology services in those regions and reduce the need for patients to return for follow-up care, which is often challenging for them. Dr Cesar Castro, a cancer specialist at Massachusets General Hospital, said it could prove invaluable for places like Botswana, where there are less than 10 pathologists in the whole country. He said: 'The global burden of cancer, limited access to prompt pathology services in many regions and emerging cell profiling technologies increase the need for low-cost, portable and rapid diagnostic approaches that can be delivered at the point of care.' Parents can use their smartphone to spot the early stages of retinoblastoma, an aggressive, deadly eye cancer affecting predominantly young children. The cancer, which develops in the retinal cells of the eye, is fast growing and lead to sufferers needing their eye removed. Taking a photo of a child's eye using a flash can highlight signs of a tumour as the cells reflect the light back, making the pupil appear white. The Childhood Eye Cancer Trust launched a campaign last year urging parents to use their smartphones to conduct the test.
Former supermodel Christy Turlington Burns is championing the message 'It's what you do that defines you' for fresh-to-the-UK clothing brand, Lindex. The Scandinavian brand, which opened its first UK store in Westfield Stratford, London, on March 27, has also brought in 22-year-old German model Toni Garrn and Ethiopia-born Liya Kebede, 37. The models have been selected thanks to their work doing good things outside of the fashion world, showing that true beauty comes from what you do as well as how you look. Scroll down for video . Christy Turlington, Liya Kebede and Toni Garrn are the faces of Lindex's Spring 2015 campaign . Lindex opened its first UK store in Westfield Stratford on March 27 . 'I have learned that it’s what you do, how you do it and what you do with what you have that matters,' said the yummy mummy, 46. 'I like that this campaign is providing a platform for each of us women - Toni, Liya and myself - at different stages of our careers who are all doing more with our lives than just modelling. 'I think it’s a positive example to show that none of us are only as we may seem at a glance and that everyone has the capacity to do more.' Lindex wanted models who do good things outside of the fashion world for its campaign, so brought in Christy . Lindex is selling limited-edition #superrolemodel T-shirts to help raise money for Christy's charity, Every Mother Counts, as well as the Liya Kebede Foundation and Plan International's Because I Am A Girl. 'We chose to work with Christy, Liya and Toni as Super Role Models because we believe that the spirit they convey and the example they set will inspire our customers to consider the meaning of beauty – not only on the outside but the inside too,' said Lindex's Johan Hallin. 'The campaign message is that we can all do better.' Lindex is also raising awareness for WaterAid during its campaign with in-store activities and by donating 10 per cent from all sales during shopping events. All profits from the sale of limited-edition #superrolemodel t-shirts, pictured, will go to mum and child charities . Christy, who's gearing up for the London marathon on 26 April, told Red Magazine last week that giving birth has been her toughest physical challenge, but that now she's feeling 'stronger and healthier' than ever. 'Giving birth was probably the most empowering thing I’ve ever done physically. I was like, now I can do anything. I can run a marathon… I can run three marathons!’ Christy - who is mother to daughter Grace, 11, and son Finn, eight, with her husband of 11 years Edward Burns, 47 - had just given birth to Grace in 2003 when she was struck with a postpartum hemorrhage, causing her placenta to become embedded in her uterus wall. She suffered massive blood loss and was forced to undergo a painful procedure whereby the doctors manually tore her placenta free without pain relief - an experience that could easily have killed her had she not been in such good hands. Trauma: Christy, pictured with her husband Edward Burns, 47, had just given birth to Grace in 2010 when she was struck with a postpartum haemorrhage, causing her placenta to become embedded in her uterus wall . As a result of this traumatic experience, Christy founded the charity Every Mother Counts in 2010. ‘What I realised was actually how lucky I had been that so many women don’t even get to choose when they become pregnant.' 'They don’t get to choose whether they will be medicated, or have a natural birth. This is just how it is, and it’s not an ideal way to bring life into the world, I don’t think.' According to the brunette stunner, 98 per cent of pregnancy-related deaths in the developing world are preventable. But, as she points out, the U.S. is one of the eight countries worldwide where maternal deaths are on the rise. Dedicated: According to the brunette stunner, 98 per cent of pregnancy-related deaths in the developing world are preventable - a statistic she's determined to change . Christy, who became famous alongside Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell and Linda Evangelista in the era of the supermodels, now runs marathons in aid of Every Mother Counts. She said she is determined to strengthen the 'sisterhood' between mothers around the world, wherever the happen to be.
Conflicting stance: Ed Miliband, pictured during a speech yesterday, will today announce a 'clear, credible plan' on immigration . Ed Miliband will today claim Labour’s attitude to immigration has ‘changed’ – despite still refusing to put any upper limit on the numbers allowed in. In an audacious move, the Labour leader will insist that he offers a ‘clear, credible and concrete plan on immigration – not false promises’. He will say: ‘We will deal with people’s concerns because we have listened, we have learned and we have changed.’ But, only hours before the key election speech was due to be delivered, his own shadow home secretary refused at least four times to say Labour would put a target on net immigration. Under intense pressure during a home affairs debate on the BBC’s Daily Politics Show, Yvette Cooper would say only she wanted the number to be lower than the current 300,000. Presenter Andrew Neil had pointed out that, in office, Labour had ‘virtually opened the door’ to record migration. During Labour’s 13 years in power, the foreign-born population rocketed by 3.6million. Home Secretary Theresa May, trading blows with Ms Cooper in the debate, said: ‘The choice is clear. Back to a Labour Home Office which they admitted was not fit for purpose, or the Conservatives, who have a plan to reform free movement, cut immigration, defeat extremism and keep cutting crime.’ The Tories are fighting the election on a commitment to reduce net migration to the ‘tens of thousands’. Speaking in the Vale of Glamorgan today, Mr Miliband will claim that Labour would implement a ten-point plan for curbing immigration during its first 100 days in office. It includes recruiting an additional 1,000 border staff, banning recruitment agencies from hiring only from overseas and making it illegal for employers to undercut wages by exploiting workers. However, the Tories are likely to point out that a number of the proposals are already in the process of being implemented. They include the introduction of full exit checks to count people in and out of the country and ‘stopping those who have committed serious crimes coming to Britain’. Mr Miliband is expected to say: ‘David Cameron once promised to cut net immigration to tens of thousands – and told us to kick him out of office if he didn’t deliver. But, only hours before the key election speech was due to be delivered, his own shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper (pictured) refused at least four times to say Labour would put a target on net immigration . Union boss Len McCluskey last night hailed Ed Miliband as Britain’s next prime minister and said the country stood on the ‘brink of change’. The Unite general secretary praised Labour for a series of ‘radical’ policies, including the ‘freeze’ on energy prices, the mansion tax and the 50p income tax rate. And he praised Mr Miliband for planning to repeal ‘some of the worst anti-union’ laws with a commission headed by John Monks, the former TUC general secretary. Addressing a rally of trade unionists in London, Mr McCluskey, whose union is Labour’s biggest donor, said: ‘Our nation stands on the brink of change. ‘In ten days the people will cast their vote. They will pass their judgment on the last five years of Tory coalition, on the Labour Party and on Ed Miliband – as our leader and our next Prime Minister.’ He said Labour offered ‘something different’ and told the audience: ‘Is it radical enough? You judge for yourself.’ Labour would ‘end bogus self-employment and put a stop to the zero-hour contracts that have become a stain on our nation,’ Mr McCluskey added. ‘On tax they’re going to tackle non-doms, a 50p tax rate for those who can afford it, a mansion tax and above all tackling tax avoidance.’ He said David Cameron’s pledge to ‘finish the job’ of deficit reduction were ‘perhaps the scariest words in the English language’. Last week Mr McCluskey was caught boasting that trade unions ‘own’ the Labour Party and its policies. In the Unite magazine he wrote: ‘The Labour Party is our party, we built it, to serve us. These are our policies. They are now within our grasp.’ ‘But net migration rose to 298,000 last year, almost exactly three times higher than he promised. Nothing damages people’s faith in politics more than broken promises like that – or those he is still making today. 'I will only make promises I can keep. I won’t offer false targets or seek to exploit concerns with the politics of fear. Instead, I am offering clear, credible and concrete ways of making a real difference.’ He will add: ‘Immigration is too important an issue for our country to be abandoned by the Prime Minister so it can be exploited by Nigel Farage.’ Last week, David Cameron made a passionate plea to Ukip voters not to risk letting in a Labour government that will allow ‘a return to uncontrolled immigration’. Writing exclusively for the Daily Mail, he said he understood people’s ‘fears and worries’ about immigration. It followed a poll showing six in ten are unhappy with the Government’s record. Mr Cameron wrote: ‘Do you honestly think Ed Miliband cares about controlling immigration? No. ‘He was there the last time, remember, when net immigration increased fivefold.’ Mr Miliband has apologised for the calamitous underestimate of the number of Eastern Europeans who would arrive in Britain when the EU’s border’s expanded eastwards in 2004. But he refuses to accept that unprecedented levels of non-EU migration were a mistake. One ex-Labour adviser notoriously said the party’s aim was to ‘rub the Right’s nose in diversity’. ■ ED Miliband has revealed that a Labour government would legalise humanist weddings. The move could lead to a clamour for other unconventional unions, including Jedi and Druid marriages, to be given the same status as traditional weddings. Mr Miliband told Pink News his government would look to give the controversial ceremonies the same status as religious and civil unions. There was widespread support for humanist marriage across Parliament during the passage of the Equal Marriage Act, including from Labour. ‘We still support the legal recognition of humanist marriages and we’ll review the law,’ said Mr Miliband. The UK’s first pagan wedding took place last month in Scotland.
Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal says he has been dreaming of beating rivals City in Sunday's derby at Old Trafford but will have to do so without Robin van Persie. Van Persie said he was fit to feature in the game against City on Sunday after ankle trouble but Van Gaal has ruled him out. 'Most of the players are fit but being fit for me is different,' Van Gaal said. Robin van Persie will not return to the fray for Manchester United  against Manchester City on Sunday . Louis van Gaal explained at his press conference on Friday that Van Persie is not yet fit enough to play . United players train in the sunshine ahead of their game against local rivals City on Sunday . 'Robin is not fit enough to play.' With City rocking after defeat at Crystal Palace on Monday, Van Gaal and his players have an opportunity to finish as high as second or third  and avoid a Champions League qualifying fixture later in the summer. The United boss wants his side to move towards that target by taking all three points against City. Van Gaal said: ' I dream of it. Every player should dream of the victory. 'Of course I want to win because it's a big step up the table also. If we win then third place is available. Van Gaal watches on as he prepares his side for his first Manchester derby at Old Trafford . Manager Van Gaal (left) oversees the training while captain Wayne Rooney runs with the ball . Goalkeeper David de Gea (left), winger Angel di Maria (centre) and Radamel Falcao were in training action . Rooney leads the way in training as he runs through some cones in the sunshine on Friday in Manchester . (Left to right) Di Maria, Juan Mata, Falcao, Marcos Rojo and Ander Herrera prepare to take on City . 'A few months ago, nobody would have thought about that, apart from me. 'If we win then the position in the table is good as we would then almost certainly be qualified for the top four. And if we are third it's better than the goal we set in pre-season.' Van Gaal acknowledged that City will provide a stern challenge to his team and played down the idea he will be motivated by revenge, after losing the away fixture earlier in the campaign. 'We have lost 1-0, that is my history, the last game,' Van Gaal said. 'I say always in such games, always, you have to control your aggression. 'We did not do that at that time. So I hope we have learned from that moment. I cannot say because we lost that game that we have to win this game. 'In my opinion, you can lose to Man City two times. That is possible.' The United boss also ruled out a potential return for Luke Shaw. Like Van Persie, Van Gaal does not yet consider him fit enough to feature. 'I don’t think Shaw is fit enough to play,' Van Gaal said. 'But I cannot say they are not fit, but in my opinion they are not fit to play. That is a different question.' Luke Shaw is another player yet to be at the standard of match fitness required by Van Gaal . (Left to right) Rooney, Ashley Young, goalkeeper Anders Lindegaard and Michael Carrick have a  breather . Falcao (left) and Antonio Valencia (second right) look in high spirits as they prepare for the derby . Herrera will be hoping to continue the fine form that has seen him become one of United's key players recently . Van Gaal admitted he is looking forward to sampling the derby atmosphere at Old Trafford, as he takes on City with home advantage for the first time since arriving at the club. 'When I see the fans of Man Utd, they are supporting us in a marvellous way, I think,' Van Gaal said. 'After matches, I give our fans a big compliment, not because I have to, because then I wouldn’t say it. I say it because I feel it.'
The relationship between the FA and Premier League — never great at the best of times — has deteriorated further with the ridiculous clash of fixtures on Saturday. Both organisations blame each other for their respective rights holders, Sky and the BBC, scheduling the marquee Chelsea vs Manchester United league match against the FA Cup semi-final between Reading and Arsenal. The Cup game attracted a peak audience of 6.9 million, over treble the 2m rating for the PL game on Sky. But both viewing figures would have been higher had they not coincided. Arsenal's FA Cup semi-final victory over Reading on Saturday clashed with a top Premier League fixture . With star quality including Wayne Rooney and Eden Hazard on show, Manchester United's visit to Chelsea took viewers away from the game at Wembley, bringing the Premier League and FA into another dispute . The FA say that the dates of the semi-final were known at the start of the season, while the Premier League point to the Sky fixtures for the weekend having been set last February — a month before the BBC announced their semi-final schedule. To add to the muddle — with the TV armchair fan the big loser — the Premier League purposely chose to broadcast fixtures involving top-four clubs on semi-final days. They do this because the FA Cup takes precedence and the league postponement means Sky often then have the bonus of a blockbuster live televised midweek game close to the end of the season that could have a bearing on the title race. But Chelsea and Manchester United both being knocked out of the Cup prevented that happening this season. Hazard celebrates the only goal of the game in the Premier League showdown, but viewers missed out . Luke Shaw, who has had weight problems since joining Manchester United, enjoyed one of his better games against Chelsea in a season when he rates his own performances as C minus. Coincidentally, hard-line United boss Louis van Gaal has banned his players from stopping at the permanent fast food van on the road leading to United’s Carrington training base. The van has been a favourite pit stop for United stars, including David Beckham, down the years. But having no choice but to lay off their tempting bacon sarnies could be the making of Shaw, it seems. Luke Shaw was in impressive form at Stamford Bridge, and he might owe his form to a change in diet . Joe Root's football-style celebration of his two wickets in the first Test added some impetus to England’s bowling team, with Root looking more like the next Test captain with every game. But not everyone was impressed, including former Crystal Palace manager Alan Smith, who is following England in the Caribbean and who tweeted his disapproval, adding that he was ‘old school’. But Smith is canny enough that when he sold his cricket agency Arundel, he kept hold of the wealth management business that still looks after a good proportion of the England side. Joe Root celebrates the wicket of Darren Bravo, but his exuberance has been criticised by Alan Smith . Kevin Pietersen is the elephant in the room, even at England’s sleepy Sugar Ridge Hotel on the day after the first Test. Alastair Cook could be seen in a long conversation with Test Match Special’s Jonathan Agnew. It transpired this was a clear-the-air chat between the sensitive pair after Cook was upset with Agnew for being so positive about Pietersen’s World Cup stint with the programme. Quite why this should annoy Cook is hard to understand. Alastair Cook seems unable to get past the continuing rumours about an England return for Kevin Pietersen . Pietersen has expressed a desire to play Test cricket again, and is trying to prove himself at Surrey . Clarke back for more . You might think the ECB’s preposterous president, Giles Clarke, would be keeping his head down after making such a fool of himself at the 2015 Wisden launch by haranguing guest speaker Ehsan Mani and almanack editor Lawrence Booth. Instead he wants ‘Sale’, as he addresses your Sports Agenda columnist in an email, to make clear that he missed the Test in Antigua not because of anything to do with his doomed five-year deal for T20 matches on the island with serial fraudster Allen Stanford, but because he was attending ICC board meetings in Dubai. Giles Clarke attends an ICC Board meeting in Dubai, which was his reason for not being at the Test in Antigua . Ironically, Clarke’s replacement as ECB representative in Antigua was Hampshire chairman Rod Bransgrove, who loathes Clarke. One thing has remained reassuringly constant during all the turbulence of England cricket abroad over the last 16 years — veteran team operations manager Phil Neale always has the best suntan. However, colleagues point out how hard former Worcester captain Neale works when he’s not sunning himself around the pool.
Derry Mathews has won the interim WBA lightweight title after being handed a unanimous points decision over Tony Luis in Liverpool. Mathews saw Richar Abril twice pull out of a fight due to illness to be striped of the belt and just this week replacement Ismael Barroso was forced to pull out after failing to obtain a visa. Derry Mathews celebrates after victory over Tony Luis at Echo Arena on Saturday night . Mathews celebrates with his family after claiming the interim WBA lightweight title . Luis was drafted in at the last minute and while the Canadian will have won a lot of fans with his relentless style, he did not win over the judges and Mathews was handed a 114-112, 114-112, 115-112 decision. Mathews made the brighter start and kept Luis contained behind the jab while landing a decent uppercut at the end of the second round. Mathews throws a right punch during interim WBA lightweight title fight in Liverpool . Luis (right) was drafted in after Richar Abril and Ismael Barroso both pulled out . The Liverpudlian continued to still largely control the fight but Luis showed plenty of aggression himself, coming forward and making life difficult for Mathews, landing a good uppercut of his own at the end of the sixth. Luis' pressure and all-action style was beginning to tell on Mathews, who was more and more often going to the ropes and both men were deducted a point in the eighth, Mathews for a low blow and Luis for use of the head. Luis was in the ascendency in the closing rounds and looked to be pulling some points back on the cards but it was not enough as Mathews was handed a tight decision after a thrilling encounter.
Ben Grower (above), a Labour councillor, refused to deal with a constituent because they supported Ukip, it has been claimed . A Labour councillor refused to deal with a local resident because they supported Ukip, it has been claimed. Pensioner Alan Roberts wrote to Bournemouth Borough Council complaining about a lack of action over fly-tipping. He signed off his email with: 'That's why I'll be voting Ukip'. Ben Grower, leader of the authority's Labour group, responded: 'As you now appear to be a supporter of a racist party please do not send me any further emails as they will be put in my junk mail folder and automatically deleted.' Mr Roberts said he was shocked by the 'petty' reply. The 65-year-old said: 'I am certainly not a racist and I do not think Ukip is racist. 'My comments about regaining our country is in relation to the fact that we are getting more and more laws from the EU.' A formal complaint has been lodged against Mr Grower and the council is investigating. However Mr Grower stood by his comments, saying: 'Ukip is a racist party.' He added that he has nothing to apologise for. 'I don't believe that everyone that votes for UKIP is racist just like I don't believe everyone who votes for Labour is socialist.,' he said. A spokesman from UKIP said: 'This is a serious breach of his [Mr Grower's] responsibility to treat all people from Bournemouth in the same courteous and respectful manner, regardless of their race, colour or political persuasion.' Six years ago Mr Grower was subject to another council investigation after it was found he had used an alias to praise his own work on a local newspaper website. He used the pseudonym 'Omegaman' to publicly big up the part he played in the community. Pensioner Alan Roberts wrote to Bournemouth Borough Council complaining about a lack of action over fly-tipping (stock image above). He signed off his email with: 'That's why I'll be voting Ukip'
The Muslim couple who were abused by a middle-aged woman on a Sydney train are 'hardworking, honest and kind' parents of a little baby boy who moved from Pakistan several years ago seeking a better life in Australia. As NSW police sources told Daily Mail Australia a formal investigation is 'definitely' under way into Wednesday's incident, friends of Hafeez Batthi, 33, and his wife, Khalida, 26 painted a picture of the Islamic couple as 'committed' members of the community in Brisbane. The family regularly attend the Holland Park mosque, community spokesman Ali Kadri said, and they are raising a newborn baby son, Mohammad, in the country which they are grateful to call home. The couple were in Sydney for just a day when they were abused by an unknown woman on an Airport Line train on Wednesday afternoon. Stacey Eden, 23, overheard the ranter insulting the Muslim couple as 'ISIS terrorists' and was recorded on video standing up for the couple. Scroll down for video . Abused on the train: Young parents Hafeez Batthi, 33, and his wife, Khalida, 26, have been described as 'hardworking, honest and kind' by members of the local Islamic community . Not going to take it anymore: Stacey Eden (pictured) made a bold stand in defence of a Muslim couple who faced a racially-charged tirade on a Sydney train on Wednesday afternoon . 'Stacey thanks again for your support for us on that day...I generally believe that you and many other Australian do respect all religions,' Mr Bhatti posted . Now, in an extraordinary act of gratitude, the Brisbane couple's mosque in Holland Park has offered Ms Eden and her partner an all-expenses-paid trip to visit the Gold Coast for a night and to see their mosque. Ms Eden, a blood collector for a pathology company who was born and bred in Sydney's eastern suburbs, said she was planning to consider the 'lovely' offer after the overwhelming wave of international media attention passes. Mr Bhatti told Daily Mail Australia he was shocked by the ugly incident, which occurred on the Airport Line train around 1:40pm on Wednesday. 'She asked my wife why she was wearing a scarf when it was hot outside - when my wife answered her I thought the woman was asking to be friendly,' Mr Bhatti said. 'Then she started saying Muslims like us are trying to conquer Australia and behead everyone here. We were absolutely shocked. 'It was just very disappointing.' Mr Bhatti said another woman nearby supported the racist woman, and the incident caused his family to miss its flight home. 'She said all Muslims should be kicked out of Australia - I tried to calm things down by telling her we love everyone,' Mr Bhatti said. He also said his wife was 'very shaken up' after the incident, to the extent she questioned if it was worth staying in Australia. Hafeez Bhatti, who was racially abused along with his wife on a Sydney train, thanked the woman who stood up for them . Police are urging anyone who witnessed the attack, which was caught on camera, to come forward . 'Stacey thanks again for your support for us on that day...I generally believe that you and many other Australian do respect all religions,' Mr Bhatti said on his Facebook account . 'This sort of thing has happened before, but you try to ignore it and the ignorant people behind it; there are lots of very good people in Australian and only a few bad ones,' he said. 'God bless Stacey Eden who supported us.' Mr Bhatti reached out to Ms Eden on his Facebook page after the story emerged. 'Stacey thanks again for your support for us on that day...I generally believe that you and many other Australian do respect all religions,' Mr Bhatti posted. Ms Eden was scheduled to meet police on Friday afternoon and detectives were attempting to contact Mr and Mrs Bhatti. On Wednesday afternoon, Mr Bhatti vented his frustrations with the attack, when he posted: 'once again, victim of racism by an old Christian lady.' He also discussed the events and said it started after the woman touched his wife's head like she was blessing her, before 'she started her ignorant comments'. Rant: Video shows this woman launching into a fiery spray about Islam, bringing up beheadings and the marriage of children while berating a Muslim woman for wearing a black headscarf . Ms Eden, who recorded a snippet of the conversation, fired back at the woman in defence of the Muslim couple (above): 'Have some respect... What's that got to do with this poor lady?' In her recording of the incident, Ms Eden is heard fuming:  'She wears it (her hijab) for herself, OK!' 'She wears it because she wants to be modest with her body, not because of people like you who are going to sit there and disrespect her.' Ms Eden said she became really upset after the woman allegedly branded 'all Muslims ISIS supporters' and insulted the woman's husband and headscarf. Ms Eden was not having a bar of it. 'That is not her doing it. That is a minority of people. Not a majority of people OK? 'It doesn't matter what they're doing... Have some respect, have some respect,' she said, as the woman continued on her tirade. 'It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. What's that got to do with this poor lady? What's that got to do with her?' 'She was saying some pretty horrible and hurtful things before I spoke up then as soon I started defending them she stopped' The Muslim couple told Stacey Eden (left, right) that they were 'very grateful' for her stand . 'Nothing,' the ranter replied. 'Exactly!' Ms Eden fired back. 'You're the one who started the argument!' the woman said. Ms Eden then instructed the woman to be silent. 'No, you're the one sitting there saying things under your breath, shut your mouth, simple. 'You shut your mouth,' the woman replied. 'No, you shut your mouth. You've got nothing nice to say, don't say anything, simple.' Ms Eden recorded a short snippet of the incident - not the whole alleged tirade - on her phone, ending with the passenger telling her to 'breathe'. She told Daily Mail Australia the Muslim couple and the angry woman alighted the train at Sydney International Airport. Ms Eden told Daily Mail Australia the couple alighted the train at Sydney International Airport . 'I missed my stop because I wanted to stay on and make sure they were OK,' said Ms Eden, who was on her way home to Mascot . 'I missed my stop because I wanted to stay on and make sure they were OK,' said Ms Eden, who was on her way home to Mascot. Ms Eden said the woman was saying 'horrible and hurtful things'. 'She told me if I was in their country I would have been stoned to death because I was wearing a dress. 'I missed my stop because I wanted to stay on and make sure they were OK,' said Ms Eden, who was on her way home to Mascot . 'She was saying a lot of things I just got to the point where I had heard enough.' The Muslim couple were 'very grateful' for her stand, she said. Police and Sydney Trains have not yet received any reports of the incident. The Islamophobia Register Australia group issued a statement praising Ms Eden's actions shortly after Daily Mail Australia's report. 'We are heartened by Stacey's actions - she is a reflection of 'Team Humanity' and we hope that her actions inspire others to stand up against racial or religious vilification,' it said. The group said they were disappointed by the remarks of the woman in the video. 'The sentiments expressed by the woman however sadly form part of the broader false and deeply damaging narrative whereby the criminal actions of groups like Daesh [Islamic State] are extrapolated to all 1.5+ billion Muslims'. The group's founder, Mariam Veiszadeh, told Daily Mail Australia incidents of abuse against Muslim women were becoming increasingly common. ''I'm very conscious of ensuring that I have sufficient storage space on my phone to ensure I will be able to record incidents should I either be the victim in an incident (or a witness),' she said. A hijab-wearing woman told the ABC last month she was subject to a physical and verbal assault on a Sydney train, with a man allegedly shoulder-charging her and hitting her with his bag and leg. Mariam Veiszadeh (pictured), a lawyer and public advocate for the rights of Muslims, says incidents such as these are increasingly common . 'I'm very conscious of ensuring that I have sufficient storage space on my phone to ensure I will be able to record incidents should I either be the victim in an incident (or a witness)' Mariam has been the target of racist attacks herself . 'It was a fully crowded train but nobody said anything. People were just listening. I know they were scared,' Hina said. As for Ms Eden, she told Daily Mail Australia she was already overwhelmed by positive comments she had received online, having posted the video just yesterday. 'Good on you for sticking up for whats right more people should be doing the same,' wrote punter Rachel Lambert. 'Well I don't know you but thank you, thank you for understanding,' said Shahiq Sarkar. Overwhelming response: Ms Eden has been bombarded with positive comments since the video appeared online . 'I hope some day when you need help and are boxed in a corner someone as bright as you is there to support you just like you did for those poor souls. 'We really need to look for the best in people and understand that its a few rotten apples who try to spoil the lot. 'All the best wishes for you.' One comment even asked: 'RU single? Lol'.

After hitting nine past Granada at the weekend, it's safe to say Real Madrid's attacking prowess isn't misfiring at present. And for Real boss Carlo Ancelotti he now faces the enviable dilemma of trying to fit in his array of stars into his starting line-up. However, as Spanish paper AS reports seven players into six spots doesn't go - with one set to be upset at being left out of his preferred 4-3-3 formation.

For the first time since November midfield quartet Isco, Toni Kroos, Luka Modric and James Rodriguez are all fit and available alongside famed 'BBC' triumvirate of Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo. Marca also recognises this issue at the Santiago Bernabeu. Leading with the headline 'Blessed Problem,' the publication states that Ancelotti will have to choose between either Isco or Rodriguez to finalise his best starting line-up. The Madrid-based paper further adds that the latter is the favourite due to his impressive stats in his debut season at Real to date. In all competitions so far, the 23-year-old has scored 12 goals and provided 11 assists in comparison to Isco's five and six. Over in Italy, the fallout at the demise of giants Inter continues with Corriere dello Sport reporting that there is a huge divide between Italian and foreign playing and non-playing staff.

In France, L'Equipe reports that PSG's 3-2 win at Marseille is an indictment at the improvement of Ligue 1 .
The winter of 2014-15 won't be easily forgotten in Boston after the endless snow broke countless records and the city had to pay volunteers $30 an hour to help dig out the battered city. The shere volume of snow that fell earlier this year, nearly 65 inches fell in February alone, means that huge piles of the white stuff still remain. Except the remaining 'snow' isn't very white any more but rather a disgusting black color riddled with trash including broken pieces of glass, plastic shards and goodness knows what else.

To some avid skiers snow is still snow and one in particular couldn't resist the urge to take to the slopes of Boston's temporary new resort. Vlad Tarasov even filmed his journey down the slopes at Boston's largest snow farm located in the city's Seaport District. 'I've been skiing for 20 years, but never like this,' he told The Boston Globe about the 'surreal' experience of climbing the slopes on April 5 and looking down the South Boston urban sprawl. The one-minute video gives viewers a first-person perspective of the experience as Tarasov pushes through the filthy, trash-filled ice pile that served as a dumping ground for the historic winter snowfall. Tarasov recalls having to avoid junk including rusted lawn chairs, parking cones, broken bottles, and 'pretty much every kind of trash you'd ever find on a Boston street.' He hit a dead seagull, he said. 'I've been skiing for 20 years, but never like this,' said Tarasov about the 'surreal' experience . Junk in the filthy snow included rusted lawn chairs, parking cones, broken bottles and even a dead seagull . 'I'm so accustomed to skiing on the white stuff. I was definitely concerned once I climbed the mound about falling on debris,' said Tarasov. He has no plans to repeat his daredevil stunt as the warm weather is now finally melting the snow farm and he doesn't want to have to clean all his gear again. Boston received 108.6 inches of snow - about 9 feet - during this last winter, beating the previous seasonal record of 107.9 inches that was set in 1995-96.

Firefighters were forced to chisel through a brick wall to free a pet cat who became stuck upside down in between a tiny gap in two garages. Grey and white cat Marv somehow managed to get wedged in a five inch gap in between owner Brendon Veale's garage and his neighbours in Hanham, Bristol and was left dangling for two hours. The RSPCA were called and they too were unable to coax the pet from the gap and eventually firefighters had to tunnel through a garage wall with a chisel to get him free. Scroll down for video . Grey and white cat Marv was left hanging for upside for over two hours and the RSPCA were unable to coax him out . Marv was shaken by his ordeal but uninjured and was eventually reunited with Mr Veale's two daughters Tilly and Bella. The rescue unfolded last Wednesday when a neighbour heard miaowing coming from the side of his garage. RSPCA animal welfare officer Simon Coombs tried to free the puss, but he was so tightly wedged in that he couldn't move him, and called Avon Fire and Rescue Service. Firefighters spent half an hour chiselling a breezeblock free from the neighbour's wall, revealing Marv's tail and back legs so Mr Coombs could pull him out backwards. Firefighters were then called and they were forced to chisel through the wall in order to free Marv, who was stuck . After creating a hole in the wall, Marv's tail and back legs were revealed and an RSPCA officer pulled him free . Marv the cat became stuck in a small gap in between two garages next to his owner's house in Hanham, Bristol . He said: 'We don't know how Marv got into the space, it may be that he fell into the gap and struggled to get free only to get himself well and truly stuck. 'As usual, we are immensely grateful to the fire and rescue service for their help, not to mention grateful to the neighbour, whose garage wall came off the worst in this incident! 'It was great to see Marv reunited with his family after this real team effort to free him.' While owner Mr Veale, a mortgage broker, added: 'My neighbour came round to tell me he thought the cat was stuck. 'He was crying out quite a bit and he was too far stuck down to get out, and also upside down, so he couldn't hold on to anything.

I'm in the process of trying to fix the hole in his garage.' 'Marv does like to get into things, but this is definitely the smallest space he's managed to squeeze into.

Violent spectators might not be the only ones to face strict disciplining after Friday night's NRL match, as NRL head's reveal players could also face sanctions for their unacceptable behaviour on the field. Canterbury forwards James Graham and David Klemmer could face point penalties or a temporary game ban for their arguments with a referee during the Good Friday showdown between South Sydney and Canterbury at the ANZ Stadium in Sydney. NRL head of football Todd Greenberg revealed that the match review committee would 'look very closely at' their behaviour, noting that contrary conduct and detrimental conduct requirements will 'form part of the review'. Scroll down for video . David Klemmer and James Graham could face demerit point penalties or a temporary game ban after their argument with referee Gerard Sutton who awarded the Rabbitohs a late penalty at the ANZ Stadium in Sydney on Friday . Klemmer  reacts after being sent to the sin bin for dissent after yelling 'you're off your f****ing face,' at the lead referee . The NRL Judiciary Code of Procedure states that Contrary Conduct refers to 'the misconduct on the part of a Player constituted by behaving in a way that is contrary to the true spirit of the Game' while Detrimental Conduct means 'misconduct on the part of a Player constituted by behaving in a manner which is detrimental to the interests, welfare or image of the NRL'. Both Canterbury forwards could have these charges referred straight to the NRL judiciary, with the highest contrary conduct charge, a grade five, carrying a 525-demerit point penalty and a five-game ban. Graham's charges would relate to his argument with referee Gerard Sutton when he awarded Souths a penalty, after the Bulldogs captain's controversial tackle on Adam Reynolds. Klemmer meanwhile was sin-binned after crowding in on Sutton alongside Graham and yelling 'You're off your f****ing face,' at the lead referee. NRL head of football Todd Greenberg revealed that the match review committee would 'look very closely at' their behaviour, noting that contrary conduct and detrimental conduct requirements will 'form part of the review' 'I don't want to talk specifically about the incidents because they will form part of our match committee review but, in general terms, the behaviour of players on the field is something we will look very closely at,' Greenberg said on Saturday on Triple M. 'Swearing at match officials is not acceptable and I put a full stop on that sentence, because it is really not acceptable. 'I know our match review (committee) will look closely at those incidents. 'There are requirements under the code, things like contrary conduct and detrimental conduct which will all form part of that review and, if there are penalties that need to be imposed, I expect the match review (committee) will discharge their duties accordingly.' It comes as the NRL announced they are determined to come down hard on a worrying trend of increasing dissent towards match officials after a violent end to Friday's game when spectators threw bottles at match officials . The NRL match review committee will be headed up by Michael Buettner along with Brad Clyde, Michael Hodgson and Peter Louis. The NRL introduced new measures last season as to how and when captains could talk to referees. Former Bulldogs chief executive Greenberg again indicated that these would be monitored closely. 'James is the captain so he has the right to talk to him (Sutton) at certain parts during the game, but there were episodes in last night's game that caused me some concern,' Greenberg said. 'And that will form part of the review but it goes to a broader point - match officials need to be held with a much greater level of respect within the game.' Bulldogs CEO Raelene Castle checks on the NRL interchange official who was injured at the end of game. Darren Alchin was taken to hospital with a broken shoulder blade after slipping over in an attempt to avoid a bottle thrown from the stands . Bulldogs fans react towards the match officials at full time  at ANZ Stadium on Friday night in Sydney . Bulldogs fullback Brett Morris will also come under scrutiny from the match review committee after being placed on report for appearing to kick Souths hooker Issac Luke in the head as he scored a try just before halftime at ANZ Stadium. It comes as the NRL announced they are determined to come down hard on a worrying trend of increasing dissent towards match officials after a violent end to Friday's game when spectators threw bottles at the referees. 'The behaviour of players on the field is something we will look very closely at,' Greenberg said on Saturday . Officials had to run from the field for cover and sideline interchange official Darren Alchin was later taken to hospital with a broken shoulder blade after slipping over in an attempt to avoid a bottle thrown from the stands. A police spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia that two people had been identified and their details taken down over the incident, however no charges have been laid. Officers are continuing with their inquiries and are yet to identify how many people were involved in incident. Those found responsible are facing a life time ban from the NRL. Two other men were charged with assault in unrelated incidents following the game, including a 22-year-old male who pushed a young relative to the ground, causing him to hit his face. 'The boy received minor facial injuries and did not require medical treatment. The relative was charged with common assault (domestic related) and given strict bail conditions to appear at Burwood Local Court,' a police statement read. A 38-year-old man was also charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm after knocking down a 21-year-old man outside the stadium. The injured man was taken to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital by paramedics where he was treated for a cut above his eye and his aggressor will appear at Burwood Local Court in April.
David Light, account director at The Data Partnership, revealed the underhand tactics used by his company to coax information from people . Data bosses have been caught boasting to the Mail of the underhand tactics they use to trick homeowners into giving away their secrets. In meetings with our undercover reporters, they admitted ignoring an official no-call list meant to protect the vulnerable. And they said they could never be honest with people about the consequences of passing on personal information because then no one would answer their calls. ‘We’re a business at the end of the day,’ one told the Mail. ‘If we was [sic] to then turn round and say, “You’re now going to get 30 calls from this company, that company”, most of the people will probably say, “I don’t want it”. Because they know it’s going to be a sales call.’ Various firms offered to sell personal information to the Mail’s undercover team using data from lifestyle surveys completed by people who had been cold-called from overseas. They claimed that calling offshore meant they could disregard the official Telephone Preference Service (TPS) – even though the Information Commissioner’s Office said this was not true. Once they get people on the phone, the call centre workers ask them to complete a lifestyle survey. They start with ‘soft’ questions that seem harmless before going into ones about personal finances. While a brief disclaimer is read, bosses admitted victims do not realise answering the questions will lead to dozens of calls from different companies. Scroll down for video . The questions are sponsored by firms looking to target people with specific interests, and answers are sold on. So even if a caller has signed up to the TPS, saying yes to a survey question is seen to override this, giving the companies the green light to cold call them again. An undercover reporter from the Mail met David Light, account director at The Data Partnership (TDP), which has a 60-seater call centre in the Philippines and calls hundreds of thousands in Britain every month. Mr Light's company has a 60-seater call centre in the Philippines and calls hundreds of thousands in Britain every month. He explained that their tactics include starting with warm questions before going more financial . Asked if he thought people doing surveys understood they would get sales calls as a result he said 'generally I don't think some people realise that they're going to get calls' For 8p a record, Mr Light offered to sell the Mail information on people with pensions who had completed a survey as long as four years ago . He said: ‘So at the top you have your typical questions which are nice and easy, warm questions to open up – what is the age of your TV. ‘When you start going more financial – how much you’re earning, would you like a [pension] review – [they say] “no I’m not interested. I don’t want any sales calls. No, I’m going, bye”.’ Mr Light said any answers given before the call ended were taken as confirmation that the caller was happy to be on marketing lists in future. ‘I mean, we’re a business at the end of the day,’ he said. ‘When you try and dig into people’s lifestyles or try to find out information – with all that goes on with credit card fraud and identity theft – people are a little bit reserved to give out certain information.’ So questions about finance were left to later in the call, he explained. Asked if he thought people doing the surveys understood they would get sales calls as a result, he said: ‘If I’m honest, and I’m always honest, generally I think some people don’t realise that they’re going to get calls.’ Mr Light said his firm try to get round the no-call list by ringing mobiles – which few realise can be on the TPS – and by calling from abroad. ‘The problem we’re having now, a lot of it might be on the TPS register. Hence why when we call out offshore,’ he said. ‘Certain companies will say to us, “Can you run it against the TPS file and tell us what you’ve got which is non-TPS?” OK, fine. But the volumes will drop drastically.’ Asked how the firm gets away with calling people registered with the TPS, he said: ‘Because it’s offshore.’ He claimed, wrongly, the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) regulations govern only calls within the UK. For 8p a record, Mr Light offered to sell the Mail information on people with pensions who had completed a survey as long as four years ago. The Data Partnership is run by John Pooley, 38, and his wife Victoria, 35, who claim they are the ‘good guys’ in ‘an industry rife with cowboys’. They started more than a decade ago from a garage in Chelmsford before turning it into a firm with a turnover of more than £2million. A spokesman said: ‘We strongly refute any allegations which suggest TDP is in any way contravening the law or any recognised code of practice. Respondents to our telephone-based surveys are informed from the outset that our surveys are being carried out for marketing purposes. They are not for market research. If respondents “opt-in” they clearly expect to receive calls and be contacted again.’ Data firm Communication Avenue also admitted calling names on the TPS register from call centres in the Philippines, India and South Africa. Account manager Byron Highfield told us: ‘If you’re wanting to sponsor a question then no, we wouldn’t TPS it, because we have their name and they asked if they’re interested in receiving a call back.’ Communication Avenue is owned by Philip and Charlotte Lightfoot and is a rebranding of Phruit, which was suspended by the Direct Marketing Association in 2011 for calling people on the TPS and selling under the guise of research. The Data Partnership has strongly refuted allegations suggesting it is contravening the law or any recognised code of practice . The firm said it does not own offshore call centres but buys survey data from other firms, including The Data Partnership. Mr Lightfoot said: ‘Communication Avenue takes compliance very seriously.’ Steve Eckersley, the ICO’s head of enforcement, said: ‘Organisations cannot get around the law by pretending to conduct market or lifestyle research. Market research should be just that – market research without the intention of passing on people’s details. Using a foreign call centre does not get you out of your commitments to consumers.’ David Light said callers start with 'soft' questions like 'how old is your main TV in you property' Data Partnership’s David Light boasted to a Mail undercover reporter of the tactics used by his firm to coax information from people it cold calls. ‘When you try and dig into people’s lifestyles or try to find out information – with all that goes on with credit card fraud and identity theft – people are a little bit reserved to give out certain information. ‘Like if you was to call me and say, “What’s your household income?”, I don’t wish to answer that. I don’t want to tell you what I’m earning. Because, I don’t know, you could be some lucrative crime gang, know where I live, know I earn over £50k a year, and you think right, well if he’s earning more than £50k a year, he’s probably going to have a nice car, he’s probably going to have some nice valuables in there. ‘So we find that when you get to them sort of questions, we leave them to the bottom of the survey. So at the top you have your typical questions which are nice and easy, warm questions to open up – How old is your main TV in your property? Is it less than one year, one to five years or five years plus? Which newspaper do you read? Do you have Sky through a satellite dish? Yes? OK, when’s your household insurance up for renewal? What month only. So soft questions. ‘When you start going more financial – how much you’re earning, would you like a [pension] review? – [they say] “No I’m not interested. I don’t want any sales calls. No, I’m going, bye”. They put the phone down. So we’ve only got the opt in for them answers what they’ve opted in. ‘If I’m honest, and I’m always honest, generally I think some people don’t realise that they’re going to get calls. I mean, we’re a business at the end of the day. If you go, “You’re going to get 30 calls on the back of this”, you’re going to get a consumer going, “I don’t want to tell you any information”. It’s natural, it’s human nature. ‘If we was to then turn round and say at the end of the survey call, “Right you’re now going to get 30 calls from this company, that company”, most of the people will probably say, “I don’t want it”. ‘Nine times out of ten they’ll probably say, “No I don’t want to be contacted by that company” because they know it’s going to be a sales call.’

What do you get when you cross a mango and a plum? The answer is the latest tropical fruit to go on sale in the UK, nicknamed the ‘plango’. Marks & Spencer is stocking the Bouea macrophylla – or mango plum – after years of work with specialist growers in Thailand. Marks & Spencer is stocking the Bouea macrophylla (pictured) – or mango plum – after years of work with specialist growers in Thailand. It has been nicknamed the plango and it is expected to be a big hit . The fruit has a bright orange edible skin, which is firmer than a plum, and a sweet taste similar to an Alphonso mango but with a softer texture. M&S fruit expert Shazad Rehman said: ‘We know our customers like to try new and interesting fruit and we’re sure this will be something they will really enjoy. ‘It has a soft texture and all the delicious flavour of a mango without any of the hassle to prepare as you can eat the skin.’ The fruit, smaller than a mango, will be on shelves this weekend. It's not the only unusual hybrid on the market. The fruit has a bright orange edible skin and will go on sale at Marks & Spencer from this weekend . The Meyer lemon is a naturally occurring cross between a lemon and a mandarin. The first sweet lemon to be sold commercially in this country can be eaten much like an orange, but it is best used in thin slices – peel, pith and all. The fruit, native to China, was discovered growing by Frank Meyer, an employee of the US Department of Agriculture who was exploring the country at the turn of the last century. The skin is fragrant and thin, while the flesh is a dark yellow and contains up to ten seeds. Other fruits include the Nectacotum, which is part nectarine, apricot and plum, while the boysenberry is a mixture of the blackberry, raspberry and loganberry.
It may not be as fast as a Ferrari or as regal as a Rolls Royce but the most popular type of car in the world is 50 years old this year as the humble hatchback hits its half century. The car shape originally designed to help French farmers transport their sheep to market now accounts for a staggering two in every three cars sold in the UK. And it is just as popular across the world from Munich to Mexico City thanks to its practical design, economy and comfort. The model credited with being the world’s first ever hatchback was the Renault 16 unveiled in April 1965 . The Renault 4: the forerunner to the Renault 16 was first designed to allow French farmers to transport sheep . The model credited with being the world’s first ever hatchback was unveiled to the public with the launch of France’s Renault 16 in April 1965. Now it accounts for a staggering two thirds of all new cars sold in Britain and a majority of those sold in most other markets from Europe to Japan and, increasingly, the US too. In the UK, seven of the top ten sellers last year - including the top five - are classed as hatchbacks. This is defined as a car which has a boot that lifts up from the roof but the outline of the car is no bigger than if it were a standard saloon (so estate cars and 4x4s are not classed as hatchbacks for instance.) Yet when the first one went on sale in 1965, the name hatchback did not even exist. It only came into use in the 70s as an alternative to the American term ‘liftback’ for such cars. The Renault 16 was the first mass produced hatchback in the world. It was described by then Renault president Pierre Dreyfus as a ‘voiture a vivre’ - a car for every aspect of life. Britain’s answer to the pioneering Renault  was the very similar looking, but poorly built, Austin Maxi (pictured) The very popular Austin Mini Metro by Austin Rover was launched in 1980 and then relaunched in 1995 . Like the earlier Renault 4, the boot was hinged to the roof but unlike the R4, the chassis had not been extended to facilitate this. There had been clique luxury cars with a similar boot but the R16 was revolutionary for a mass produced car with a hatch at the back and seats which folded down. And it became the first time cars were called either ‘three door’ or ‘five door.’ The Ford focus the world's best selling nameplate . Not only is the Ford Focus the word's best selling hatchback but also the best selling automobile nameplate in the world. Ford began sales of the Focus to Europe in July 1998 and in North America during 1999. In 2010 Ford decided to reunite both international and North American models by releasing the international Mk3 worldwide. The previous North American version was discontinued, and the new model was launched simultaneously in North America and Europe in early 2011. As of the first half of 2012, the Focus surpassed the Toyota Camri as the world's best-seller . Renault celebrated the car’s 50th anniversary with a retrospective exhibition in Paris this week. It said: “The goal was to design a high-end mid-sized car that would set itself completely apart from the opposition: a family car adapted to every aspect of modern life, boasting the functionality and versatility of an estate while delivering the comfort and elegance of a saloon car.” The car was a critical and commercial success leading to generations of copycat rivals. Better rivals came from Japan - the Nissan Sunny (pictured) along with the Honda Civic and the Toyota Camry . Britain’s answer to it was the very similar looking, but poorly built, Austin Maxi. It was so poor that even the factory workers at the time were reluctant to use their company discount to own one. Better rivals came from Japan - the Nissan Sunny, Honda Civic and the Toyota Camry which became one of the world’s best selling cars of the 70s. The Germans followed with the Opel Kadett, which later became the Vauxhall Astra and the early VW Passat, a forerunner to the massively successful VW Golf. The VW Golf GTI and the Ford Escort XR3i from the golden age of the hatchback as a cult car . Ford brought out its own bestseller, the Fiesta and Fiat launched the Uno. European motorists snapped up hatchbacks by the million. America took longer to get the hatchback bug. Cheap petrol and a love of gas guzzling motors and pick ups meant they were reluctant to change at first. Gradually throughout the 1970s, most major manufacturers began to bring out hatchback versions of existing saloons, like the Ford Escort and Vauxhall Cavalier. The Americans finally followed suit with hatchback versions of their most popular cars including the Mustang and Chevette. Italian manufacturere Fiat launched its hatchback the Uno to challenge European rivals in 1983 . Then in the 80s came the Mini Metro and perhaps the most popular hatchback of all time, the Volkswagen Golf, which is still made to this day. This was also the decade which saw the arrival of the ‘Hot Hatch’ - souped up GTi versions of popular hatchback models including the Golf and Peugeot 205, which became synonymous with yuppies and so-called ‘boy racers.’ Now, hatchbacks are both popular and highly rated. The What Car? Car of the Year for 2015 was a hatchback, the new Skoda Fabia. The Nano: Designed to be the world's cheapest car . Made and Sold in India by Tata the Nano was designed to be the world's cheapest car and released at a price of US$1,600. Tata Motors began development of an affordable car that would appeal to the many Indians who ride motorcycles. The purchase price of the car was brought down by dispensing with most nonessential features. Hatchbacks are incredibly popular in popular in India. The nation's Maruti 800 has sold 2.66 million since 1983. What Car? editor, Jim Holder, said: “At What Car?, we see every day how the popularity of the hatchback both endures and increases. “For a vast majority of buyers the added practicality offered by a hatchback is a necessity, and despite the rise in sales of supposedly more upmarket saloons we see no reason for that trend to change.” Of 2.26 million cars sold in the UK last year, 1.5 million were hatchbacks. Of the top ten best sellers, the top five were hatchbacks - the Fiesta and Focus from Ford, the Corsa and Astra by Vauxhall and the VW Golf. The VW Polo is seventh in the table and the Audi A3 is eighth. The What Car? Car of the Year for 2015 was a hatchback, the new Skoda Fabia (pictured)
Jason Cotterill sent revenge porn to his jilted lover's daughter and threatened to post a sex video on the mother's Facebook page . A mother whose jilted lover sent revenge porn to her 18-year-old daughter has spoken of the 'absolute nightmare' her life became as he bombarded her with abusive messages. Jason Cotterill, 42, plagued his victim with messages over the internet, even threatening to post a sex video of her on her Facebook page. The terrified woman said her life became a living 'hell' when Cotterill, who was jailed last week, sent an explicit photo of her to her own daughter. 'It got so bad I considered suicide,' the mother said. 'If it hadn't have been for some great friends I would have gone through with it.' 'It wasn't nice for my daughter. It was my past - years ago. My kids didn't need to know about that. 'I was trying to move on with my life. It's part of my life I want to totally erase. 'I know I'm not blameless because I shouldn't have slept with him. It was a stupid, stupid thing to do, it was a drunken thing. But it made my life an absolute nightmare.' Cotterill knew his victim from childhood and knew that she had been previously involved in making sex tapes, Birmingham Magistrates' Court heard. He and the victim had attended the same school when they were children but got back in contact through Facebook in 2013. They met up for three dates between January and September 2013 but had sex on just one occasion. The court was told that the mother - a former sex worker - immediately regretted the liaison and told her lover she did not want to see him again. Soon afterwards she began receiving 'creepy' messages from the defendant, saying he loved her and wanted to be with her. As a result, she 'unfriended' him on Facebook and changed her mobile phone number. During the trial the woman told the court he set up 67 different Facebook accounts in an attempt to contact her after she blocked him on the social networking site. The victim said: 'My life was made hell. I became depressed, anxious and scared to leave the house. Cotterill was jailed for 12 weeks and ordered to not contact woman again following a trial at Birmingham Magistrates' Court (pictured) 'He didn't know where I lived but I thought "What if he finds out?" It got me worried to go out, I was constantly looking over my shoulder. I became very depressed, and the fact that he was sending pictures to my daughter was the final straw. 'It was just constant. There was no let-up. He kept sending messages. Some people said "Oh it's only messages", but it consumes your life. 'They say you should delete your Facebook account but it's a way of keeping in touch with my friends and family, especially friends I don't get to see. I blocked him but each time he set up new profiles to get past it... There was no way he was going to stop.' She reported Cotterill to Facebook but the social media site did not take any action, the victim claims. Cotterill, 42, plagued his victim with messages over the internet, including threatening to post a sex video of her on her Facebook page . Eventually the woman told the police about the messages, ending the abuse, but the court case was yet another ordeal. She gave evidence from behind a screen that was just a few yards away from Cotterill, who smirked as she spoke. 'I thought if I didn't go to court he could carry on doing it, so I got the courage from somewhere,' she said. 'I'm happy I did, but it was difficult. This has been going on since August 2013 so it's nice to be believed. 'It feels like a weight's been lifted and hopefully this will be the end of it.' 'I'm happy the police arrested him and brought him to justice. I hope this sends the message out that you can't do this kind of thing. 'I have no idea how I got through it. There was a point where I was going to give in until a very, very good friend of mine said "You cannot let this man do this to you anymore". She was very concerned about my health, my mental stability. 'The Government has made this sort of thing a criminal offence, and that is a good thing. 'But I think about young children and teenagers who are going through a similar nightmare, and it sickens me. There are people out there who are not strong enough to deal with it.' Cotterill, from Oldbury, West Midlands, was jailed for 12 weeks and had previously been found guilty of harassment following a trial. As well as being jailed, he was also banned indefinitely from contacting his victim. District Judge David Robinson said: 'You harassed the complainant over a three-month period and used social networks constantly in a threatening manner to get her to re-engage with you. 'There are a number of aggravating features in this case. 'You sought to use dozens of Facebook profiles to get in touch with her, you also found a link to a pornographic site and made use of that. 'You either involved or threatened to involve others, sending the link to the woman's friends and her sister, insinuating that her children might get to see the photos. 'You used the power you had over her by the knowledge of those photos.'
Photos marking the 50th anniversary of New York City's Landmarks Law look at the devastating architectural losses that led up to the law and how it has helped preserve beautiful old buildings as new construction sprouts up around them. Saving Place, which opens Tuesday at the Museum of the City of New York, highlights what is widely seen as a watershed moment in the city's preservation movement, the 1963 demolition of the old Beaux Arts-style Pennsylvania Station to make way for Madison Square Garden. 'Nobody really believed that a building of such civic importance would be demolished,' said Meenakshi Srinivasan, an architect and chairman of the Landmarks Preservation Commission. 'It really created the coalescing of all factors to come together to save buildings important to New York City's identity.' Scroll down for video . A new exhibition from the Museum of the City of New York shows the former landmarks that were destroyed before they could be preserved by the city's Landmark Law, which turns 50 on Sunday. Above, the beautiful Pennsylvania Station before its 1963 destruction . The loss of the old Penn Station, which was replaced by Madison Square Garden, helped lead to the establishment of a commission that can designate historic places as landmarks and prevent them being demolished . The metal pillars of the old Pennsylvania station stand before bulldozers during its demolition. A new exhibition looks at the lead up to the preservation measures . The ornate sculptures and elaborately designed fixtures of the former Pennsylvania station lie in a heap of rubble to make way for a basketball arena and concert venue . St John's Chapel, which was built in the area now called Soho in 1807, was demolished in 1918 as the city moved to widen the street next to it . The law was signed by Mayor Robert Wagner on April 19, 1965, and upheld by the Supreme Court in 1978 following a campaign led by Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis to save another iconic railroad station — Grand Central. The Landmarks Preservation Commission was given a mandate to preserve buildings and places of cultural, architectural and historical significance. Owners of properties given the designation must get permits from the commission before making restorations, alterations or additions, though some still say that the agency does not have the funds it needs to look at and preserve all worthy sites as the city builds to ease an affordable housing crisis. The Randall Memorial Church (left) in Snug Harbor, Staten Island, fell into disrepair and was demolished by 1952. The Snug Harbor Music Hall (right) and other buildings in area built in the 1890s have been preserved by the city and still stand today . The City Hall Post Office, designed by A B Mullet on City Hall Park, was widely criticized as 'Mullet's monstrosity' after it opened in 1880 and was torn down in the late 1930s . The Ziegfield Theatre, one of early 20th century New York's movie palaces after it was built in 1927 (left), was torn down in 1966 to make way for an office building. The theatre later reopened nearby and still hosts film premiers, but lacks its former distinctive architecture . The TWA Flight Center (pictured in 1978) at John F Kennedy Airport is on the list of historic and culturally significant sites protected by New York City's Landmarks Law. Both its exterior and interior, designed by Eero Saarinen in the 1960s, are preserved . The Pieter Claesen Wyckoff House, which was built in 1652 and is the oldest building in New York state, was designated a historic landmark in 1968, preventing its demolition for street improvements . In its first five years, it designated 300 to 400 buildings, over a dozen historic districts and reviewed 800 applications. Today the commission's work is increasingly bigger. Over the last five years alone, it reviewed nearly 67,000 applications. Famous buildings given such designation include Radio City Music Hall, St. Bartholomew's Church, Federal Hall, Brooklyn Botanic Garden, the New York Stock Exchange, Coney Island's Parachute Jump, and the Alice Austen House on Staten Island. Historic districts such as those in Greenwich Village and Brooklyn Heights make up the majority of the 33,000 properties with landmark status. The NYC Landmarks50 Alliance said there are 1,400 individual landmarks in the five boroughs in addition to interior landmarks and ten scenic landmarks at popular parks. The exhibition traces the trajectory of the preservation movement in New York City, from the end of the 19th century up to the present day. Carnegie Hall in Midtown was opened in 1891 after being financed by 19th century industrialist Andrew Carnegie. It still regularly holds concerts in the present day (right, in 2007) New York City's Landmarks Law has protected a large number of buildings in central and southern Manhattan, though it is also used to protect 19th century homes in Washington Heights (pictured) and historic places in the outer boroughs . The Unisphere in Flushing Meadows Park, Queens, was built for the 1964-1965 World's Fair by the US Steel Corporation as a symbol of world peace. It is protected by the  Landmarks Law . Documents, photos, models and drawings also are used to chronicle the landmarks' development and the losses of important structures in the 1950s and 1960s. Fragments from the destroyed Penn Station and other buildings also are on display. 'The goal of the exhibition is to show the preservation movement in a contemporary slant and its relevance today,' said Donald Albrecht, the museum's curator. Landmarking has never been about freezing the city or making the city into a museum, said Andrew Dolkart, exhibition co-curator and director of the historic preservation program at Columbia University. Rather, as the exhibition shows, preservation allows for both lively new architecture and saving the past for future generations. New York's Grand Central Terminal and its Main Waiting Room was at one point slated to be destroyed to make way for an office building before a campaign by former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis . The statue of George Washington on the steps of Federal Hall faces the facade of the New York Stock Exchange. Both buildings are  protected by the city's Landmarks Law .

Stone Age man ate mushrooms as part of their diet, a study on ancient tooth plaque has revealed. Anthropologists studying the remains of a prehistoric woman nicknamed The Red Lady of El Mirón have found spores of several mushroom species embedded in her teeth. Discovered in an elaborate grave in the El Mirón cave in Cantabria, Spain, the remains are thought to belong to a 35 to 40-year-old woman who was buried around 18,700 years ago. The images above show some of the microscopic fungal spores from grilled fungi (left) and bolete fungi (right) that the researchers found trapped inside the hardened dental plaque on the Red Lady of El Mirón's teeth . The study now provides the oldest evidence yet that mushrooms were eaten by early humans and helps to shed new light on the mysterious Red Lady. Her body was found in 2010 in the cave stained in sparkling red paint and adorned in yellow flowers with an engraved stone nearby. The Red Lady's remains were uncovered in 2010 during excavations of the El Mirón Cave in Cantabria. After discovering a series of individual bones, researchers  unearthed a mandible and tibia that suggested a full skeleton was placed towards the rear of the cave. Radiocarbon dating suggests this burial took place 18,700 years ago and that the female was aged between 35 and 40 when she was entombed. She was 'robust, relatively tall, [and] apparently healthy', explained the researchers , and would have lived in the 'cold, open environment of Oldest Dryas.' Herself and her peers would have used stone tools, needles made from bones and projectile tips fashioned from the antlers of the deer and the cave would have been used for shelter and living quarters. They would have hunted for ibex and red deer, fished for salmon and ate plants, including some seeds and mushrooms. When the remains were first uncovered they were stained with a sparking red material, later found to be red ochre from a haematite crystal. This has since faded. A engraved tombstone was found nearby. The pigment and tombstone has led researchers to speculate she was a person of status or authority and was ritualistically buried in such a way to oversee her subjects. Her robust skeleton, which bore few signs of disease, and her elaborate funeral suggests she may have been of high status or even buried in a sacrificial ritual. Now the research looking at the dental calculus - hardened plaque - has helped to shed some light on her diet. Researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, found her teeth bore the remains of plant pollen, fungi and animals. They found microscopic evidence that the woman had been eating sponge capped, bolete mushrooms and gilled mushrooms from the Agaric group. The researchers also found her teeth bore little signs of decay, suggesting she ate few carbohydrates. Robert Power, who led the research, said: 'These types of microremains show that the individuals at El Mirón consumed a variety of plants from different environments, as well as other foods, including possibly bolete mushrooms. 'This finding at El Mirón Cave could be the earliest indication of human mushroom use or consumption, which until this point has been unidentified in the Palaeolithic.' Agaric muchrooms include the distinctive red and white spotted fly agaric, which is poisonous but also has halucinogenic qualities. However, the group includes many common forms of mushroom that are harmless. Bolete mushrooms include Boletus edulis, which is also called porchini. There is some evidence from neolithic and Bronze Age sites in Piedmont in the Italian Alps that suggest psychotropic mushrooms were used in rituals. The Red Lady's remains were first uncovered in 2010 during excavations of El Mirón Cave, which lies between Santander and Bilbao. This plant fragment was discovered in the hardened plaque on the teeth of the Red Lady of El Mirón . The Red Lady was discovered in the El Mirón Cave in 2000 at a site that has been excavated since 1996 . Haematite comes from the Greek for 'blood' and red ochre (pictured) is often used as a pigment, particularly in cave paintings but the Red Lady was found covered in the substance when her remains were discovered . After discovering a range of individual bones, researchers from the University of New Mexico led by Lawrence Straus, unearthed a mandible and tibia that suggested a full skeleton was placed towards the rear of the cave. When the remains were first uncovered they were stained with a sparking red material, later found to be red ochre from a haematite crystal which as has since faded. Haematite comes from the Greek word for 'blood' and it is often used as a pigment, particularly in cave paintings. It is not known why the Red Lady was painted in this way, and the researchers are unsure whether her body or clothes were covered in the pigment. However, they have speculated it was likely a burial ritual. In Mayan practices, for example, bodies were covered in a similar way using blue pigment to signify they were sacrifices to the gods. The entrance to the El Mirón Cave (above) is located in the mountainous region of eastern Cantabria in Spain . The Red Lady was found in an elaborate grave (pictured) and is thought to have been buried 18,700 years ago . Anthropologists who have studied the Red Lady's remains believe she was buried in a tightly bundled fetal position on her left side with her chest facing the cave wall and her back towards a large stone block . The fact she was buried within in what appears to be living quarters has suggested she was instead a person of status or authority and was buried in such a way to oversee her subjects. A primative tombstone found nearby also hints at this. During the excavation a large rock was found that reportedly fell from the ceiling and had been engraved with straight lines. Among these engravings the researchers spotted a V-shaped motif that they suggest represents a pubic triangle, while another has been speculatively referred to as a schematic hand with fingers. There is some evidence that the people living in the cave at the time ate large amounts of meat from red deer and ibex but there are few signs of what role plants played in their diet. Mr Power and Dr Amanda Henry, whose work is published in the Journal of Archaeological Science, examined samples of the plaque from the Red Lady's teeth in an attempt to learn more about her. They found chemical signitures that indicate she may have eaten seeds, roots and other plants with low levels of starch. The Fly agaric (above) is one of the most easily recognised  gill mushrooms which formed the Red Lady's diet . The researchers also found the remains of pollen from pine trees and spores from the fungi. It is possible the fungi had been used to help flavour food or as a medicine. The Tryolean Iceman 'Otzi' - who lived around 3,000 years ago - was found to be carrying several types of fungi. Writing in the journal, Mr Power and his colleagues said their findings had shed new light on prehistoric diet of the Red Lady. They said: 'The types of microremains show that the individuals at El Mirón consumed a variety of plants, including seeds and underground storage organs, as well as other foods, including possibly bolete mushrooms. 'These findings suggest that plant and plant-like foods were parts of her diet, supplementing staples derived from animal foods.' The cave site of El Mirón is in the Rio Asón valley of Cantabria, Spain. Its opening is around 850ft (260 metres) above sea level and the inside is around 100ft (30 metres) deep, 52ft (16 metres wide). Research has shown that the site was occupied from the Middle Paleolithic 41,000 years ago up to around 1400AD. During the Upper Paleolithic the Magdalenian culture occupied much of western Europe and spanned from as early as 10,000 BC. Magdalenian hunters  lived in caves, but sites have been found that consisted of shelters made from bones and animals skins. They predominantly hunted reindeer and evidence suggests they lived a somewhat nomadic life. In addition to El Mirón, Magdalenian sites have been found from Portugal in the west to as far east as Poland. The El Mirón site has been excavated 1996 as part of the by the El Mirón Prehistoric Project including Lawrence Guy Straus and Manuel González Morales from the Universidad de Cantabria.
Mauricio Pochettino has given Harry Kane his blessing to play in the European Under 21 Championships this summer. Roy Hodgson has confirmed the Tottenham striker will be in Gareth Southgate's squad for the tournament in the Czech Republic this summer, despite making his senior England debut last week. Kane is also set to travel to Australia and Malaysia this summer ahead of the championships. Harry Kane, in action for England against Italy, will play for the U21s at this year's European Championships . Kane made his first start for England against Italy after coming off the bench, and scoring, against Lithuania . Nevertheless, Pochettino has given Kane the green light to participate in the competition despite the striker's workload. 'I think that we have eight very important games ahead and we have time to think about a lot of things that happen in the future. 'Can he play for the Under 21s? Why not? We want to help the national team, the player and we have a very good relationship. We need to share the decision. The first is the player, the FA and us. The 21-year-old frontman scored just minutes into his England debut at Wembley last week . Mauricio Pochettino has given Kane his blessing to play in the European Championships this summer. Kane, pictured in action against Leicester in March, has been hugely impressive for Tottenham this season . But Pochettino insists he will have the final say on whether Kane makes the long-haul post-season trip to Australia and Malaysia. 'He is our player and after if I decide he is in the squad to go to Sydney, it's our decision. But I think we have time to speak in the future about that.' Meanwhile, Hugo Lloris will miss Saturday's clash against Burnley with a gashed knee sustained in the win over Leicester before the international break. Kane, celebrating after he scored against Arsenal in February, will be available to play for the Under 21s .
Islamic State have reportedly launched their own 'health service', bearing remarkable similarities to the publicly funded British health service, the National Health Service (NHS). Known as the Islamic State Health Service (ISHS), even the acronym appears to be an unimaginative copy of the UK's free health system. The video features an Australian pediatrician and an Indian physiologist, urging foreign doctors to travel to Syria and help ISIS with their new health care service. Emerging last night on social media, the video's poster show a cropped image of a doctor, wearing an NHS style blue surgical scrubs, almost identical to images seen on the British healthcare service's leaflets. The video's poster shows a cropped image of a doctor, wearing an NHS style blue surgical scrubs which appear almost identical to images seen on the British healthcare service's leaflets. A stethoscope can be seen hanging around the male doctor's neck and a small microphone appears to be attached to his gown, suggesting the health worker was interviewed. An electrocardiogram and the outline of an x-ray also appear in the western style health service poster. Billed as the 'Islamic State Dewan of Health', the video features an Australian doctor, known as Abu Yusuf al-Australi. It is unclear of his real identity but it is possible he is a convert. Abu Yusuf says: 'My name is Abu Yusuf. I am one of the media team in Raqqa.I made hijrah from Australia to the Islamic State to live under the khilafah. 'I saw this as part of my jihad for Islam, to help the Muslim Ummah (community) in the area that I could which is the medical field.' The video features an Australian doctor, known as Abu Yusuf al-Australi. The doctor is shown monitoring and handling babies in a maternity unit as well as teaching another doctor how to care for the infant patients. One patient is shown being attended to by a Syrian doctor. The video also shows off new medical students being taught how to treat patients. The doctor is shown monitoring and handling babies in a maternity unit as well as teaching another doctor how to care for the infant patients. He says: 'When I got here, I was very happy I made the decision and I was a little bit saddened by how long I delayed it. I wish i had come a lot sooner. 'After being her, it is disappointing to think how many fellow Muslims brothers and sisters in the medical field, who are doctors and nurses, physios, who are still living in the West and are unfortunately the Muslims living here are suffering, not necessary a lack of equipment or medicine but a mainly a lack of qualified medical care.' The video also features an Indian physiologist called Abu Muqatil al-Hindi. The physiologist encourages more doctors to travel to Syria to help the struggling medical service. Abu Yusuf al-Australi is insistent that despite the heavy losses suffered recently by ISIS, the extremist group's medical service is coping well. The Aussie doctor is insistent despite the heavy losses suffered recently by ISIS, the extremist group's medical service is coping well. 'It is a good system that they are running here. Everything is living up to my expectations completely and we really need your help. 'It is not the equipment that we are lacking, it is truly just the staff. Inshallah see you soon.' The video comes at a time when jihadis on social media, most notably British fighter Omar Hussain, has called on European doctors to join Islamic State. British female jihadi Aqsa Mahmood, could also be drafted into working as part of the Islamic State Health Service. The Glasgow born radical, also known as online recruiter Umm Layth, studied radiography at Glasgow Calendonian university. She originally had high hopes of becoming a doctor before she left her family home and traveled to Syria in November 2013. British female jihadi Aqsa Mahmood, come also be drafted into working as part of the Islamic State Health Service. The 20-year-old originally studied radiography at university in Glasgow. Aqsa Mahmood originally had high hopes of becoming a doctor before she left her family home and traveled to Syria in November 2013. The 20-year-old, who was privately educated Craigholme School and Shawlands Academy in Glasgow, is currently believed to be a prominent member of the fearsome al-Khansaa brigade. The al-Khansaa brigade is an all-female militia, mostly foreign female jihadis, who patrol the streets and punish any woman caught committing acts against Islam. However it is likely that with mounting casualties, any jihadi with medical training will be drafted in to work in the ISIS hospitals in Raqqa and Mosul. The new video also comes after nine British medical student reportedly traveled to Syria last month, claiming they were going to help treat the war victims. The students are all believed to be of Sudanese origin and were studying at a medical school in Khartoum, Sudan. The four men and five women reportedly crossed the Turkish-Syrian border last month. Their families traveled to Turkey, desperately attempting to persuade them to come back from the war-torn country. Nine British medical students have travelled to Syria to work in hospitals in Islamic State-held areas.

From left to right: Nada Sami Kader, Mohamed Osama Badri Mohammed and Tasneem Suleyman . ‘They have been cheated, brainwashed. That is what I, and their relatives, think,’ Turkish opposition politician Mehmet Ali Ediboglu said after meeting the families. ‘We all assume that they are in Tel Abyad now, which is under IS control. The conflict out there is fierce, so medical help must be needed.’ He insisted that the students wanted to volunteer in hospitals, adding: ‘Let’s not forget about the fact that they are doctors; they were there to help, not to fight.’ The students were named as Lena Mamoun Abdelgadir, Nada Sami Kader, Rowan Kamal Zine El Abidine, Tasneem Suleyman Huseyin, Ismail Hamdoun, Tamer Ahmed Ebu Sebah, Mohammed Osama Badri Mohammed, Hisham Mohammed Fadlallah and Sami Ahmed Kadir.
A bedlington lurcher named Twiglet suffered a 'serious hallucinogenic episode' after accidentally eating a stash of drugs he found at a village bus stop. Vet Nick Fisher, 31, from Leintwardine, Shropshire, said  Twiglet was left behaving strangely after swallowing the unidentified substance while on a walk near their home last Monday. The four-year-old hound seemed to think he was being chased and had dilated pupils and bloodshot eyes after eating the drugs near the village bus stop. Vet Nick Fisher, 31, from Leintwardine, Shropshire, said his bedlington lurcher Twiglet (pictured) was left behaving strangely after eating the drugs he found at a bus stop while on a walk near their home last Monday . Twiglet seemed to think he was being chased and had dilated pupils and bloodshot eyes after eating the drug . But after 45 minutes of drooling at the mouth uncontrollably, shaking and walking into walls Twiglet seemed back to normal following his 'trip'. Today Mr Fisher, a veterinary surgeon, said: 'We had been taking Twiglet out for a walk as we normally do. 'We went past the bus stop which is just like a seat around an oak tree. 'A few people often hang out there and drop things like food and so on, so the dogs like to go scavenging around that area. 'He came back in the house and lay down and was tired as you might expect. 'But then he got up and started running around, doing laps of the room as if he was being chased. The bus stop in Leintwardine, Shorpshire, where Twiglet found and consumed the unidentified narcotics . After  drooling at the mouth uncontrollably, shaking and walking into walls he seems to be back to normal . 'He had his tail between his legs and his head down, which he only does when he is being chased around by our other dogs. 'When I got hold of him he started shaking uncontrollably, producing huge quantities of saliva and panting excessively. 'He then lost his balance on the laminate flooring and fell onto his side. 'My wife was obviously quite upset. She's never seen a dog go through anything neurological before. Let alone tripping on drugs. 'I just reacted instinctively and had to treat him like any client's dog. I took step back and tried to remain calm.' Because of Twiglet's symptoms Mr Fisher believes his dog may have ingested something hallucinogenic . The father-of-one said he phoned the nurse at his surgery in Ludlow, Shropshire, to come and take a blood sample and made Twiglet vomit. The blood test did not show any obvious medical cause but a veterinary neurologist believed the illness to have been caused by narcotics. He added: 'The next day he was completely back to normal - although his eyes were very red. 'I've got a friend who is a neurologist so I asked them what they thought it was. 'Because of the circumstances and symptoms they suggested it sounded like he'd ingested something hallucinogenic. 'For a dog with no history of having any neurological issues to behave like this for a short period is usually related to drugs. Twiglet's scavenging days would appear to be over following the unfortunate incident last week . 'He would have been quite an unlucky dog to have had all those symptoms and for it to be anything else. 'It's not a common diagnosis around our village but there is a bit of a hippie commune up the road. Maybe something was dropped or had fallen out of someone's pocket. 'I have only seen one similar case in which we found a dog had swallowed a bag of marijuana - we just want other owners to be careful in future.' Wife Karen, 33, a farm consultant, added: 'It led to a 45 minute episode in which Twiglet showed symptoms of being under the influence of narcotics. 'Symptoms include hallucinating, partial seizures, tremors, hyper salivating, in-coordination and collapsing. 'We want to make other owners aware to be vigilant when walking their dogs in the area.' The vet is urging dog owners to be vigilant while walking pets in the area in case a similar incident occurs .
Arrested: Rebecca Grant tried to head-butt a deputy, scratched the police car's with her teeth, bit the upholstery and' threatened to kill the deputies' A Maine woman who was being hauled off to jail is facing even more charges after allegedly tearing apart a police cruiser with her teeth and attempting to head-butt a sheriff's deputy. Police in Limington, Maine, had been responding to reports that an apparently drunk woman was walking in and out of traffic and laying in the road on Saturday afternoon. Rebecca Grant, 40, initially claimed that she had been kidnapped and abused, but when she refused to give the name of her captors, police checked her ID and found that she was out on bail. Once York County sheriff’s deputies learned she had bail conditions not to possess or consume alcohol they went to arrest her, Sheriff William King said. However, at this point, she became violent, and attempted to head-butt a deputy sheriff before 'thrusting her head onto the trunk of his cruiser on two occasions,' Bangor Daily News reports. Once Grant, from Biddeford, had been subdued and placed in the police car, officers found white residue on her teeth. They then discovered a three-inch scratch mark in the paint of the trunk, concluding that she had, in fact, 'bitten' the patrol cruiser. Enroute to York County Jail, Grant bit the upholstery, tearing the material, causing $500 worth of damage. She also attempted to kick out the car window, Sheriff King said. In addition, the 40-year-old allegedly threatened to kill deputies and their families. Grant was charged with violating her bail conditions and criminal mischief for causing $500 in damage to the cruiser. She remained jailed Tuesday on a $200 cash bail at the York County Jail in Alfred. Ms Grant, 40, from Biddeford, was found walking 'drunk' in and out of traffic on a road in Limington, Maine .
Two strange, bright flashes on the surface of dwarf planet Ceres may have different origins, according to new infrared images released by Nasa. The images, captured by the Dawn probe from 28,000 miles (45,000km) away, show that a pair of mysterious spots on the dwarf planet have different thermal properties. The images were revealed as part of the first colour map of Ceres, showing variations in surface materials, and revealing the diverse processes that helped shape it. Scroll down for video . Ceres may appear to be a drab, grey world, but new infrared images suggest there is more to the dwarf planet than first thought. The latest images are the closest taken yet, and suggest that the icy body was likely once fully active. Images taken using blue (440 nanometers), green (550 nanometers) and infrared (920 nanometers) spectral filters were combined to create the map . 'This dwarf planet was not just an inert rock throughout its history. It was active, with processes that resulted in different materials in different regions,' said Chris Russell from the University of California, Los Angeles. The 'alien' spots on the surface, named feature 1 and feature 5, show up in visible light images as bright flashes in comparison to the rest of Ceres's surface. In infrared, region 1 is cooler than rest of surface, but 5 is located in a region that is similar in temperature to surroundings. Last month, scientists said this pair of mysterious bright spots could be towering 'water volcanoes', but they said they need to take a closer look to confirm this. Federico Tosi, who works on Dawn's Visible and Infrared Spectrometer, presented infrared images of the two spots, measuring their thermal properties. 'What we have found is that bright spot number one corresponds to a dark spot in the thermal image,' he said at a press conference today . Captured by the Dawn probe from 28,000 miles (45,000km) away, the images reveal that two mysterious bright flashes on the surface have different thermal properties. The upper trio is Region 1 at visible, infrared and thermal infrared wavelengths. At thermal infrared, the spot is dark - meaning it is colder than its surroundings. The lower trio represent Region 5. In thermal infrared, the spot disappears . Dawn observed Ceres completing one full rotation, which lasted about nine hours. The images show the full range of different crater shapes that can be found at Ceres' surface: from shallow, flattish craters to those with peaks at their centers . Ceres is the closest dwarf planet to the sun and is located in the asteroid belt, making it the only dwarf planet in the inner solar system. Ceres is the smallest of the bodies currently classified as a 'dwarf planet'. Scientists think Ceres may have an ocean and possibly an atmosphere. It lies less than three times as far as Earth from the sun - close enough to feel the warmth of the star allowing ice to melt and reform. The Dawn spacecraft pulled into orbit last  month around the Ceres in the asteroid belt. The probe is currently on the dark side of Ceres and won't emerge until April. There is high interest in the mission because Ceres is one possible destination for human colonisation given its abundance of ice. But feature five, which appears as two separate bright spots next to each other in visible images, didn't show up in the infrared images. 'Spot number five shows no distinct thermal behaviour,' he said. Dawn is currently too far from its target to find out why this is the case, the scientists added. It may be due to having a different structure, or being made from different material. More detail will emerge after the spacecraft begins its first intensive science phase on April 23, from a distance of 8,400 miles (13,500km) from the surface, said Martin Hoffmann, investigator on the Dawn camera team. The origins of Ceres' bright spots, which have captivated the attention of scientists and the public alike, remain unknown. 'The bright spots continue to fascinate the science team, but we will have to wait until we get closer and are able to resolve them before we can determine their source,' Russell said. Recent images from the Dawn spacecraft reveal feature 5 at various angles as the asteroid rotates. The glimmers of light are visible even when they are near the edge of Ceres, suggesting that they must be high above the surface rather than at the bottom of an impact crater, as previously believed. 'What is amazing is that you can see the feature while the rim is still in the line of sight,' said Andreas Nathues, a planetary scientist at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research in Göttingen, Germany. Ceres rotates in this sped-up movie comprised of images taken by Nasa's Dawn mission during its approach to the dwarf planet. The glimmers of light are visible even when they are near the edge of Ceres, suggesting that are on a high elevation in relation to the rest of the surface . The 'alien' mark can be clearly seen in images the icy world as the Dawn probe hurtled its way towards a rendezvous on March 6 . He noted that at dawn on Ceres, the spots shine brightly, but fade as dusk draws in. According to Nature, this could mean sunlight plays an important role in the formation of the features by, for instance, heating up ice just beneath the surface and causing it blast of in a plume. Scientists have speculated that the interior of Ceres is rocky with a layer of water and ice. The leading theory now for the alien spots is that the ice is covered by a thin layer of soil that at times forms into huge 'cryovolcanoes' due to internal pressure in the asteroid. Ceres is 590 miles (950 km) across and was discovered in 1801. In January, researchers discovered that water was gushing from its surface at a rate of 13lb (6kg) per second. 'Now, finally, we have a spacecraft on the verge of unveiling this mysterious, alien world,' Dawn mission director and chief engineer Marc Rayman, of Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California said. 'Soon it will reveal myriad secrets Ceres has held since the dawn of the solar system.' Ceres is the bright spot in the centre of the image. Because the dwarf planet is much brighter than the stars in the background, the camera team selected a long exposure time to make the stars visible. The long exposure made Ceres appear overexposed, and exaggerated its size A cropped, magnified view of Ceres appears in the inset image at lower left . Dawn will be captured into Ceres' orbit in March, marking the first visit to a dwarf planet by a spacecraft (artist's impression pictured) Ceres orbits the sun in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter and is very similar to Jupiter's moon Europa and Saturn's moon Enceladus - both considered potential sources for harbouring life. The presence and abundance of water in bodies like Ceres could have relevance for the origin of life on Earth and the large-scale migration of planets such as Jupiter. One scenario suggests as the giant planets migrated they disturbed populations of small rocky and icy asteroids and comets which hit the early Earth and Moon - delivering organic molecules and water to Earth. Ceres is twice the size of Saturn's geyser-spouting moon Enceladus which is suspected of having liquid water beneath its surface. It lies less than three times as far as Earth from the sun - close enough to feel the warmth of the star allowing ice to melt and reform. Since launching in 2007, Dawn has already visited Vesta, a giant protoplanet currently located 104 million miles (168 million km) away from Ceres. The distance between Vesta and Ceres is greater than the distance between the Earth and the sun. During its 14 months in orbit around Vesta, the spacecraft delivered unprecedented scientific insights, including images of its cratered surface and important clues about its geological history. Vesta and Ceres are the two most massive bodies in the main asteroid belt. Ceres is 590 miles (950 km) across and was discovered in 1801. In January, researchers discovered that water was gushing from its surface .
Heavy-duty: The drill that was used by thieves during the brazen £60million Hatton Garden heist . This is the drill that was used by thieves during the £60million Hatton Garden heist over the Easter weekend. The gang used the power tool to cut through the  wall of the secured vault where they raided 72 security boxes before escaping with wheelie bins full of precious gems. The photograph of the Hilti DD350 drill was released tonight by Scotland Yard  as the officer in charge of the investigation said the crime had been carried out by an 'Ocean's 11 type team'. Police are offering a £20,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those involved in the raid. The six men were captured on CCTV as they carried out the bold raid in London's diamond district. They used the drill to cut through a concrete wall into the bank's strongroom, where they ransacked security vaults. But, amazingly, the hole used by the gang was just 45cm wide and 25cm high - meaning they would have had something of a squeeze to muscle their way into the basement. Images of the scene show the mayhem that detectives discovered when they arrived at the crime scene in London's diamond district. Safety deposit boxes were strewn across the floor while power tools - including the heavy duty Hilti DD350 used to access the vaults - were discarded nearby. Scotland Yard also described how there was rubbish covering the Hatton Garden basement, while the wrought-iron cage door had been broken down. An angle grinder, concrete drills and crowbars were found amid the security boxes. Officers said there was no sign of forced entry to the outside of the building, indicating that they had a key or that someone had let them in from the inside. One of the theories behind the  heist is that a member of the gang had rented a space within the premises. The Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Company is housed in a seven-storey building, which accommodates 60 other businesses, including watch traders and diamond wholesalers. The thieves appeared to have disabled the communal lift on the second floor, before using the lift shaft - which was destroyed when police officers arrived at the scene - to climb down to the vault. Breaking in: The gang used the power tool to cut through the concrete wall of the secured vault, pictured . Caught on CCTV: Scotland Yard previously released several images of the gang as they entered the premises . Reward: Police are offering a £20k reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the criminal . Unaware: The men had their faces covered, but sources have suggested they were not aware of the camera . They then opened shutter doors into the basement, before boring holes into the basement wall. Appearing on the BBC's Crimewatch tonight, Detective Superintendent Craig Turner, head of the Flying Squad, said that the theft had been carried out by an 'almost Ocean's 11 type team'. Mr Turner said: 'This was a particularly ambitious burglary to say the least and has affected so many victims. 'People's property has been taken, people's pensions, people's heirlooms which obviously can't be replaced by insurance firms. 'We may well be misled - this is carried out by an almost Ocean's 11 type team, but in essence there are victims behind this and these are callous thieves.' Destruction: Dramatic pictures released yesterday show the scenes of chaos found by detectives when they arrived at the crime scene in London, where burglars had strewn safety deposit boxes across the floor . Covered in dust and debris: Left, the forced door to the vault and, right, the mess left in the corridor . Inside knowledge: The gang managed to access the security boxes without damaging the vault door, pictured . Carefully planned: Officers said there was no sign of forced entry to the building and that the thieves had disabled the communal lift on the second floor and then used the lift shaft (pictured) to climb down . Peter Kirkham, a former DCI with the Met Police who worked for the Flying Squad for five years in the mid-90s, said police photos of the scene supported his belief that the  heist was an inside job. Another former Flying Squad detective said: 'Everything you see indicates a very specialist knowledge both in what was inside the building and how to deal with it. Thursday, April 2: Workers from businesses in the building go home for long Easter weekend. Some have claimed the thieves were already hiding inside the building waiting to be locked in. Friday, April 3: Police have found no signs of forced entry at the premises, but an intruder alarm sounded at the safety deposit business in the basement at 00:21. No police car was sent. Traders have claimed a security guard attended the site but said he 'wasn't paid enough' to look inside the vaults. Saturday, April 4, Sunday April 5 and Monday, April 6: The exact time of the raid has not been confirmed, but given the amount of time it would have taken to drill through the concrete wall and opened 70 safety deposit boxes, it is thought to have taken many hours. Tuesday, April 7: At 8am, workers return to the building and finding 'scenes of chaos'. They call the police, who attend. 'There is an expertise, combined with strength, patience, determination and, probably, an inside knowledge.' Releasing the scene images yesterday, Scotland Yard said forensics had finished examining the scene and that it had taken a 'significant amount of time'. The force said the team had recorded, packaged and recovered approximately 400 exhibits, including items for DNA profiling, fingerprints and other evidence. Specialist forensic photographers have also mapped out the crime scene and utilised digital techniques to record the inside of the premises, it said. Speaking tonight, Mr Turner appealed for members of the public who may have been in the Hatton Garden area during the theft and who may have seen anything suspicious to come forward. Describing the drill that had been found at the scene as a 'specialised bit of equipment', he called for members of the criminal community who may have seen the gang in possession of it to get in touch. There are still six victims who have not been identified yet by police, Mr Turner said. 'I appeal to any of those victims who haven't been contacted by police to contact the incident room,' he added. The police previously released CCTV footage showing the suspects believed to be involved in the heist . The picture showed three suspects, using a side door to the building, as well as a van used by the gang .
Carla Suarez Navarro advanced to the final of the Miami Open after topping Andrea Petkovic 6-3, 6-3 in a semi-final  on Thursday. The  Spaniard 12th-seed didn't face a single break point and will meet either top seed Serena Williams or third seed Simona Halep in Saturday's final. It's the eighth time that Suarez Navarro has reached a WTA final. She's looking for her second title. Carla Suarez Navarro celebrates after match point in her match against Andrea Petkovic on Thursday . Suarez Navarro will play either Simona Halep or Serena Williams in the final of the Miami Open . Petkovic, the No 9 seed from Germany, lost to Suarez Navarro for the third time in five meetings. Petkovic had not dropped a set in any of her first four matches this year at Key Biscayne. Suarez Navarro took control of the opening set with an early break, then broke Petkovic again when the German's forehand sailed well long to end the set. And in the second, Suarez Navarro broke yet again for a 4-2 lead and finished it off not long afterward. Suarez Navarro had been pushed to three-setters in each of her previous two matches. She threw her fists in the air and smacked a ball into the stands with joy when Petkovic's final shot sailed wide. Williams and Halep - the last woman to beat the world's No 1 - were set to play Thursday night to determine the other finalist. The schedule Thursday includes a pair of men's quarterfinal matches, with fourth-seeded Kei Nishikori of Japan facing 22nd-seed John Isner of the United States in the afternoon - the first head-to-head matchup between those two - and No. 1 Novak Djokovic of Serbia meeting No. 6 David Ferrer of Spain in the evening. The Spaniard hits a forehand on her way to a 6-3, 6-3 victory at Crandon park Tennis Center . Petkovic shows her frustration during the semi-final match on Thursday .
David Cameron this morning launched a furious attack on Labour MPs 'bleating' about poverty after it emerged more than a million people turned to food banks last year. The Prime Minister said Labour had left millions of people trapped on welfare in a system which 'punished the poor'. He accused Ed Miliband and Ed Balls of having 'some brass neck' by attacking the Tories for failing the poor, adding: 'Don't you dare lecture us on poverty.' Scroll down for video . The Prime Minister, delivering a major speech on the economy in Bedford today, said Labour had left millions of people trapped on welfare in a system which 'punished the poor' Mr Cameron, in a major speech on the economy this morning, said the Tories were overhauling the benefit system, increasing the minimum wage and providing more free child care to help parents get to work. He added: ‘True compassion isn’t giving people a benefits cheque – it’s giving them a chance.’ He said Labour had left a system where a single mum, working 15 hours and earning £87 a week, would have actually lost money if she had taken on any more work. Mr Cameron said families stuck on benefits were not ‘playing the system’ but were ‘victims of it’. He said they were ‘victims of a welfare trap laid by Labour, paid for by hardworking taxpayers’. The PM added: That destroyed aspiration. It created resentment. And it was never meant to be this way. Welfare was meant to be a safety net – not a web from which no-one could escape. ‘So when I hear Labour politicians bleating on about the same old Tories, not on the side of working people, I just think: some brass neck. ‘It was you who trapped the poor on welfare and widened inequality. Yes, you Ed Miliband and Ed Balls who designed these systems that punished the lowest paid. So don’t you dare lecture us on poverty. ‘And know this – the true party of working people in Britain today is us, the Conservative Party.’ Mr Cameron accused Ed Miliband and Ed Balls of having 'some brass neck' by attacking the Tories for failing the poor, adding: 'Don't you dare lecture us on poverty.' Mr Cameron promised extra free childcare for 600,000 children a year to counter spiralling costs and said the expense of nurseries and childminders has become a major barrier to employment. The Conservatives have pledged to reduce tax relief on pension contributions for people earning more than £150,000 to fund additional free childcare places. ‘For many second earners, work didn’t pay because the cost of childcare was so high. So we introduced 15 hours of free childcare a week for three- and four-year-olds and disadvantaged two-year-olds. ‘In the next Parliament we will double that for three- and four-year-olds. That’ s right – 30 hours of free childcare a week – worth £5,000 to working families. ‘That means over 600,000 extra free childcare places available for families every year – nine million extra hours of childcare a week and parents able to work an extra 78 days a year without any childcare costs – all by 2017.’ Mr Cameron also argued ‘that true compassion isn’t giving people a benefits cheque – it’s giving them a chance’. The new free childcare will be available where all parents in the household are working at least eight hours a week at the minimum wage. The new 30 hours entitlement will cost just under £350 million a year.
German legend Franz Beckenbauer has accused Bayern Munich stars of playing as if they had taken 'sleeping pills' in their midweek defeat by Porto. The Bundesliga champions conceded twice in the opening 10minutes before losing 3-1 to the Portuguese in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final on Wednesday. Der Kaiser may be a brand ambassador for the club but he couldn't hide his feelings after the game, when he criticised defender Dante for playing as if he were wearing 'ski boots' before turning on the entire team.

Ricardo Quaresma scored the opening goal from the spot in Porto's 3-1 defeat of the Germans . Beckenbauer accused Brazilian defender Dante (left) of playing as if he were wearing 'ski boots' Speaking to reporters in New York to mark the club's new media agreement with MSN, Beckenbauer said: 'It was one of those days, all the players didn't show their real performance. 'After 10 minutes you are 2-0 down in the quarter-final in the Champions League, so many mistakes. I never saw this before. I thought they took sleeping pills! Porto were much faster, real power. It made me angry. Quaresma celebrates with Porto team-mates after netting his second goal inside the first 10minutes . Bayern Munich head coach Pep Guardiola goes crazy at his team's performance . Bayern players trudge off after defeat knowing they will have to vastly improve to reach the semi-finals . 'If they played like that again, no chance [they can go through]. But they can win 2-0 or go to extra-time. They have a chance. Last year we had the same problem, playing excellent in the Bundesliga and then we had two bad days and were out of the competition.' The 69-year-old did attempt to play down his comments over Dante's performance, he said: 'At half-time, I have to give a comment and that was my reaction. And I'm sorry to give him the ski boots... but he's Brazilian, and Brazilian to me means for me, technique and Pele and... Brazil. But not this.' 'If you want to win the Champions League you need a strong league with a lot of players. Internationally, Bayern Munich belongs to the top teams but to win the Champions League… you saw the game probably two days ago, we are far, far away. With this performance, you don't win anything,' he added.
Boris Johnson was accused of ‘breath-taking cheek’ after he set out his vision of ‘moral purpose’ in business and politics. The London Mayor praised the Coalition for having kept down unemployment and not returning to the dole queues of 1980s Britain. He said the fact that more jobs were being created was ‘one of the absolute moral triumphs’ of the government. Boris Johnson, who is standing to be a Tory MP in a west London constituency, has set out his vision of ‘moral purpose’ in business and politics . The comments by Mr Johnson, who is standing to be a Tory MP in a west London constituency, will be seen as an attempt to position himself as a future party leader. Labour’s Stephen Pound accused the London Mayor of 'breath-taking cheek' Last night Labour’s Stephen Pound, who is fighting to defend a nearby seat, said: ‘I’m thinking of a sentence with the words pot, kettle and black in it.’ ‘It seems that Boris’s motto is “do as I say, not as I do”. It really is breath-taking cheek. He obviously has a different definition of “moral” to most of my constituents.’ In 2004, Mr Johnson admitted a four-year affair with the journalist Petronella Wyatt while he was married to his second wife Marina, with whom he has four children. Five years later he fathered a child by Helen Macintyre, an unpaid adviser in the London Assembly. Mr Johnson spoke about morality in an interview with the London Evening Standard, saying he believed wealth creation was there to fund public services such as schools and hospitals. He said: ‘I think this country was harrowed by the experience of mass unemployment in the early Eighties. ‘One of the absolute moral triumphs of this Coalition government has been to get us through the worst recession for 50 years without seeing a return to those levels of unemployment.’
You could soon unlock your phone simply by holding it up to the side of your face. Researchers have created a sensor that can recognise the unique shape of your ear, your palm or any other body part you want to use to access your device. Called Bodyprint, the technology turns a standard touchscreen into a biometric scanner removing the need to specialist hardware such as fingerprint readers or infrared cameras. Scroll down for video . Researchers at Yahoo Labs in California have created a sensor that can recognise the shape of your ear or any other body part you want to access your device (shown) Bodyprint was devised by Christian Holz, Senaka Buthpitiya, and Marius Knaust from the California-based Yahoo Labs. Details of its algorithm are included in their paper, Bodyprint: Biometric User Identification on Mobile Devices Using the Capacitive Touchscreen to Scan Body Parts. The Salt card is designed to end the tiresome task of manually unlocking a smartphone or tablet by automatically making it come to life whenever the user is nearby. The credit card-sized gadget also locks devices again as soon as a user moves out of range at a distance of ten feet (three metres). Salt connects to an app on a user’s Android handset or iPhone via Bluetooth and also tells them if they have strayed too far from their wallet, where the firm suggests the Salt card is stored. The card was created by Illinois-based duo Joel Paglione and Niko Zistakis.. They claim it will save people around 53 hours over a year, based on the belief that the average phone user unlocks their phone 150 times a day. 'Recent mobile phones integrate fingerprint scanners to authenticate users biometrically and replace passwords, making authentication more convenient for users,' explained the researchers. 'However, due to their cost, capacitive fingerprint scanners have been limited to top-of-the-line phones, a result of the required resolution and quality of the sensor.' They continued that while the input resolution of a touchscreen is around six dots per inch (dpi) - meaning it can't capture the level of detail in a fingerprint - the surface area is larger than a more advanced reader. This allows the touch sensor 'to scan users’ body parts, such as ears, fingers, fists, and palms by pressing them against the display.' To accept an incoming call, users would only need to press their ear against the phone. During tests with 12 participants, Bodyprint classified body parts with 99.98 per cent accuracy and identified users with 99.52 per cent accuracy. This accuracy was highest when scanning the ear due to its more unique shape and size. It’s not just ears that could be used for identification – your first, phalanges (in your fingers), palm or just your fingertips could also be used (shown). This means that just gripping the phone could unlock it for you . A video demonstrating the technology revealed Bioprint can also be used to add multiple users to a single device. So, for example, if something required dual identification then both people could provide it. It’s not just ears that could be used for identification - your fist, phalanges (in your fingers), palm or your fingertips could also be used. This means that just gripping the phone could unlock it for you. There's no news yet on when the feature might be made available to manufacturers, but the team says their next step is to continue testing. To accept an incoming call, users would only need to press their ear against the phone (example shown). During tests with 12 participants, Bodyprint classified body parts with 99.98 per cent accuracy and identified users with 99.52 per cent accuracy .
Footage has surfaced of a  quarrel between neighbours in a Perth suburb that ended in a bloody confrontation with a crowbar. The clip, uploaded to Facebook today, show an angry woman unleashing a racist tirade over her fence at a group of men who appear to be of African descent.

The saying 'two is company but three's a crowd' clearly didn't apply to James Corden as he met two Beckham sporting stars. The comedian tweeted a picture on Thursday alongside former England captain David Beckham and New York Giants' NFL hotshot Odell Beckham Jnr. Accompanied with the caption: 'Double Beckhams!' Corden was all smiles as he posed in between the duo. James Corden (centre) posted a picture alongside Odell Beckham Jnr (left) and David Beckham via Twitter . Both Beckhams, who are of no relation, were pictured in America with the 36-year-old - who is currently filming late-night talk show Late Late in the States. Last month David Beckham lifted the lid on his son Brooklyn's first date, in which the former Manchester United midfielder watched on from a nearby table in a London restaurant. Speaking as a guest on Corden's show, the ex-Real Madrid and LA Galaxy star told the hilarious story of his 16-year-old son's first foray into the world of dating. When probed by Corden, who asked, 'He must be getting quite big into the dating circuit now?', Beckham replied: ''Yeah, it's happening. He's going to hate me for this. 'I'm fine with it, because on his first date - when he was about 14 and a half - it was Valentine's Day so he said, "I'd love to take this girl to dinner." David Beckham embarrassed his son Brooklyn on James Corden's Late Late Show in America last month . Brooklyn watched on from the audience as his father told the story of his first date, at a sushi bar in London . 'I said, "Okay, great." I spoke to Victoria, and she was like, "Really?", so I said, "Yeah, he's going to do it." 'She said, "Okay, make sure you take him and then make sure you sit in the restaurant." So I was like, "Really, you're going to make me do that?" and she said "Yeah, that's the only way I'm going to let him go."' 'So we took him to a small sushi restaurant and he sat at the sushi bar and I sat about five tables back. By the way, my daughter is four years old. When she gets to that age, I will be closer than that!' Beckham's son Brooklyn, who was sat in the audience as his dad retold the embarrassing story, is aiming to follow in his father's footsteps by becoming a professional footballer. This season, he has been playing for Arsenal's Under 16s but was recently dealt a blow with the news that the Gunners will not hand him a new deal at the end of the season. Brooklyn is looking to follow in his father's footsteps by becoming a professional footballer .

Ed Miliband's poor leadership has been mocked by a Labour candidate, who said it was like having 'a manager of a football team that you don't rate, but you still support the team'. Paul Gilbert even joked that he hoped his 'off-piste' comment would not 'find it's way back' to the Labour leadership, because he stands little hope of winning in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire. He also blasted Labour's 'entirely unsatisfactory' policy on tuition fees and told voters at a university hustings: 'I don't like where we are.' Scroll down for video . Labour candidate Paul Gilbert mocked Ed Miliband and then joked that he hoped his 'off-piste' comment would not 'find it's way back' to the Labour leadership . Mr Miliband has faced repeated criticism and off-the-record briefing about his leadership among Labour ranks, but most have seen the sense of keeping quiet about their misgivings during the election campaign. But Mr Gilbert felt no such reservations as he appeared at a hustings event with four other candidates. The 52-year-old lawyer was asked for his comments on higher eduction funding by a member of the audience at the packed event at the University of Gloucestershire. He said: 'If I can go off-piste a little, as somebody who has a very realistic idea of what the maths will be in this constituency, maybe what I say isn't going to find it's way back to Mr Miliband and his friends.' He added: 'Now one of the things which has brought me to politics at this very late stage you might think is the wish to make a difference. Now I am a Labour man and I will stand by my party, thick and thin. 'It's a bit like having a manager of a football team that you don't rate, but you still support the team, sometimes. 'What we have to do is work out how we can make the difference best, and from my point of view you're better on the inside making a difference than being on the outside grumbling about it.' To laughter from the audience, he was mocked by one of his fellow candidates for his 'glowing endorsement' for Labour's leader. Ed Miliband, pictured giving a speech in Stockton-on-Tees today, has promised to cut tuition fees from up to £9,000 to £6,000 if he is elected on May 7 . Ed Miliband has revealed his childhood dream was to become a London bus conductor. The Labour leader said a fascination with the ticket machines on the old-style vehicles had made him want the job. Mr Miliband made the admission during a visit to Stockton-on-Tees, where he was asked by a young boy in the audience, Nelson Driscoll, what he wanted to be when he was seven years old. He replied: 'I wanted to be a bus conductor. I tell you why, because on the London buses there used to be these things where you used to turn around the ticket machine. I was particularly fascinated by that.' Mr Miliband is not the only party leader to have dreamed of being on the buses. Conservative former prime minister Sir John Major once failed a test to become a bus conductor. The seat of Cheltenham is held by the Lib Dem Martin Horwood, who secured a majority of 4,920 over the Conservatives in 2010. But the constituency is seen as crucial to Tory hopes of winning an overall majority in the Commons. However, five years ago Labour secured just 5 per cent of the vote. Mr Miliband has promised to cut tuition fees from up to £9,000 to £6,000 if he is elected on May 7. Critics have argued the only people to benefit from the reductions will be wealthy graduates, because most people would never pay back the full amount during their working lifetime. But Mr Gilbert appeared to suggest the party should have gone further in reducing the cost of gaining a degree. He said: 'You know that in the Labour manifesto the fees will come down to £6,000 - it still feels entirely unsatisfactory.' He added: 'But it seems to me with two daughters who are 22 and 20, and they have been saddled with debt as the gentleman in the audience mentioned earlier. 'I find it really silly and really ridiculous that we have not worked this one through sufficiently well. 'We have choices. We have choices for all sorts of things, but we choose to spend the money on other things, and I wish we didn't, I wish we really didn't.' He finished his criticism of his party by adding: 'I don't like where we are, I wish it was different, but I hope we can see it differently going forward.'
A New York taxi driver has been ordered to pay a lesbian couple $10,000 in damages after he told them to stop kissing in the back of his cab. Mohammed Dahbi discriminated against actress Kassie Thornton and her TV executive partner Christy Spitzer after ordering them to 'keep that behavior for the bedroom'. He warned that if they ignored his request during the trip on September 18, 2011, he would throw them out. Outraged: Mohammed Dahbi was accused of discrimination after ordering actress Kassie Thornton and her TV executive partner Christy Spitzer to stop kissing and 'keep that behavior for the bedroom'. He was ordered to pay the couple $10,000 in fines . When they got out, Dahbi also called the pair 'b*****', 'c****' and 'whores' after they refused to pay the fare and walked away. He claimed during the city's Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings they were 'touching each other all over' and 'kissing heavily' . But according to DNAinfo New York, Judge John Spooner disagreed and ordered him to pay the fine. He also made him attend anti-discrimination training and pay a $5,000 civil penalty to the city. Ms Spitzer told the news website: 'We felt that what happened to us was wrong and he needed to take responsibility for his actions. The trip began at Columbus Circle when Ms Spizter climbed into the yellow cab with her dog and headed to pick Ms Thronton up in Chelsea, before heading to Sunset Park in Brooklyn. However, when they hit the Meatpacking District, Dahbi turned around and barked the orders at them. Verbal abuse: When the pair (pictured) got out, Dahbi also called them 'b*****', 'c****' and 'whores' after they refused to pay the fare and walked away . They said he was discriminating against them because they were gay, to which he replied: 'Don't make me out to be an a**hole.' They insist it was just a peck on the lips. Spizter told DNAinfo she knew this because she had just been to the dentist. She said: 'That’s why I’m so aware of what my behavior was in the taxi.' Dahbi's lawyer, Ali Najmi said he had never mentioned anything about the pair's sexuality and has a 'standard of decency'. They are now planning to appeal the decision. In a statement on his firm's website, he said: 'We will be pursuing an appeal of this decision. The Administrative Judge acted unreasonably and made conclusions of fact that cannot be substantiated based on the record. The fine amount is completely unfair given that there was no real injury here.'
Whether it's a chocolate bar that no longer satisfies your appetite or washing powder which now runs out before your next shop, many of our big brands are shrinking their products. The latest casualty are boxes of Cadbury's Fingers which, it was announced yesterday, will contain two fewer chocolate fingers from now on. They join Creme Eggs, PG Tips teabags and even John West tuna in the ever-increasing list of goods getting smaller. Scroll down for video . Shape changer: The rounded chunks look nice - but they give you 14 per cent less Dairy Milk chocolate . Even if maths isn't your cup of tea, it's easy to see you're now getting fewer tea bags per pack of Blend of Both . Good old Bessie? Not so - she's nicked 50g of your homestyle chips that are cooked in a 'crispy batter' But while it may be better for your waistline, it's not better for your pocket if manufacturers and supermarkets don't pass on the cost saving to consumers. When John West shrunk its No Drain Tuna Steak In Brine from 130g to 120g, the price stayed at £1 in Morrisons. And there was no change in the £5 cost of Surf with Essential Oils Washing Powder when it dropped from 2kg to 1.61kg. It's seemingly part of a strategy across the retail industry that enables manufacturers to increase profits without putting up prices (and thus risk losing customers). It's now so common, it's even got a name: 'shrinkflation'. In its latest issue, consumer watchdog Which? reveals a host of products that have been shrunk, from Surf washing powder and Cif spray to Hovis Best Of Both bread, while the price remains the same. 'Shrinking products can be an underhand way of raising prices because pack sizes shrink but the prices don't. Consumers will feel angry that they are being short-changed by some of their favourite brands,' says Which? executive director Richard Lloyd. 'It's time for action on dodgy pricing practices that stop people from comparing products to find the cheapest.' It's fiendishly difficult to compare prices properly nowadays because special offers mean they change frequently. Indeed, very often a negative story about a product shrinking in the media will lead to its price magically shrinking. For example, after being featured in Which? this month because it had dropped from 750ml to 700ml but stayed at the same £2 price in Asda, the supermarket giant discounted Cif Actifizz Lemon Multi Purpose Spray to £1.75. F ood industry commentator Martin Isark believes the shrinking ploy is becoming more widespread. 'It's now common practice among the big confectioners and their argument is that they reduce the size so they don't have to put the prices up,' he says. 'Ping-pong prices going up and down almost daily confuse the shopper so the brands can reduce the size without the customer ever realising. 'Most of us buy on price, which is why they get away with this.' Other confectionery goods that have gone the same way as Cadbury's Fingers include Mars Bars (down from an original bumper 58g to 48g since 2013), Kit Kat Chunky (down from 48g to 40g earlier this year) and in 2011, the tins of Cadbury's Roses chocolates shrank from 975g to 850g, the equivalent loss of 11 chocolates. Sometimes, changes are obvious, such as Cadbury altering the shape of its chocolate. On other occasions, the clues are more subtle — a pasta sauce taking less time to warm suggests you are getting less of it. The new version of Tesco's Tomato and Mascarpone sauce is a minute quicker to cook - as you get 25g less . Whoever heard of a pack of FIVE eggs? It seems Cadbury has when it controversially took an egg out the box . Angus Kennedy, editor of trade magazine Kennedy's Confection, says one of the worst examples of shrinkflation was Cadbury's reducing the number of Creme Eggs in a box from half-a-dozen to five in the run-up to Easter (both sizes cost £1 at Iceland). 'If these companies said: 'We're sorry but we have no choice but to do this because cocoa is now in short supply,' then I think the British public would be much more understanding,' he says. 'What we don't like is feeling duped when we realise what the companies are up to.' Especially when they're still paying £1 for a sharing bag of Maltesers that's down from 140g to 120g (in fact, Cadbury's fingers have gone up from £1 to £1.50 in Sainsbury's this year despite the shrinkage). Confectionery companies have argued that a reduction in the size of their bars is not all about rising production costs but is also an attempt to support the Government's drive to help people lose weight in the face of an obesity epidemic. Mr Kennedy disputes this, saying that as the bars get smaller, people are likely to just buy and eat more. Manufacturers often claim that, when they reduce the size of a product, they pass on savings to shops but cannot guarantee that they will, in turn, bring down retail prices. Firms that were approached by Which? were unwilling to go into specifics, saying the information was 'confidential'. Spreading it thinly: Philly is down 10 per cent. But at least it's healthier with less fat and salt... Going down: Cadbury has snatched two chocolate Fingers from its famous packs – reducing the number to 22 . Now 114 grams: Cadbury chocolate Fingers have come down by 11g - the equivalent of two chocolate Fingers . Vince Bamford, buying and supply editor of The Grocer, says shrinkflation has taken off because suppliers are under pressure to maintain profit margins to keep shareholders happy and believe consumers prefer smaller products to price increases. 'When we were in recession, suppliers and retailers were very wary of raising prices,' he says. 'But I don't think it would do them any harm to be more honest with consumers. To say: 'We're having to pay 10 per cent more for our products and we're having to pass some of that cost on to you.' ' Instead, customers are left feeling short-changed. 'Food and drink pricing always reflects the economic climate of the day, whether that's the impact of changing utility prices or ingredient costs, which can be volatile,' says a Food And Drink Federation spokesperson. 'Businesses seek to offset these costs wherever possible through improvements in efficiency and productivity, but these actions can only go so far, and in some cases companies will reduce the pack size rather than increasing the price for consumers.' However, it's the underhand way in which these product changes appear to be introduced that leaves a bad taste in the mouths of so many.
Pete Evans has been slammed by medical professionals for promoting fluoride-free water . Health Minister Jillian Skinner has slammed celebrity chef Pete Evans for promoting fluoride-free water, saying he is putting people's health at risk with his extreme views on diet and lifestyle. It comes after concerned medical professionals  described Evans' standpoint as misinformed and a potentially dangerous lifestyle choice after he revealed his family also steers clear of consuming Australian tap water. Ms Skinner said she was 'highly disappointed' to see the My Kitchen Rules judge use his power as a high profile media personality to influence in areas he had no expertise, in which she has refused to watch his reality cooking show. 'Here we are spending a lot of effort and energy in educating people about the value of fluoridation, about the fact that there are no risks associated with ­vaccination, or very low risks, and that there is no connection between vaccination and autism, and it is countered by a celebrity who knows nothing from a specialist point of view,' she told The Sunday Telegraph. 'I'm highly disappointed that they would use a platform of cooking. That is totally inappropriate and quite disturbing, which is why I won't watch those programs anymore.' Evans' has responded to the Health Minister's concerns, saying he would like to discuss the benefits of water fluoridation. 'I welcome the opportunity to ­discuss the value of fluoridation with Ms Skinner, but ask that she, or any other party, does not misrepresent my views, opinions or beliefs.' The revelation follows after Evans threw his weight behind an anti-fluoride campaign where he proudly wore a 'Fluoride Free WA' t-shirt on Facebook to promote the Perth-based lobby group's cause. Health Minister Jillian Skinner has slammed celebrity chef Pete Evans for promoting fluoride-free water . Evans has also been under fire for endorsing the Paleo diet which cuts out dairy, cereal and processed meats . Some slogans on the Fluoride Free WA Facebook page that Evans is a passionate advocate for . 'Alkalised water (maybe I just should've just said filtered water?) - we have a portable mineral pot ($500) water filter which rids tap water from potential carcinogens (chorine, chemicals, bacteria etc),' he said in a post on his Facebook page. Evans and his family don't drink tap water . 'I realise there's plenty of controversy around alkalised water, but I would rather choose this option over drinking tap water or bottled water, as it works out cheaper in the long run, and is environmentally friendly.' Australian Medical Association Victorian president Tony Bartone hit back at the outspoken chef telling Daily Mail Australia that Evans needed to stick to what he does best. 'All evidence at this stage both reliable studies and research from universities, the World Health Organisation, and by the Australian Dental Association points to the fact that basically fluoridation is an important public health initiative - it does prevent tooth decay,' Dr Bartone said. 'Celebrity chefs should stick to their knitting and stay out of the debate - his comments belong back in the Stone Age.' 'People like this are using their fame and influence in areas that they have no expertise - obviously a top class chef but when it comes to scientific research and understanding - they are lacking.' Evans has previously been slammed for his endorsement of the controversial Paleo diet, which his family abides by, that includes meat, fish, vegetables, and fruit but excludes dairy or cereal products and processed food. 'I'm occasionally ridiculed or accused of ignorance because I choose to eat and feed my family what I believe to be a nutrient dense diet,' he said on his Facebook page. 'I can't help but find it so bizarre as to why some people find my food choices so offensive?' He says his decisions are an important part of being a parent - adding that 'ignorance is not bliss'. 'I'm a father and I take that privilege very seriously, so for me striving for optimum health and trying new things whenever possible, so that I can be a responsible role model for my daughters and still be able to surf right up until the end, is the ultimate goal,' he posted. Evans (left) says his role as a father is to strive for optimum health for his children . The My Kitchen Rules judge (pictured with fellow judge Manu Fieldel left) thinks it is bizarre that some people find his food choices so offensive . However, Dr Bartone sees Evans' stance as abusing his high profile media personality. 'It is influencing vulnerable others - people who are time-poor - and will unfortunately just look at celebrity endorsement and think it must be good and follow the argument without delving into the facts, he said. 'It affects the health message we are trying to impart on our patients and the community at large - especially in times when know that health and well-being is crucial and key to a number of illnesses and health factors that have a huge cross burden on society.'
After exposing potential security risks with airlines' in-flight entertainment systems, one of the top experts on counter-threat intelligence in the wold was pulled off a flight by FBI agents. Chris Roberts, who featured in a string of Fox News reports, was yanked off his plane after it landed in Syracuse, New York, on Wednesday night by two FBI agents and two uniformed officers. Roberts, who works for security intelligence company One World Labs, was questioned for the next four hours. Scroll down for video . Chris Roberts of One World Labs was grabbed after his plane landed in Syracuse, New York, on Wednesday . Roberts has been featured on the Fox News television show On the Record with Greta Van Susteren (left) The FBI agents took electronic devices and computer files from Roberts and confiscated his laptop and thumb drives, Fox News reported. They asked to forensically image his laptop, but Roberts told the agents to get a warrant. He was coming to town to speak at an aerospace conference about vulnerabilities in airplane systems and did make a presentation at the event on Thursday without the use of his electronics. The incident occurred only a few hours after a report about Roberts' research was released by Fox. Roberts said in the report: 'We can still take planes out of the sky thanks to the flaws in the in-flight entertainment systems. 'Quite simply put, we can theorize on how to turn the engines off at 35,000 feet and not have any of those damn flashing lights go off in the cockpit.' Experts worry planes' flight and entertainment systems could be compromised by terrorist hacking (file photo) The Government Accountability Office released a report earlier this week with similar findings. The GAO report stated: 'According to cybersecurity experts we interviewed, Internet connectivity in the cabin should be considered a direct link between the aircraft and the outside world, which includes potential malicious actors.' Roberts is scheduled to fly home Friday and is already pre-checked through the TSA. He said: 'You have one element in the FBI reaching out to people like me for help, but another element doing a hell of a job burning those bridges. 'Those of us who do threat research are doing it for the right reasons, and we work to build relationships with the intelligence community because we want to help them identify weaknesses before they become a problem.'
A freezer trawler has sunk in a peninsula off the coast of Russia, killing at least 56 crew members. A massive rescue operation involving more than 1,300 people is now underway after the ship, carrying an international crew of 132, sank in the Sea of Okhotsk in just 15 minutes. Rescued crew members reported that the ship, called the Dalny Vostock, was unstable because of empty fuel tanks and a lack of ballast as it sailed through the Kamchatka Peninsula. The Russian freezer trawler, called the Dalny Vostok, that sank while carrying 132 crew members at 4am on Thursday morning local time. At least 54 bodies have been recovered in the huge rescue operation . Map showing the location of the disaster. There are 13 members of the crew are still missing after the trawler tipped over when a fishing net was pulled in, a regional governor told Russian television on Thursday . It tipped over when a fishing net weighing 80 tons was pulled in, said Oleg Kozhemyako, acting governor of the nearby Sakhalin region. Kozhemyako's comments on Russian television came after the federal Investigative Committee said it was considering all possible causes for the sinking, but it was likely that the trawler hit 'an object' floating in the sea, perhaps drifting ice. More than 26 fishing boats in the area have helped to rescue members of the crew, but have also recovered 56 bodies. The disaster happened at around 4am local time, and the trawler did not send any distress signals before it sank, the Interfax News Agency said. Early reports added that the Dalny Vostok sank in just 15 minutes after its engine compartment had been flooded. So far 63 people have been rescued, with survivors suffering from hypothermia and other injuries being airlifted to hospital. At the latest count there are 13 people still missing. An emergency services representative told local media that two of the bodies were found on Thursday evening - one in a lifeboat 105 kilometres (65 miles) away, and the other in the water nearby. Those saved had managed to get into lifeboats and some had put on wet suits. The Russian Emergencies Ministry sent an Mi-8 helicopter with rescuers and doctors aboard to treat and transport rescued crew members to hospitals in the city of Magadan, it said on its website. A rescuer uses a satellite phone while onboard a helicopter as they fly over the Sea of Okhotsk scouring the waters for survivors. Around 1,300 fishermen and emergency staff are involved in the rescue operation . A Russian Emergencies Ministry ship looks for survivors after the Dalny Vostock sank. Temperatures in the water can dip to as low as -2 degrees celsius, and so far it is confirmed that 56 crew members have drowned . A telephone hotline for families of the crew has also been set up. Among the 132 crew members, 78 are from Russia, 42 from Myanmar and the rest from Latvia, Ukraine and Vanuatu. Pyotr Osichansky, president of the Far Eastern Association of Sea Captains, told Russian television that when the trawler last docked in Russia, in January, it had fewer than 70 crew members. The additional crew members were most likely picked up in Pusan, South Korea, and were working illegally, he said. The Sea of Okhotsk is the coldest sea in East Asia with the air temperature plummeting to -20 degrees Celsius in the winter months. Following the tragedy 63 people have been rescued, but the bodies of 56 sailors have been pulled from the freezing sea. Early reports say the trawler sank in 15 minutes when its engine room was flooded . Between October and April the area the area is 'constantly' covered with ice and there is very little rain, according to Encyclopedia Britannica. Survivors of the incident are reportedly being interviewed as well as the owners of the trawler, as the police start investigating the disaster. It is understood they are questioning whether there was a violation of safety procedures that led to more deaths, a report in Russia Today said. The 100-metre long trawler was built in 1989 and was equipped to freeze and can fish.
The grey ‘stealth’ speed traps could be outlawed regardless of which party wins the general election . Hidden cameras credited with a 25 per cent spike in speeding fines could be banned from motorways within months. The grey ‘stealth’ speed traps could be outlawed regardless of which party wins the general election, it has been suggested. New figures revealed at least 112,000 motorists were given fines or appeared in court for motorway offences last year – a quarter more than in the previous year. The increase has been put down to the introduction of ‘smart motorways’ which use the cameras, known as Hadecs, to police speed limits which are varied according to the driving conditions. This means many drivers are being given the minimum £100 fines despite driving under the national motorway speed limit of 70mph. The Conservatives are already moving to scrap the controversial cameras if an ongoing review criticises their use when it reports back in the summer. And Labour has pledged to repaint them yellow so they are easier for drivers to spot. The grey cameras are becoming an increasing threat to drivers as the number of smart motorways is due to increase four fold over the next 10 years to stretch across 800 miles. But Labour has said if it wins the election, it will issue new guidelines stipulating all motorway speed cameras are yellow and any existing grey ones will be painted. A party source told The Sunday Telegraph there was a loophole which allowed the grey cameras on major roads but not smaller roads. Most of the drivers were caught last year were caught on parts of the M25, M1, M4 and M5. Roads minister John Hayes, who ordered the Highways England review which is due to report back this summer, has said he was concerned about ‘stealth cameras’ and it was important drivers knew where they were. The use of the less noticeable cameras has led to claims that police are using stealth to catch out drivers . And a Conservative source yesterday said: ‘We’ve announced a review into this and if that review shows serious problems, we will take action to stop grey cameras.’ Nearly 113,000 drivers were handed speeding penalties last year according to Freedom of Information statistics provided by 24 out of 45 police forces compared to close to 89,000 in 2013 and almost 55,000 in 2010. If caught by a speed camera, drivers face a minimum £100 fine and three points on their licence, or a court summons. Avon and Somerset police caught 23,086 motorists speeding in 2014 – a rise of 756 on the year before, and Nottinghamshire police fined 9,472 drivers - up from 3,808. And both forces have linked the rises to the use of the grey cameras. A Highways England spokesman said: ‘It has always been up to individual police forces whether to use cameras on the motorway network to enforce the national speed limit.’ As the use of smart motorways is extended from current levels of around 200 miles to 800 miles over the next ten years the number of fines is set to rise even more .
No mechanical faults have been found on a plane that was forced to make an emergency landing when three passengers passed out and others felt sick. SkyWest Airlines flight 5622 was flying from Chicago to Connecticut when the pilot was alerted to a potential loss of cabin pressure. As an increasing number of passengers began to complain of dizzyness, and three lost consciousness, the pilot plunged the aircraft into a terrifying dive to drop 30,000 feet in just eight minutes - before landing in Buffalo, New York. But despite the calamitous events, an investigation has discovered nothing unusual about the mechanics of the plane. Scroll down for video . Emergency responders came onboard SkyWest Flight 5622 after it made an emergency landing in Buffalo, New York, on Wednesday following a reported loss of cabin pressure . Mary Cunningham, a nurse, who was on board the flight assisted one passenger who passed out, getting her oxygen. She said that the plane did not land because of just one person's medical emergency as a lot of people on board began to feel dizzy and unwell . Passenger Frank Angelo said he immediately feared for the safety of his wife and kids as the plane 'nosedived' 30,000 feet in just eight minutes . 'You could feel something in the air, something just wasn't right,' recalled one passenger before the plane plunged miles in mere minutes. Passenger Larry Johnson, right, said: 'A lot of people with their heads down praying. It just felt like a re-enactment' While federal safety officials had no explanation for what happened on the aircraft on Wednesday, aviation experts said the flight crew did the right thing by quickly descending to an altitude with life-giving oxygen levels. The situation arose about an hour after take-off, when three passengers on the Embraer 175 twin-jet from Chicago to Connecticut  lost consciousness and others began feeling dizzy and sick. Emergency nurse, Mary Cunningham, said she helped treat an unconscious passenger when another passed out beside her and others nearby started feeling faint. 'The flight attendant and myself started not feeling very well while we were in the middle of the flight helping out. I had to sit down. I was short-of-breath, light-headed [and] didn't feel great,' said Cunningham to NBC Connecticut. Initially, reports came in that a cabin door had opened during the flight, leading to dramatic loss in cabin pressure. When the plane landed at 11.40am, the FAA issued a statement saying the crew 'reported a pressurization problem and declared an emergency', shortly before landing in Buffalo. However, in a second statement the FAA put out on Wednesday afternoon, there was no mention of a 'pressurization' issue. When contacted by the LA Times to explain this, a spokesperson for the FAA would not say why the change was made. However, an official with knowledge of the incident told the LA Times that crew members did report that a door had come open at 38,000 feet and was causing 'rapid depressurization.' When the plane landed, SkyWest initially claimed that the aircraft landed 'out of an abundance of caution' because of one sick passenger and denied there was any mechanical malfunction - which conflicted with reports from people on the plane. Late on Wednesday, the airline said new information from medical personnel confirmed that 'a total of three passengers reported a loss of consciousness while on the flight'. On landing this was declared untrue and SkyWest airlines said they were examining what happened on the aircraft midflight. SkyWest spokeswoman Marissa Snow said: 'There were no reports before the unconscious passenger prior to the initiated descent, but I can't speak to what may have been the specific cause of their feeling ill.' SkyWest added that there was no indication of any problems with the doors and that its mechanics were inspecting the aircraft. Nose dive: Emergency vehicles surround a SkyWest Airlines plane, operating as United Express, that made an emergency landing at Buffalo Niagara International Airport on Wednesday . Flight 5622, from Chicago to Hartford, made an emergency landing in Buffalo . Passenger, Dave Barkley, 46, told the LA Times that he was sat near the front of the aircraft and he saw a flight attendant race to the cockpit and tell the pilot passengers were falling unconscious. Suddenly, the pilot announced the plane was going to begin an emergency landing over Detroit. 'They said there was a pressure problem with the plane,' he said. 'There was no door flying open or anything like that. It was something very gradual.' Barkley said that while the passengers were calm, he was annoyed about with public statements the airline has made. 'The way SkyWest is reporting it is that someone got sick, and they had to land,' he told the LA Times. 'But the way we understand it, they got sick because of the lack of oxygen or lack of pressure in the plane.' A nurse flying on the Embraer 175 twin-jet described a growing sense of panic and hysteria as she herself began to feel ill while treating two women who had passed out. It was at that moment the pilot took decisive action and put the plane into a steep dive rather than take any risks. 'The passenger was lethargic. She was responding but her color was off. She didn't look good. We got her some oxygen. She was much more alert after getting the oxygen,' the nurse, Mary Cunningham, tells NBC Connecticut. Cunningham says she returned to her seat once the woman felt better. It was then when she says the woman sitting behind the first passed out, as well. Then Cunningham, herself, took a turn.

I was short-of-breath, light-headed [and] didn't feel great.' Passenger Larry Johnson said, 'A lot of people with their heads down praying. It just felt like a re-enactment.' While another passenger said, 'you could just feel something in the air, something just wasn't quite right.' For nearly eight minutes, the plane descended at a very steep incline, dropping as fast as 7,000 feet per minute, while flying over Lake Erie, flight tracking service FlightAware said. The flight originated in Chicago and had been bound for Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks, Connecticut. It landed at Buffalo Niagara International Airport in Buffalo at about 11:40 a.m. SkyWest Inc., which is based in St. George, Utah, said the jet landed safely and a passenger received medical attention before being released. An additional 15 adults and two children were evaluated upon landing, but none required treatment outside the airport, airport spokesman C. Douglas Hartmayer said. 'Anyone who said they didn't feel well was treated at the gate,' he said. 'We want to understand the circumstances and what SkyWest knows before we decide what, if any, action we would take,' said Kelly Nantel, spokeswoman for the National Transportation Safety Board. Snow said the plane's oxygen masks did not release. According to WKBW, one passenger said the plane 'nosedived' and crew told fliers that there was a loss of cabin pressure, but that turned out not to be true. SkyWest has 29 Embraer 175s in its fleet. The aircraft seats 76 passengers with two flight attendants. In a statement, the FAA said: 'SkyWest Airlines Flight 5622, an Embraer E170 aircraft, landed safely at Buffalo International Airport at 11.40am after the crew declared an emergency. 'The FAA will investigate.' The Skywest flight made an emergency landing at Buffalo Airport (pictured) on its journey from Chicago O'Hare to Bradley International Airport in Connecticut .
Comics at the BBC must go through a lengthy process to get some jokes on air because the Corporation is extra-wary about causing offence, an editor at the company has claimed. Chris Sussman, executive editor for comedy, revealed particular jokes have to go through 'quite a lot of layers' to be approved. Some jokes even have to be looked over by director general Lord Hall - alongside editorial policy advisers, the channel and legal advisers - before they are aired, he said. Comics at the BBC must go through a lengthy process to get jokes on air, including some being looked over by director general Lord Hall (left), an editor at the company claimed. It is because the Corporation is extra-wary about causing offence - like in the Sachsgate scandal involving Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross (right) The cautious attitude comes after a 'difficult few years', Mr Sussman added. Speaking at a Bafta event The Telegraph reported him saying: 'It's been a difficult few years and I think that is reflected internally in terms of the processes and procedures we go through when we’re making programmes. 'To get a certain joke on air, to get a joke approved, we have to go through quite a lot of layers. 'Sometimes we’ll run something past at script stage, if we’re unsure. Most of the time it’s about "here’s the show, have a look at it".' The strict rules come after a 'difficult few years' following the Sachsgate scandal, where Ross and Brand left lewd messages on Andrew Sachs' (left) voicemail, Mr Sussman added. Comedian Frankie Boyle (right) has previously criticised the BBC about its cautious attitude towards comedy . Mr Sussman joined the Corporation after Jonathan Ross and Russell Brand caused outrage by broadcasting a series of answer phone messages they left with Andrew Sachs. The messages included lewd comments about Brand's relationship with Sachs' granddaughter, Georgina Baillie. Comedian Frankie Boyle has previously criticised the BBC about its cautious attitude towards comedy. He called the Trust cowardly for the broadcaster’s lack of political comedy in 2010 shortly after leaving Mock The Week. In an open letter Boyle added that the BBC wanted to 'deliver the flavour of political comedy with none of the content'. John Lloyd,  producer of Blackadder and Not the Nine O'Clock News, added that comedy that is not funny could 'sink the corporation'.
The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has denied that partisan politics in Washington DC could derail America's landmark agreement to curb Iran's nuclear capabilities. Countering President Barack Obama's previous assertion, Senator Bob Corker, a Republican from Tennessee, said on Sunday that congressional oversight 'doesn't mean there won't be a deal'. The 62-year-old politician continued: 'We just set in place a process to ensure that if there's a deal, it's a deal that will stand the test of time, that will keep Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.' Making an appearance on Fox News Sunday, Corker  said that Congressional scrutiny and approval of any nuclear agreement with Iran is essential to help make sure that the deal is not a bad one. Scroll down for video . Chairman: Senator Bob Corker (pictured), of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has denied partisan politics in Washington DC could derail America's landmark agreement to curb Iran's nuclear capabilities . He said that Congress has a responsibility to scour the details of a final plan - including any classified annexes - and ask the Obama administration hard questions about it, before finally voting on it. 'It's very important that Congress is in the middle of this, understanding, teasing out, asking those important questions,' Corker said. Negotiators announced a framework deal on Thursday. The deal is scheduled to be finalized by June 30. Meanwhile, the Committee is due to meet April 14 to consider Corker's legislation to ensure that Congress debates and signs off on any pact. The bill requires the president to transmit, within five days of reaching a final deal, the text of the full agreement, along with materials related to its implementation. With key elements still to be finalized, the framework agreement sealed by U.S.-led world powers describes a program for stunting Iran's capacity to produce nuclear weapons, while giving Tehran quick access to assets and markets now blocked by international sanctions. In defending the framework and a potential final pact, US Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz cited what he called 'unprecedented access and transparency' into Iran's nuclear activities. Argument: Countering President Barack Obama's (pictured) previous assertion, Corker, a Republican from Tennessee, told Fox News Sunday that congressional oversight 'doesn't mean there won't be a deal' These will allow the U.S. and its partner negotiators to know almost instantly should Iran try to evade the oversight, Moniz said during an appearance on CBS' 'Face The Nation. This is a long-term arrangement, he stressed, with requirements lasting a quarter century or more. 'We'll have eyes on the entire supply chain of uranium,' he added on the program. 'Going back to mines, the mills, we'll have continuous surveillance of centrifuge production.' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has criticized the framework as deeply flawed and a threat to Israel's very existence. He is urging negotiators to improve the agreement or scuttle it. Other Republicans have echoed Netanyahu's concerns. Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, said on Sunday the proposed deal is a bad one - but was the best one Obama could get because the Iranians don't fear or respect him. Response: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (left) has criticized the framework deal as deeply flawed and a threat to Israel's very existence. But in defending the framework, US Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz (right) cited what he called 'unprecedented access and transparency' into Iran's nuclear activities . He said that he favors waiting until a new president, Democratic or Republican, takes office in January 2017 and then trying again. In the meantime, economic and financial sanctions would stay in place. 'Is there a better deal to be had? I think so,' Graham said on CBS' 'Face The Nation.' But a senior Senate Democrat, Dianne Feinstein, warned that bashing the proposed deal could backfire on Netanyahu. The Israeli prime minister and other critics of the framework agreement have offered no viable alternatives, she said on CNN's 'State of the Union.' Feinstein said imposing more and stiffer economic sanctions would only drive Iran's nuclear program deeper underground and make it more difficult to monitor. 'I wish he would contain himself,' Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said of Netanyahu. Officials (L-r) European Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Federica Mogherini, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarifat, and an unidentified Russian official, look on as British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond shakes hands with Secretary of State John Kerry in Switzerland . The preliminary deal,  announced in Switzerland on Thursday, sees Iran agree to not build any new centrifuges for 15 years, and not enrich uranium at the previously secret Fordow site for 15 years. The country also agrees to reduce nuclear-material centrifuges from 19,000 to 6,104, let the IAEA store all the extra centrifuges, give IAEA inspectors access to its uranium mills for 25 years and rebuild heavy-water reactor at Arak so it can't produce weapons-grade plutonium. And it would not build any new heavy-water reactors for 15 years. In return, the West will give Iran relief from nuclear-related economic sanctions 'if it verifiably abides by its commitments', and lift 'all past UN Security Council resolutions on the Iran nuclear issue' as soon as Iran has completed all its promised 'nuclear-related actions'. America's sanctions on Iran relating to 'terrorism, human rights abuses, and ballistic missiles' will remain in place.
The Arizona police officer who rammed his car into an armed suspect was previously involved in a lawsuit while working for the New York Police Department. Michael Rapiejko was accused of approaching a man as he got out of his car in October 2005 and pointing a gun at him before handcuffing him and threatening to shoot him in front of his wife and four children. The plaintiff, Luis Colon, also claimed that Rapiejko choked him and ordered that he get back into his car. Scroll down for videos . Michael Rapiejko (above) was accused of approaching Luis Colon as he got out of his car in October 2005, pointing a gun at him and threatening to shoot him . According to NBC 4, Rapiejko's defense team said that while their client did point a gun at the man and order him back into his car, the other claims were untrue. Colon was charged with obstructing governmental administration, resisting arrest and disorderly conduct, all charges that were dropped in April 2006. In the end, the city settled with Colon for $20,000 under the condition that he dismiss all other claims. The settlement was reached in December 2008, the same time Rapiejko left the New York Police Department and joined the Tucson Police Department. This as Rapiejko is under fire for using possible excessive force when he mowed down an armed suspect (above) in his police vehicle . The officer joined the Marana Police Department roughly a year-and-a-half ago, where he is now being investigated by Internal Affairs. Rapiejko, a Cross Fit devotee, calls himself Robocop. Video of the February 19 incident emerged earlier this week, and shows Rapiejko, 34, running into suspect Mario Valencia, who was carrying what appears to be a rifle, and who seems to point the weapon to the sky and fire off shots. A police officer in one of the patrol cars says: 'One round just went out. He's definitely loaded.' He then tells his colleague, Officer Michael Rapiejko, in the other vehicle: 'Stand off, the gun is loaded.' Mario Valencia (above) was in the hospital for two days after being hit by Rapiejko . But apparently ignoring his advice, Rapiejko overtakes the officer's car, before speeding straight toward Valencia. Seconds later, his vehicle mounts the curb and smashes into the suspect's body. Valencia is sent flying into the air, while the car crashes through a concrete wall before coming to a halt amid debris. The other officer can be heard shouting in shock: 'Oh! Jesus Christ, man down.' Valencia was rushed to University of Arizona Medical Center in serious condition following the crash and was eventually booked into jail two days later. Sergeant Chris Warren said at the time that Valencia 'was a dangerous felon who'd been on a crime spree throughout the morning'. This crime spree allegedly involved theft at a convenience store at, vandalism and burglary at the Tucson Baptist Temple, a home invasion and theft of a car. It culminated with the alleged theft of a rifle from Walmart, after which he was hit by Rapiejko's police vehicle. Rapiejko was put on standard administrative leave after the crash, but soon reinstated after the Pima County Attorney's Office cleared the officer of any wrongdoing. Valencia is facing several felony charges for his alleged crime spree.
They are supposed to be the dream team who can solve the conundrum of how to win the election. But David Cameron and Boris Johnson were left scratching their heads today as they struggled with a children's jigsaw teaching toddlers about the seasons. As the London Mayor tried to hammer ill-fitting pieces together with his hands, the Prime Minister tried out what could be a new election slogan, telling him: 'If in doubt, wedge it in.' After being put right by a four-year-old who spotted their errors, the pair had more fun finger painting with Tory blue paint. David Cameron and Boris Johnson were left stumped by the puzzle at Advantage Children's Day Nursery in Surbiton, as three-year-old Stephanie looked on . When they tried to put the puzzle back together, they hit trouble after it proved to be more difficult than expected . The Conservative duo made their first appearance together on the campaign trail with a visit to Advantage day nursery in Surbiton, south west London. They were supposed to be highlighting Tory plans to double free childcare for 600,000 children aged three and four. They sat at a table with Joshua and Stephanie, both aged three, and four-year-olds Hamish and Leo where they broke up a puzzle which depicted the four seasons. When they tried to put it back together, they hit trouble after it proved to be more difficult than expected. After taking nine minutes to complete the puzzle, the Tory duo were relieved to try their hand at hand painting, which they found much easier . The pair were at the nursery in Surbiton to promote a Tory pledge to double free childcare for working parents of three and four-year-olds to 30 hours a week . Arriving at the nursery, Mr Cameron appeared to be giving Mr Johnson a ticking off before the visit had even started . Like a bad workman blaming his tools, Mr Johnson soon started to question whether there was a fundamental design fault. 'January is in winter,' he complained. 'There's something wrong with the puzzle.' The clock ticked on and Tory aides grew nervous, as Mr Cameron insisted: We've got all day.' Mr Johnson, fearing defeat, was adamant: 'We can't be beaten by the puzzle.' With the media crowding into classroom, Hamish asked Mr Cameron why there were so many journalists. 'If we finish the puzzle it will make them go away,' the PM said. But the children had spotted more errors. 'I've found another problem,' said Leo. Mr Johnson, already known as a political heavyweight, then tried brute force to get the pieces to fit by hammering them with his fist. He had the backing of the PM who declared: 'If in doubt, wedge it in.' Samantha Cameron got into less mess with blue paint during a visit to The Growing Zone allotment project in Kippax, West Yorkshire . Fearing it might be taking too long, and perhaps that the puzzle might get broken, a teacher then stepped in to point out yet more problems. 'This one is not right,' she said. 'This one goes there.' As the last piece went in to cheers - nearly nine minutes after they began - Mr Cameron initiated a group hug. 'Thank God for that. That was stressful,' he said. 'I do have to have a hug after that.' Mr Johnson joked: 'That was a bit like the (election) campaign ... suddenly, the final surge.' 'It all comes together in the end,' said Mr Cameron, before stopping one of the children taking the puzzle to pieces. 'Don't break it up again - I can't take the stress.' Afterwards the two men joined another group of children for a hand painting session - appropriately using blue paint.
This is the dramatic moments armed police swoop on a villa where a Briton linked to the gangland murder of a torture victim was arrested. Paul Monk, 54, from Essex, was wanted by Spanish police for questioning over the kidnap and murder of Francis Brennan, whose badly decomposed body washed up on a Costa Blanca beach in March last year. He was also wanted by the Metropolitan Police on drug offences and had been named on a list of fugitives published as part of the National Crime Agency's Operation Captura campaign ahead of his detention. This is the dramatic moment that fugitive Paul Monk was arrested by heavily armed police in his Alicante villa .

Taking no chances: The highly trained, well-armed police moved through the house room by room . Paul Monk was on the UK's most wanted list on suspicion of drug trafficking . Brennan, 25, from Liverpool, vanished in the resort of Javea in January last year after being kidnapped by men posing as police. His body was wrapped in an industrial-size bin bag with duct tape round it when it appeared on a beach in nearby Orihuela Costa. Civil Guard officers in Alicante confirmed today they believe Monk, from Essex, may be implicated in the violent death and named him as an associate of Paul Scott. Scott, 32, was arrested on a charge of conspiracy to import cocaine after being caught trying to sneak into Britain in a light aircraft last December. He was also wanted for questioning over Mr Brennan's murder when he was detained. Guardia Civil described him last night as the suspected mastermind of the crime. Monk was detained at a four-bedroom property in Javea near Alicante as he directed workers laying a marble patio around his swimming pool. An imitation firearm with a silencer and nearly £100,000 in cash were also found. He is being held in jail and is expected to be charged and face trial in Spain over Mr Brennan's murder before being extradited to the UK to face questioning over alleged drugs offences. He has been linked to the handover of one kilo of cocaine in Cockfosters, London, in May 2013 and the seizure of 24 kilos of cannabis in Colchester in October 2013. A Civil Guard spokesman said: 'He never left his house as a security measure to avoid being arrested. 'He got other people to bring him food and other things in the villa where he hid out, leading the life of an authentic fugitive.'

National Crime Agency detectives took part in the raid on the property along with Civil Guard officers. Mr Brennan, from Liverpool, was himself on the run after leaving Britain while awaiting sentence in the UK over the wounding of a man at a Swedish House Mafia music concert in Milton Keynes, Bedfordshire. He travelled to the Costa del Sol with his girlfriend towards the end of 2013 after ignoring the advice of his parents to stay in Britain. Police swooped on Scott last year after he flew from Holland to a remote airstrip in Norfolk. He had fake Belgian identity documents on him and more than £1,500 in cash. He was jailed in January for plotting to import 40 tonnes of cocaine into Britain. Police described him as the 'last man outstanding in a criminal gang that plotted to smuggle vast quantities of cocaine into the UK' after he was sentenced to 14 years in prison at Liverpool Crown Court.

Asbestos has been discovered in the roof at New York City's mayoral residence and work to remove the potentially cancer-causing materials from Gracie Mansion will begin this month. The hazardous material was discovered last month as crews prepared to replace the mayoral mansion's leaky roof. Officials do not believe the work poses any health risk to Mayor Bill de Blasio and his family, who will remain in the home during the renovation. Asbestos has been discovered in the roof at New York City's mayoral residence and work to remove the potentially cancer-causing materials from Gracie Mansion will begin this month . Mayor Bill de Blasio and First Lady Chirlane McCray hosting a black history month youth event at Gracie Mansion in February: The family expect to remain in the property during the building work . 'Gracie Mansion is one of Manhattan's oldest structures built more than 200 years ago and as with any older homes, maintenance is necessary,' mayoral spokesman Peter Kadushin said on Wednesday. 'Beginning this month Gracie Mansion will undergo asbestos abatement and some long-needed roof repairs.' The cost of removing the asbestos will be about $250,000 and the contract was awarded this week to Regional Management Inc., officials said. The replacement of the mansion 30-year-old roof, which is being done by Nicholson and Galloway, should cost an additional $3.4 million, officials said. The roof was frequently overmatched during rain storms, forcing city work crews to be dispatched to patch problem areas multiple times this winter, officials said. The two projects will be undertaken concurrently and should be completed by October or November, officials said. de Blasio poses with his son Dante (left), daughter Chiara (right), and wife Chirlane outside of their Park Slope home which the family had considered remaining in before moving to Gracie Mansion last July . A storage shed also is being built on the mansion's property. And officials said that about 10 of the building's windows were undergoing upgrades to become energy-efficient at the cost of another $13,000. De Blasio's predecessor, Michael Bloomberg, earmarked $3 million to the Parks Department capital budget in 2012 to replace the tired roof. Bloomberg never lived in the mansion during his 12 years in office — he instead opted to remain at his tony Upper East Side townhome — but oversaw extensive renovations to the home, which he used for meetings and ceremonial events. After considering remaining in his Brooklyn home, de Blasio, his wife and their two children moved into Gracie Mansion last July. The home, which is managed by the nonprofit Gracie Mansion Conservancy, was built in 1799, at which time it sat in the countryside more than five miles north of what was then a very small New York City. The mansion was seized by the city in 1896 after its owner failed to pay taxes. It became the official mayoral residence in 1942.

Nico Rosberg feels he may have handed Lewis Hamilton a psychological advantage with his post-Chinese Grand Prix outburst. Rosberg, however, concedes he would not do anything differently under the circumstances that materialised at the Shanghai International Circuit on Sunday. To make a complaint about Hamilton's slow driving was understandable given the situation, but to turn on his Mercedes team-mate during the post-race media conference was a sign the Briton has got under Rosberg's skin. Nico Rosberg has claimed that team-mate Lewis Hamilton has the mental edge over him after his outburst . Damon Hill, the 1996 world champion, upon hearing Rosberg's comments remarked the German had shot himself in the foot by publicly airing his grievances. It was a sign of weakness from Rosberg, who on Thursday conceded he had probably provided Hamilton with additional psychological ammunition. 'Maybe, because I'm standing here and I have to answer all these questions,' said Rosberg in the middle of a barrage from the press ahead of this weekend's Bahrain Grand Prix. 'But other than that, I would do it again because I felt the need to state the facts as there was a need to discuss things after that race. Everybody said that. 'That's it, I wouldn't do anything different, and except from being stood here in this room discussing it with you, it's a long time since I last discussed it. 'It's a thing of the past. I'm in Bahrain now and I'm here just to attack in a race car again. 'That's the best answer I can give, on the race track. I'm looking forward to it and that opportunity.' The British driver won the Chinese GP but came under fire from Rosberg for allegedly slowing on purpose . The matter was resolved in a post-race debrief involving the drivers and the team's top brass in motorsport boss Toto Wolff and executive technical director Paddy Lowe. But as to what would transpire should the same scenario occur again in the future, Rosberg said: 'It's so difficult because it's not a thing that's black or white. 'That's what makes all these scenarios difficult. Eventually, once the facts are analysed, there are still different opinions and it's going to be different from one race to the next.' Such a situation could become even more fluid should Ferrari manage to exert further pressure on Mercedes as the title race unfolds. Asked as to what the solution could be moving forward, the 29-year-old replied: 'It's always the same and it will not change. Damon Hill believes that Rosberg shot himself in the foot following his outburst about his Mercedes team-mate . 'It's an agreement we have when the team's one-two is under threat from another team then some management will be used to ensure that, and that might be at the disadvantage of one over the other. 'It becomes a team effort because we want to finish one-two and score the most possible points. 'So the more annoying a Ferrari becomes, the more likely those measures will be used - just like in China when Lewis was told to speed up.' Hamilton was publicly exonerated of any wrongdoing by Wolff and non-executive chairman Niki Lauda as he was merely controlling his pace at a point in the race when he was required to nurse his tyres. For his part, Hamilton has remained unruffled by Rosberg's comments, and does not feel there is any lingering animosity. 'We're moving forwards and we will reunite as a team this weekend and try to do a great job,' said Hamilton. Rosberg is yet to better Hamilton this season but insists he's already forgotten about their recent spat . 'There's no issue between me and Nico. We saw each other this morning and everything is good. 'There are going to be times when people are unhappy about some things, but we're grown-ups and we move past it.' There is no doubt Hamilton has Rosberg rattled as the former has now beaten the latter in nine of the last 10 races stretching back into last year. Rosberg knows he has to stop the rot, adding: 'It was very important to do that in Malaysia, and that was two races back, so that doesn't change. 'Every race is important, and he's 17 points ahead, so I need to get points back as soon as possible. That's clear, and it's not more important here or wherever. 'Last year he had a run of four wins at the beginning of the season, and right after that I had my best part of the year for quite a long time, so there's also that reference from last year.'
Having presumably grown used to being in the company of one famous Ronaldo, Real Madrid's teen sensation Martin Odegaard on Wednesday appeared to be left starstruck by another. The 16-year-old was pictured with former Brazil international Ronaldo as he paid a visit to the club he spent five years at during his illustrious playing career. Norway international Odegaard took to social media to share the picture of the pair at Real's Valdebebas training complex. Martin Odegaard poses with former Brazil international Ronaldo at the Real Madrid training ground . Odegaard celebrates after scoring for Real Madrid Castilla against Barakaldo in February . Zinedine Zidane (with Odegaard behind him, right) dropped the Norwegian from the Castilla side this month . The young midfielder was clearly in awe of the former World Cup winning striker and simply wrote 'legend' alongside the picture on Instagram. Ronaldo, who scored more than 100 goals for Real and netted an impressive 62 international goals, was visiting his old club ahead of their Champions League quarter-final second-leg clash against Atletico Madrid on Wednesday. Odegaard opted to join Real Madrid after courting interest from a host of top clubs in Europe, including Manchester United and Liverpool, and signed a long-term £40,000 a week contract with the Champions League winners in January. The former Stromgodset playmaker has trained with Carlo Ancelotti's first team regularly since his arrival, rubbing shoulder's with the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale. Odegaard is said to be on a different wave length to his Castilla team-mates because he rarely trains with them . The 16-year-old joined Real Madrid for £2.3million in January signing a long-term £40,000 a week contract . But the Norwegian wonderkid has found life tough at the Spanish giants in recent weeks. First team coach in waiting Zinedine Zidane dropped Odegaard from his Castilla side earlier this month after a dramatic downturn in results since his arrival. There have been suggestions that his presence in the side has riled team-mates that feel Odegaard training with the first team three times a week means he lacks cohesion in the B team. Real Madrid are desperate for the Castilla side to win promotion to the second tier of Spanish football and Zidane has to decide whether that goal is more attainable without the young talent.
It wasn't quite the Etihad or the Westfalenstadion but Sergio Aguero and Marco Reus went head-to-head in an exciting clash to showcase the new Puma boot being launched. The Manchester City star has been in good form this season despite his injury problems and showed his impressive close control against the Borussia Dortmund winger. The footwear brand are releasing the evoSPEED 1.3 Graphic, which took inspiration from the Japanese dragon. Sergio Aguero (left) and Marco Reus went head-to-head to help the launch the new Puma evoSpeed 1.3 . The Manchester City striker celebrates after scoring to put himself 3-2 up against the German . After the launch, Aguero sat down for a Q&A where he spoke about his side's chances of catching Chelsea. He said: 'You say it is only 5 matches, but a lot can happen in these games. We will work hard to finish as well as possible.' The Argentinian also praised his opponent for giving him a tough game during the unusual encounter. 'I have to admit, that guy is really talented, so my lead lasted unfortunately only a few seconds,' he added. 'I love this pitch and it's really fun, especially when playing against some new players who you don't get to meet every day in training.' The square pitch had four different goals that opened and closed to make it harder for the players . Reus has been heavily linked with a move away from Dortmund and could follow Jurgen Klopp out of the club . Germany international Reus also praised Aguero and really enjoyed playing on the difficult pitch. He said:  'I am sure you can see it in the film, but I can re-assure you that Agüero really gave me a hard time. He is so quick and so ambitious and it was definitely hard to keep up with him. 'The switching goals were challenging in the beginning, but once it clicked, it is a really cool concept, because you can never really anticipate what happens next. This was definitely one of the best things I have done with Puma so far.' You can buy the Puma evoSpeed 1.3 from www.prodirectsoccer.com.
Three generations of one family were saved from their car last week by a police officer seconds before the vehicle was pulled out to sea in Washington State. Peter Reece, his fiancee, baby daughter and mother from Kent were parked on an Ocean Shores beach on Thursday around 7pm in their new Nissan Infiniti when their tires got stuck in the sand. Reece told police that he and his family had been driving on the beach when they stopped on the edge of the surf to look at the water. Peter Reece, his fiancee, mother and six-month-old daughter were parked on an Ocean Shores, Washington, beach on Thursday when the tide came in and trapped the family . The wheels of the car sunk into the wet sand, so they were unable to move. Reece and his fiancee got out of the car, but his mother and daughter were trapped inside . In Ocean Shores there are roads that lead on to beach approaches, where drivers can go from road to beach. Reece and his family parked near the West Chance ala Mer beach approach. Reece said that the tide was 30 feet from where they were parked, but within a few minutes it had already reached so far up that it was hitting their car. The tires sunk into the wet sand and the family was unable to drive away, according to KXRO. 'There were waves coming back to back and crashing against the car like really loud and really hard,' Reece told Komo News. Reece and his fiancee were able to get out of the car, but the grandmother and child were stuck in the car because the wet sand surrounding them was keeping the doors shut. Seconds after Ocean Shores police officer Kyle Watson saved the grandmother and baby, a wave hit the car, flipping it and pulling it out to sea . The car was recovered shortly after the incident and a bulldozer was used to flip it on its right side before it was towed to the road . 'I was just trying to get us out as quickly as possible because I know when the tide gets higher it takes everything with it,' Reece said. Ocean Shores police  arrived on scene, finding Reece in the car with his mother and six-month-old baby, according to KBKW. Officer Kyle Watson had to force the door to the car open because the car had sunken so far into the wet sand. He helped the woman and baby out of the car and led them up the beach. Reece was able to get out on his own. They were only about 20 feet up the beach when another wave hit and lifted the car up into the water, flipping it on to its roof. 'And another wave hit and the car was on its top. So if we stayed in 30 second longer we would have been upside down,' Reece said. After being lifted up by the sea, the car eventually beached and had to be flipped by a bulldozer, before it was taken back to the road by a tow truck. Tow truck driver Christopher Macasieb, who helped get the car out of the sand, said that the car kept rolling on to its side because of the waves. In Ocean Shores there are roads that lead on to beach approaches, where drivers can go from road to beach, which is how the Reece family made their way to the surf . Police officer Paul Henderson said that because of the approaches, beached cars are not an uncommon problem in the city . 'It's unfortunate because it is a brand new car. But cars can be replaced. Lives cant,' he said. The Reece family, too, said they were grateful that all that was lost was the car. Ocean Shores officer Paul Henderson told Daily Mail Online that because there are beach approaches for people to drive on to, having cars get stuck in the sand is a somewhat common issue. 'You're allowed to park and drive on the beach within certain areas. Usually people are more aware of the tides,' Henderson said, adding that the Reece family was close to the surf. He said that some cars have gone out so far into the water that they have to be recovered at a later time. But the Reeces' car was recovered 'a short time later'. The car flipped on the Ocean Shores beach just before 7pm on Thursday. Henderson said that cars are allowed to drive and park on the sand in some areas of the beach . Police arrived on scene within minutes of getting a call about the trapped Reece family. The entire family was able to get out of the car before waves took the vehicle away .
Nicola Sturgeon was booed last night as she refused to rule out holding a second independence vote in the next few years – despite having earlier claimed 2014’s referendum was a ‘once in a generation’ event. Two years ago, Miss Sturgeon said of the independence vote: ‘We have always said it’s a once in a generation thing.’ But last night, in an election debate on Scottish TV, she said she respected last year’s result, and said she would not call for another plebiscite in the SNP manifesto for the Westminster election in May. Scroll down for video . Support: Asked by Mr Murphy (left) where she 'wanted' Mr Miliband to be prime minister, Ms Sturgeon (right) said: 'I'm offering to help make Ed Miliband prime minister. I don't want to see the Tories in Downing Street' Power: The result of the election this May is set to put Ms Sturgeon in a powerful position at Westminster, with the chance of choosing which party can form a government. Above, the SNP leader at tonight's debate . She said she would not rule out such a call in the manifesto for the 2016 Scottish Parliament election, saying: ‘That’s another matter.’ The admission sparked howls of derision from the audience. The Scottish first minister was accused of holding Britain to ‘ransom’ after she said she was ‘offering to make Ed Miliband prime minister’. She said she wanted to wanted to do a deal with Mr Miliband so she can influence the policies of a Labour government and keep it ‘honest’. Reacting to Miss Sturgeon’s offer to prop up Mr Miliband, Labour’s leader in Scotland, Jim Murphy, said: ‘Nicola, we don’t need your help. Reacting to Miss Sturgeon’s offer to prop up Mr Miliband, Labour’s leader in Scotland, Jim Murphy, said: ‘Nicola, we don’t need your help. ‘What we need is people north and south of the border, people in Scotland, people in England and people in across Wales coming together to kick out an out of touch government.’ He pleaded with the audience to claim that Labour can only beat the Conservatives if people vote for Mr Miliband in Scotland. ‘Only Labour is big enough, only Labour is strong enough to beat the Tories and their austerity,’ he said. Debate: From left to right, Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy, Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, First Minister and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon and Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie . Plan: Speaking in the debate for STV, Ms Sturgeon (right) said wanted Scots to vote SNP rather than Labour because 'we can make sure Labour keeps its promises'. Left, Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy . Grant Shapps, Conservative Party chairman said: ‘Tonight Nicola Sturgeon has promised that she’d prop up a minority Labour government – and hold Great Britain to ransom, vote by vote, policy by policy. ‘And that means more debt, higher taxes and the end of Trident – wreaking havoc on our economy and putting the security of British people and their families at risk. ‘Weak Ed Miliband doesn’t stand a chance. He’s in the pocket of Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon: and you’ll pay the price.’ The SNP is way ahead in the polls north of the border, and Labour is expected to lose dozens of seats in May’s election. The result is set to put Miss Sturgeon in a powerful position at Westminster, with the chance of choosing which party can form a government. She said she would never prop up a David Cameron government, but would help Mr Miliband get into Downing Street. But she said the polls showed that Labour could not beat the Tories on their own. Speaking in the debate for STV, Miss Sturgeon said wanted Scots to vote SNP rather than Labour because ‘if there’s a strong block of SNP MPs, we can make sure Labour keeps its promises. ‘Tony Blair was elected on a wave of hope and optimism, but his Labour government began the process of NHS privatisation. ‘I don’t want to see a Labour government simply implement Tory policies. Heading for success: The SNP is ahead in the polls north of the border, and Labour is expected to lose dozens of seats in the election. Above, Ms Sturgeon, second from right, during the debate tonight . ‘We need to send a strong team to make sure Labour get it; so we can keep Labour honest.’ She said: ‘We will work with Labour to keep David Cameron out of Downing Street. Labour is not offering an alternative to Tory austerity. ‘I stood on a platform last week in the UK leaders debate with Ed Miliband and I heard Miliband say if Labour is elected and left to their own devices there will be further spending reductions. ‘I don’t want to see further spending reductions, I don’t think the country can afford them. That’s why we’re proposing modest spending increases and with SNP influence we can force Labour down that path.' The Scottish first minister has already said offered to work with Labour to keep the Tories out of power if this is possible in a hung parliament. ‘I’ve said to Ed Miliband and I’ll say to Jim Murphy this evening, that if there is an anti-Tory majority in the House of Commons after the election, even if the Tories are the biggest party we will work with Labour to keep David Cameron out of Downing Street.’ Asked by Mr Murphy where she ‘wanted’ Mr Miliband to be prime minister, she said: ‘I’ don’t want David Cameron to be prime minister; I’m offering to help make Ed Miliband prime minister.’ Mr Murphy replied: ‘Nicola, we don’t need your help. ‘What we need is people north and south of the border, people in Scotland, people in England and people in across Wales coming together to kick out an out of touch government.’ He claimed he believe Labour would win, saying: ‘Even when my football team plays Barcelona, I don’t expect us to lose. ‘David Cameron ain’t no Lionel Messi – he can be beaten. ‘Any seat that Labour loses in Scotland reduces the chances of Ed Miliband becoming prime minister.’ Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson said the SNP’s position – urging Scots to vote against Labour and also promising to prop up a Labour government – was illogical. ‘Vote for what you want,’ she said. Audience members attending live political events occasionally catch the eye of the public. And last night was no different as a man wearing a fake moustache during the Scottish leaders’ debate caused Twitter to erupt. The man was filmed wearing a thick fake black moustache and large fedora hat as the four main political parties took part in a televised TV debate. Many social media users posted pictures of the blond-haired man on Twitter and questioned the authenticity of his facial hair. Others started a campaign to find the unnamed man and used the hashtag #moustacheman. The identity of the joker was later revealed as a man named as Danny McAfee, the father of Jack McAfee, who tweeted a picture of him without the disguise. A photo also emerged of the man posing with Nicola Sturgeon after the debate. Moustache man: The man, dressed in fake facial hair and a fedora, was spotted in the debate audience .

An Australian teenager has joined the puffy pout craze by using a shot glass to pump up her lips to ridiculous proportions. Violeta Tupuola, who lives near Canberra and already has naturally beautiful voluptuous lips, has joined the #kyliejennerchallenge sweeping social media of placing the opening of any narrow vessel over their mouth and sucking in until the vacuum of air causes their lips to excessively swell. In an attempt to emulate Kylie Jenner's bee-stung pout, Violeta got the shock of her life when she removed the shot glass and suddenly had such protruding lips that social media users compared her to a duck. Scroll down for video . In an attempt to emulate Kylie Jenner's bee-stung pout, Violeta  had such protruding lips that social media users have compared her to a duck . The response from one socail media user when watching Violeta's video was to post a photo of her with a duck . Violeta has joined the #kyliejennerchallenge by placing a shot glass over her mouth so the vacuum of air causes the lips to swell . The new craze is popular among teens desperate to emulate Jenner's famous plump lips (pictured) The video starts off with Violeta putting lip gloss on her already luscious lips before she suctioning the shot glass over her mouth. When she first saw the bizarre result, which is reportedly painful with the effect lasting up to hours, she gasped and put her hand to her mouth in disbelief of the strange look and began giggling. Violeta then took her  her hand away and exclaimed 'Oh my god! I can't even close my mouth' and then puts her hand over her mouth again while still laughing. She freaked herself out even further when after applying bright red lipstick which created a clown effect. The teen then began to pout and then reacted in a repulsed fashion saying 'ewwwwww' while touching her massive lips. Despite being quite alarmed by what she had created, Violeta seems to be impressed at the same time - wondering whether she could get the same effect to plump up her butt. 'Look how big it is - maybe I could do this to my a***!' then screws up her face and exclaims 'ewwwwww' yet again. Violeta freaked herself out with the bizarre look that is said to be painful and last hours . Despite being quite alarmed, Violeta wonders whether she could get the same effect to plump up her butt . Violeta shows off her  already naturally beautiful voluptuous lips before pulling the crazy stunt . Countless teens, both boys and girls, have been sharing the disturbing results of their experiments on Twitter and Instagram, which in many cases has led to severe bruising around the mouth. Surprisingly, given the sheer number of teens attempting the feat, it appears the results are far from desirable. 'I screwed up,' wrote one teenage girl along with her #kyliejennerchallenge selfie, while another complained she looked 'gross'. A worrying new trend dubbed the '#kyliejennerchallenge' is sweeping social media, encouraging teens to blow their lips up to epic proportions using bottles or shot glasses (pictured) 'Made my chin look like a hickey a week ago and I'll say I've never felt so dumb,' one disgruntled teen admitted. 'I did the #kyliejennerchallenge and my lips turned purple,' claimed yet another. The method - one this journalist won't be road-testing - works by way of the airlock created in the opening of the glass or jar, which increases blood flow to the lips and causes them to swell. Problematically, the results are said to last for hours, even days, with several people complaining that they were stuck with the after-effects for a lot longer than expected. The reportedly painful method involves participants placing their mouth over the opening of a cup, jar or shot glass and sucking in until the air vacuum causes their lips to swell up . Countless teens, both boys and girls, have been sharing the disturbing results of their experiments on Twitter and Instagram . Surprisingly, given the sheer number of teens attempting the feat, it appears the results are far from desirable . Plenty of Twitter users have been quick to ridicule the craze. 'Stop with that Kylie Jenner challenge it's so gross,' one wrote. 'I hate our generation. It's so dumb. Like you guys are really sticking your lips in small cups,' another ranted. 'Do people not realise they're bursting blood vessels?' another pointed out. The method works by way of the airlock created in the opening of the glass or jar, which increases blood flow to the lips and causes them to swell . Problematically, the results are said to last for hours, even days, with several people complaining that they were stuck with the after-effects for much longer than expected . Last month, two Icelandic sisters attempted the trick by sucking into a hairspray lid, and warned others against it after the stunt went disastrously wrong. Yrja Ás Baldvinsdottir, 18, and her sister, Bir­gitta Ás, from cReykjavik, were left with swollen and blue bruised lips. Writing on Facebook, Yrja As said: 'I wanted to warn people against do-it-yourself lip expansion, but was really surprised and shocked that it ended up being something that loads of people were copying. 'I just wanted to try it and see what they would look like, I've never done it before, and I won't be doing it again. It was very, very painful. My lips turned blue.' One boy expertly demonstrates just how extreme the effects can be if you try hard enough . Sore-looking red marks are visible around the lip line of this dejected experimenter . As for Kylie herself, the 17-year-old Kardashian clan member has recently denied artificially enhancing her lips, despite much speculation to the contrary. 'I haven't had plastic surgery,' she told Grazia Daily. 'I've never been under the knife. People flashback to pictures of me when I was 12 and say "Kylie's so different" but how can I look the same from 12 -18?' Plenty of Twitter users have been quick to ridicule the craze, labelling it 'dumb' and 'gross' 'I screwed up,' wrote one teenage girl along with her #kyliejennerchallenge selfie, while another complained she looked 'gross' We can only hope this particular trend dies out as fast as it gained steam .
Tiger Woods has been spotted hitting balls on the practice range at Augusta National, increasing hopes the former world No 1 will confirm his appearance at this year's first Major. Woods has not appeared on the PGA Tour since withdrawing from the Farmers Insurance Open on February 5 with a recurrence of his back problems. He has since taken a leave of absence in a bid to return to form, but there has been speculation he will return for the Masters, a tournament he has won four times. Tiger Woods was spotted practising at Augusta on Tuesday and is said to have returned to the course . Woods has dropped out of the top 100 for the first time in almost 19 years . Tiger Woods made his first appearance at the Masters as a 19-year-old back on April 3, 1995. Woods said he was not impressed by the iconic venue when he first drove through the gates. He said: 'When I first arrived here — Magnolia Lane, is that it? — I thought that it was a pretty short drive. 'From what everyone says, it’s majestic and a long drive, you can’t believe it, and this, that and the other.' Tiger played 18 holes at the course on Tuesday and insiders from the Golf Channel say he has now returned to the venue for a practice session. Woods did not play last year's Masters following back surgery - the first time he had missed the event since he first played it in 1995. On Monday, Woods dropped out of the top 100 in the world rankings for the first time in almost 19 years. The 14-time major winner did not record a top-10 finish in nine starts in 2014, and has missed three cuts and withdrawn twice in his last six Tour starts. Woods' last title came at the World Golf Championships-Bridgestone Invitational in August 2013. Woods, pictured driving off the 10th tee in April 1995, made his Masters debut 20 years ago . Woods has won the Masters on four separate occasions with his last win coming in 2005 .
This is the moment a young boy covered in blood was dragged from the scene of a devastating suicide bomb attack in Afghanistan. He was near a bank in Jalalabad early Saturday morning when the attacker detonated an explosive-laden motorcycle, killing 35 people and injuring another 125. The group, which included military personnel as well as civilians, were waiting to receive their monthly salaries as crowds bustled around them when the bomb exploded in the busy commercial district. Islamic State has since claimed responsibility for the attack, President Ghani said. Scroll down for video .

Another bomb was discovered close to the scene of the first explosion, police said. Two further blasts were reported. No injuries were reported from the first, which was near a shrine. The other, in the Behsud district, killed one civilian and wounded two others, Mr Abdulzai said. He added that a magnetic bomb had been attached to a parked car and then detonated by remote control. Four men - one talking on a mobile phone - survey a set of shattered windows near the scene. The force of the blast caused windows to break several miles away . A security official crouches down clutching a gun while others use radios to communicate as smoke clears from the street after the attack . A father kisses his son, who has a bandage round his head and is covered in dirt, and holds his hand to his mouth minutes after the blast . The Pakistani government, which is coordinating with Afghanistan on counter-terrorism issues, condemned the attacks. A statement released by the Pakistani Foreign Ministry labelled the bombings 'cowardly' and 'indiscriminate' and said there was no justification for attacks against civilians under any circumstances. Mr Ghani added that Islamic State was starting to establish a presence in Afghanistan. He used his visit to the United States last month to reiterate his concerns that the extremist group was making inroads into Afghanistan. 'If we don't stand on the same line united, these people are going to destroy us,' he told the 600 people gathered at the provincial government headquarters in Faizabad. The rise of even a small Islamic State affiliate could further destabilize the region and complicate U.S. and NATO efforts to end the 13-year Afghan war.
A married couple who have endured the heartbreak of ten miscarriages in ten years, have revealed the joy of becoming parents to their miracle daughter. Last year Sarah, 36, and Mark Brennan, 35, from south Wales, never gave up hope of becoming parents despite being told they'd never conceive naturally. Yet last September they defied doctors to have Eryn, who was born seven weeks early, weighing just 3lb 11oz. Sarah and Mark Brennan show off their longed-for daughter Eryn Elisabeth . Sarah, a project manager, said: 'We'd just been put on the waiting list for IVF, when I had an inkling I might be pregnant.' After feeling queasy and exhausted, she decided to take a pregnancy test, which confirmed that she was expecting. Mark, a technician, said: 'It was wonderful to find out that Sarah was pregnant, but after so many miscarriages, we could not help but worry.' The pair, who met when they were 18, were just about to jet off to Egypt for a holiday and quickly booked themselves in for a private scan. Mark said: 'It may sound strange, but after about six miscarriages, we just got used to it - to being let down every time.' During their holiday, Sarah continued to suffer from sickness and giddiness and went straight to the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend when they returned home. Project manager Sarah, pictured with her treasured daughter, advises other mums struggling with infertility to not give up . After telling the midwife their history they were referred to the sonographer and a scan revealed a heartbeat. 'We couldn't stop the tears - we were in pieces. We even had the sonographer in tears,' Sarah said. In the weeks that followed, the pair were told that their baby was developing well and found out at the 20-week scan that they were expecting a girl. Everything went smoothly until 29 weeks, when Sarah's waters broke so early, the doctors did not believe they had gone. She recalled: 'I was in a state of panic. But they hooked me up to machines to check her and, thank God, she was OK.' Sarah was told that she was experiencing Braxton Hicks - a tightening of the muscles in the womb - and sent home. The couple then spent the next few days in and out of hospital. 'Fear was creeping back into both of us,' she said. 'In fact, scared just isn't the word.' The doctors eventually confirmed that her waters had broken and she was sent to a specialist unit at Singleton Hospital in Swansea for close monitoring. After going into labour early, Sarah feared she'd lost Eryn and couldn't hold her newborn for five hours . 'I was in agony with the pain of every baby kick, stretch, minor movement or hiccup,' she said. Sarah spent the next two weeks in hospital, but did not go into labour and decided to go home. She eventually went into labour on September 30 and was booked in for an emergency Caesarean, as the baby was in the breech position. Eryn was born at 33 weeks at the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend at 2.52pm, weighing just 3Ib 11oz. Sarah said: 'She let out a cry and we were in tears - we were finally parents. But instead of handing her to me, the midwife raced away because she needed help breathing. 'I didn't get to see her until five hours after she was born and the first cuddle, with wires and tubes, was not until the next day.' The couple decided to call their daughter Eryn Elisabeth. The couple said they became 'used' to the heartbreak of miscarriages after losing ten babies . Sarah said: 'I was handed Eryn, complete with tubes and wires, and I crumbled with a perfect rush of emotion and love.' Sarah was discharged from hospital, but Eryn had to stay in neonatal care for three weeks. 'It was terrifying to leave her,' she said. 'We spent all day by her cot and I was in tears every night.' The pair eventually returned to their home in Llantwit Major and Eryn is now growing well. Sarah said: 'We were so happy - I would say to anyone else who is going through the same thing - never give up hope.'
Former captain of the fictional Star Trek Enterprise, William Shatner has proposed a radical method to solve California’s ongoing drought disaster. He is planning to run a Kickstarter campaign and is hoping to raise $30 billion (£20 billion) to build a pipeline from Seattle to bring water to the state. But the proposal to build a pipeline hundreds of miles long has been declared 'highly illogical' by some experts. Scroll down for video . Former captain of the fictional Star Trek Enterprise, William Shatner (pictured) has revealed radical proposals in an interview with Yahoo News. He wants to build a 4ft-wide pipeline from Seattle down to California to transport water and solve the state's ongoing drought problem . He revealed the crowdfunding campaign in an interview with David Pogue from Yahoo News. Mr Shatner likened his project to a similar pipeline in Alaska - with, in this case, the pipeline running from Seattle to California down the I-5 highway. Since the year 2000, seven western states in the US has seen their driest periods in centuries: Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming. And scientists in California have warned that the region may be experiencing a century-long 'mega-drought'. The warnings came after sediment studies showed California is currently experiencing the driest spell since 1580, and that the regular rainfall seen during the last century is likely to have been a temporary deviation in a cycle of droughts and very occasional rainfall over the last 3,000 years. In 2013, California received less rain than in any year since its formation as a state in 1850. And the last four years have seen the worst conditions, with the entire state of California now declared to be experiencing a drought. The pipeline would reportedly be used to fill one of the rapidly drying lakes in California. He said Seattle was ‘a place where there’s a lot of water’ - although its state, Washington, is also experiencing a major drought. Without going into specifics, Mr Shatner added he would need a ‘large, four-foot pipeline’ above ground to keep enough water flowing. On his website though, Shatner’s Water, he is letting people suggest other ideas for what to do with the money - if the campaign is successful. If he doesn’t get the funding he requires, Mr Shatner says he will give the money he raises to a politician. However, Kickstarter doesn’t allow campaigners to keep any money if they don’t reach their target, so Mr Shatner may need to use a site such as Indiegogo instead, which does. The funding campaign has not yet launched and cynics have suggested that the proposal was tongue-in-cheek, or may have been a joke. On Twitter, Mr Shatner responded to some of these comments by posting: ‘I know I need experts and @algore and @elonmusk should be asked to weigh in and join the conversation,’ he said. And responding to complaints that Washington was also experiencing a severe drought, he said: ‘I think [Washington] folks are thinking I’m coming in with football field sized sponges in the middle of the night to steal their water.’ The ongoing drought is one of California's worst in history. The last four years have seen the worst conditions, with the entire state of California now declared to be experiencing a drought said the US Department of Agriculture. This graphic shows the areas that have been hit the worst . Without going into specifics, Mr Shatner said he would need a ‘large, four-foot pipeline’ above ground to keep enough water flowing. On his website Shatner’s Water, he is also letting people suggest other ideas for what to do with the money - if the campaign is successful. One of the alternative proposals is pictured . California has had to drastically cut back on water use to deal with the four-year drought that continues to cause devastation. But the Washington Department of Ecology spokesman Dan Partridge said that Mr Shatner’s plan was not necessarily the solution they needed. ‘Frankly we found it highly illogical, to put it in “Star Trek” terms,’ he said. ‘This would involve so many obstacles, so many hurdles that it would have to overcome to become reality. ‘Namely the water of Washington state, you have to acquire a number of rights to use that water and we would not be approving transfer of a huge volume of water out of our state at this point in time when we have a drought of our own to deal with.’ Bone dry: A Californian farmer is pictured surveying his drought-hit land in San Luis Obispo County .
CCTV footage of the devastating moment a man put his brother in a coma with a single punch has been released for the first time, with the brother responsible soon to learn if he will serve prison time. Downing Centre Local Court showed the security footage of the violent altercation between Irishman Barry Lyttle and his younger brother, Patrick, during a sentence hearing on Wednesday. Prosecutor Alex Poulos called for Barry, from Belfast in Ireland's north, to face a full-time jail term as it was the 'only appropriate sentence' after the violent incident in Sydney in January. Scroll down for video . After being pushed by Patrick Lyttle, his brother retaliates with a single punch (left) which causes his brother to fall to the ground, his head snapping back and body crumpling (right) Barry Lyttle has been charged with grievous bodily harm and has pleaded guilty to the charge . Magistrate Graeme Curran said a jail sentence was likely, explaining 'the issue is whether or not I suspend a prison term'. Barry could spend up to two years in a Sydney jail, despite his brother's calls for the charges to be dropped. On Thursday, security footage was shown for the first time, revealing the details of the distressing altercation outside Hugo's Lounge in Sydney's Potts Point when Patrick received a single blow to the head during an argument with his brother Barry. In court on Thursday, Patrick comforted his inconsolable brother as they watched the footage. Before the fight the brothers, who had only been reunited for a holiday in Australia for a matter of days, are seen chatting jovially and patting each other on the back affectionately. But after leaving the bar a fight escalated quickly. The court saw footage of the brothers standing nose-to-nose, exchanging some tense words. As Barry starts to walk away from the argument, Patrick pushes his big brother roughly. Patrick was treated by paramedics at the scene where he was found in a pool of blood and vomit on January 3 . Patrick Lyttle (middle) has called on charges against his brother Barry (left) to be dropped . The brothers from Belfast in Ireland (pictured here as children) went on a night out on January 3 in Kings Cross . Mr Lyttle pleaded guilty after the crown declined to downgrade the charge against him . The Irishman could learn his fate as soon as Thursday afternoon when the matter returns to court for a possible sentencing hearing . A split second later, Barry retaliates with a brutal punch to Patrick's head. It is a distressing scene as Patrick's head snaps back from the force of Barry's blow. His body buckles beneath him and he crumples to the ground, his head slamming against the pavement. As Patrick lies unresponsive on the ground, a clearly-distressed Barry immediately rushes to his brother's side, frantically trying to revive him. Patrick nearly lost his life after suffering traumatic head injuries. He was found by emergency services in a pool of blood and vomit, and remained in a coma at Sydney's St Vincent's Hospital for six days after the January 3 altercation. Patrick says he has since made a 'fantastic recovery.' Barry pleaded guilty to recklessly causing grievous bodily harm, whilst his brother called for the charges to be dismissed. Barry Lyttle (pictured left) has pleaded guilty to causing his brother Patrick (right) grievous bodily harm . The Lyttle family has previously said they believe the charge against Barry (centre) should be dropped . Patrick Lyttle (right) said he had made a 'fantastic recovery' On Thursday, Patrick delivered an impassioned victim's statement, pleading for Barry to be spared a prison sentence and for the family to be allowed to return to Ireland together to 'heal'. 'When my family is healed I will be healed,' Patrick Lyttle told the court. 'It has been an awful ordeal for me but everyone can see it has been for Barry too. 'Victims often want to see deterrence. But everyone can see how much my brother has suffered.' Patrick also pointed out their father Oliver's health has greatly suffered as a result of the trauma. Their father was in Australia with the two men on what had intended as a trip of a lifetime, but has become a nightmare. Barry Lyttle is pictured arriving at court with his brother, Patrick, and his girlfriend, Patricia last week . 'He doesn't want to go home without his two sons,' Patrick said. Patrick asked the court to consider allowing Barry to return to Ireland so the brothers can embark on a career in youth work, telling young people their story to warn of the dangers of violence. Barry's lawyer Chris Watson said his client was remorseful, unlikely to re-offend and of good character. The 33-year-old will be sentenced in Sydney's local court, where the maximum jail term is two years, rather than the district court, where people could face up to 10 years for that offence. Barry Lyttle's barrister Chris Watson said the punch was a 'very emotional, spur of the moment act' that immediately followed being aggressively attacked by his brother, and that Barry Lyttle had immediately shown 'an extreme level of contrition and remorse', according to the Sydney Morning Herald. Any animosity between the two has since gone and they walked from court together on Thursday, as they have done at earlier appearances. Barry will return to court for sentencing on April 24.

A California judge has reduced a child rapist's mandatory 25-year sentence down to only 10 - saying anything longer would be 'cruel and unusual punishment'. Superior Court Judge M. Marc Kelly told an Orange County jury that 20-year-old Kevin Jonas Rojano-Nieto 'did not intend to harm' the three-year-old girl he raped at his family home in June. The judge said that he was sure that although Rojano-Nieto sodomized the girl and covered her mouth so she couldn't scream out, 'there was no violence or callous disregard for the victim's well-being'. Controversial: Superior Court Judge M. Marc Kelly (seen here with a colleague in 2010) has handed a 10-year sentence to a 20-year-old child rapist. The mandatory sentence should be 25-years to life . Judge Kelly also said Rojano-Nieto, 'inexplicably became sexually aroused but did not appear to consciously intend to harm the victim.' Prosecutor have said they will appeal the controversial decision and will be pushing for the minimum sentence of 25-years to life to be reinstated. Rojano-Nieto was found guilty on December 3 of raping the girl who wandered into a garage where he was playing video games. According to the court news service, Rojano-Nieto said he became aroused by the girl and pulled her pants down to rape her during the sickening attack. While this was going on, he could apparently hear her mother calling out for her, so covered her mouth so she couldn't scream back. The girl told her mother after the assault that she was in pain and her mother called the police who found injuries consistent with rape. Rapist: Kevin Jonas Rojano-Nieto has been sentenced to 10-years behind bars for the rape of a 3-year-old girl . “Although serious and despicable, this does not compare to a situation where a pedophilic child predator preys on an innocent child,” Superior Court Judge M. Marc Kelly said according to KTLA. Deputy District Attorney Whitney Bokosky said she disagrees and will appeal. She said that Rojano-Nieto knew what he was doing was wrong because he covered the girl's mouth during the rape so she couldn't call out.
Jose Mourinho has said Diego Costa's recovery from a hamstring injury is going well and the striker could return for next weekend's Premier League showdown with Arsenal. Costa sustained the injury in the 2-1 home win over Stoke City on April 4 and was expected to be out for a month. But his recovery has been quicker than expected and the 19-goal frontman will rejoin the squad for training next week. Jose Mourinho offered some positive injury news as he spoke ahead of Chelsea's game with Man United . Costa injured his hamstring in the win over Stoke City at Stamford Bridge on April 4 . Mourinho hinted that Loic Remy should return from a calf injury against Manchester United . Chelsea currently enjoy a seven-point lead in the Premier League title race with a game in hand . April 18 Manchester United (H) April 26 Arsenal (A) April 29 Leicester City (A) May 3 Crystal Palace (H) May 10 Liverpool (H) May 18 West Bromwich Albion (A) May 24 Sunderland (H) Speaking ahead of Chelsea's home clash with Manchester United on Saturday night, Mourinho said: 'Diego is progressing very well, I think he has a chance for next weekend. 'Our target for him was to play the last four matches. Arsenal is the sixth from the end, so if he doesn't play against Arsenal or Leicester, it is not a problem because we were always focusing on the last four. 'But thing are going so well he has a chance [of facing Arsenal]. He's training, he starts training with the rest of the squad next week.' Mourinho also said that Loic Remy has recovered from a calf injury and could return against United. The Blues currently have a seven-point lead at the top of the table and still have a game in hand over Arsenal.
One of Australia’s most prestigious race days, the opening of The Championships, has been postponed after wild weather left Randwick Racecourse unsafe to compete on. Stewards announced it was too risky to race on the wet surface after an early inspection at around 9.30am Saturday morning, disappointing the 25,000 punters officials expected to show. Under normal circumstances the Australian Turf Club would've been packed with punters dressed to the nines scrambling for a seat, but as early racegoers Susie Pleasance and Helen Quarrel learned, the field was absolutely empty. Racegoers Susie Pleasance and Helen Quarrel got to the field early and were disappointed to find an empty track . With a logistical nightmare on their hands, officials opted to move the $10 million program to Monday allowing racegoers to use the ticket they purchased for the Saturday event. Ticket-holders who won't be able to make Monday's event will be giving the option of receiving a refund . Chief steward Ray Murrihy said officials could’nt be confident they could get through the whole meeting after the turf took on so much rain. "We galloped two horses on it at six o'clock this morning and have had 25 millimetres since.’ "The surface was water logged and the radar was horrendous. We might have got through one or two, but to get through 10 races with big fields would have been a miracle so we will wait for Monday,’ he added. With grey clouds hanging over the track and no sign of rain easing officials said the the turf was too dangerous to compete on . The Championships opening day has been moved to Monday with punters being given the option of a refund if they don't want to attend the event at the revised time . The Warwick Farm card is unable to go ahead on Monday and will be moved to Wednesday, with the Wednesday program being totally abandoned. The gourmet food and wine event launched at last years Championships called Little Sydney will not go ahead on Monday with ticket-holders being offered a full refund. There is some good news for three-year-old superstars Sweynesse and Kermadec who will now be elevated into the $3 million Doncaster Mile after reports that all scratching’s will be restored. Official's are unsure if the 25,000 punters expected to show on Saturday will return for the Monday event .
As composed and as comfortable as Manchester City were here at the Etihad, performances like this succeed only in highlighting the full extent of their failure this season. In Sergio Aguero they boast the joint leading scorer in the Barclays Premier League. Here against West Ham he scored his 20th of the campaign. And in David Silva and Jesus Navas, not to mention a seemingly revitalised Yaya Toure, they had players far too accomplished for the quality of this opposition. But such a dominant, determined display must leave the club’s owners wondering why on earth this was only their third win in nine games after a run of six defeats in their previous eight. Why, even when West Ham were as abject as they were until City lost Silva to serious injury, they have been unable to play with such confidence more frequently.

Presumably a victory that strengthens City’s position among the Champions League places, on a weekend when Manchester United lost, eases the pressure on Manuel Pellegrini. But there is sure to remain a fair amount of frustration in Abu Dhabi that the last few months have proved so problematic. By the end of this encounter the greater, more pressing, concern was for the welfare of Silva. Injured from what both managers agreed was an accidental elbow in the face from Cheikhou Kouyate midway through the second half, the Spanish international required oxygen before leaving the pitch on a stretcher after eight minutes of treatment. He was then taken to hospital. But other problems nevertheless remain for City’s manager Pellegrini when he had to wake to headlines being generated by the notoriously vocal agent of Toure, who reportedly accused the Chilean of being ‘a weak manager’ as well as criticising other prominent members of the club hierarchy, too. Pellegrini was asked to respond but declined to comment. With managers such as Jurgen Klopp now available for hire, these stories are poorly timed for Pellegrini. But he can at least take comfort in the way his team responded to that crushing defeat at Old Trafford the previous weekend. ‘After two defeats in a row it was a very important win,’ added Pellegrini.

Aleksandar Kolarov goes down under the challenge of West Ham defender Carl Jenkinson in the penalty area but was only awarded a corner . With another match here at home coming next, against Aston Villa, City’s manager is sure to be encouraged by the form of Aguero. Until Sunday he had failed to score a Premier League goal from open play at the Etihad since November 2. But the goal he scored in this contest was neatly taken; much more like the striker City’s subdued supporters have grown to admire. He thrived on the possession City were enjoying — 75 per cent for the first 15 minutes — and joined Silva and Alek-sandar Kolarov in threatening West Ham’s goal early on. City’s opening goal, scored after 18 minutes, was an absolute horror for West Ham. First came Aaron Cresswell’s failure to win an aerial contest with the diminutive Navas, and then a spectacular own goal from James Collins.

In trying to intercept a cross from Navas, the West Ham centre half succeeded only in scoring with a sliced volley, the ball spinning off his boot and over the head of Adrian before flying home via the underside of the crossbar. If it was a little unfortunate for the visitors it remained a product of the pressure City were exerting. A West Ham side probably unsettled by the uncertainty surrounding their own manager offered little in return. Carlton Cole almost seized on a mistake from Martin Demichelis only for Joe Hart to block his shot, while City’s goalkeeper then marked his 28th birthday by denying Enner Valencia.

The Manchester City players celebrate having taken an early lead at the Etihad on Sunday against West Ham during the Premier League clash . The control nevertheless remained with City, a second goal arriving in the 36th minute after Toure had regained possession from Stewart Downing. A rapidly executed counter-attack followed, with Aguero and Navas combining impressively before Aguero slotted home his 101st Manchester City goal. In the dug-out Sam Allardyce appeared thoroughly hacked off, and understandably so given the ineptitude of his defenders and his side’s lack of ambition going forward. He responded at the start of the second half by pushing Valencia into a more attacking role alongside Cole. But it was City who continued to press, with Adrian doing well to deny Aguero a second. The injury to Silva — earning Kouyate a yellow card despite the fact that it really didn’t look intentional — disrupted City’s rhythm and gave West Ham a little encouragement. Downing went close, as did Valencia. But to no avail. For once Pellegrini had reason to feel a touch more secure.

A 13-year-old girl has been gunned down by ISIS snipers in the Syrian capital of Damascus as she tried to flee a militant-held area of the city, according to reports. The teenager, identified as Zeynab Daghastani, was shot and killed as she made her way through the southern streets of the Al-Yarmouk Camp towards the nearby neighbourhood of Yalda. Zeynab was shot dead on the evening of April 7 last week according to a worker at the Jafra Foundation, an aid organisation working in the area. Zeynab Daghastani, 13, was reportedly gunned down by ISIS snipers in Al-Yarmouk Camp, on the outskirts of Damascus, as she fled the militants (pictured, Islamic State fighters as they captured the camp ten days ago) According to relief workers in the area, Zeynab was killed on Tuesday as she tried to make her way from Yarmouk to a nearby neighbourhood controlled by the Syrian Army (pictured, ISIS fighters in Yarmouk) The worker, named only as Nina, also revealed that activists and relief workers were also being targeted by ISIS, according to the IBTimes. Nina told the publication that she had got the information from Aknaf Bait al-Maqdis, a Palestinian rebel group who are trying to recapture Yarmouk from ISIS. Thousands of Palestinians have been trying to escape Yarmouk since the area fell under ISIS control on April 4, leaving 200 people dead in seven days, including children who were slaughtered in front of their parents. Around 160,000 Palestinians used to live in Yarmouk, just a few miles from the palace of president Bashar Al-Assad, but many fled after his regime began bombing the neighbourhood in 2012 during the Arab Spring uprisings. The district was soon surrounded and food, water, and electricity supplies were all cut off, with around 18,000 residents still trapped inside. Around 18,000 Palestinians have been under siege in Yarmouk since 2012, before ISIS fighters moved in earlier this month. Since then thousands more have fled, while many who remained have been killed . Those who have managed to escape Yarmouk since ISIS captured it have told of militants playing football in the streets with severed heads, and children killed in front of their families . The plight of those in Yarmouk was brought to international attention in February last year when the United Nations Relief and Works Agency finally managed to bring much-needed aid to the area. Hundreds of civilians were pictured packing the bombed-out streets, desperately trying to get their hands on and food available. It was estimated that, before the UN workers arrived, the average resident of Yarmouk was living on 400 calories a day, less than a quarter of the daily recommended amount. It was reported at the time that some had taken to eating stray cats and dogs in desperation, all while being shelled and bombed by Assad's troops. Their situation became even more dire at the start of this month when ISIS stormed the camp. Around 2,500 people managed to flee before the assault took place, but many were left behind, trapped when ISIS posted snipers in the tallest buildings surrounding the southern neighbourhoods. The plight of those trapped in Yarmouk came to light in February last year when UN aid workers were allowed in after years of siege conditions, and hundreds flooded the streets in search of food . Since ISIS seized control of around 70 per cent of the Yarmouk Camp, tales of their barbarity have leaked out as other Palestinians managed to escape their clutches. Amjad Yaaqub, 16, said he found Islamic State troops playing football with the severed head of a Palestinian rebel fighter they had executed. The teenager said he stumbled upon the scene after being beaten unconscious by fanatics hunting for his brother, a resistance fighter. When he woke up he walked outside his home and found the gruesome scene taking place. Other residents have also told of the fighters' barbarity. Abdel Fatah, 55, said: 'I saw severed heads. They killed children in front of their parents. We were terrorised. 'We had heard of their cruelty from the television, but when we saw it ourselves... I can tell you, their reputation is well-deserved.'
Laura Robson took the opportunity to cool down in the Florida heat on Thursday while she dipped in an ice bath as the British tennis nears a return to action after more than a year off the court. The 21-year-old has not played since the 2014 Australian Open more than 15 months ago after requiring surgery on an injured wrist. But Robson, who has been training in Tampa in a bid to build up her fitness in time to take part in next month's French Open at Roland Garros. Laura Robson used an ice bath as a means of cooling down in the Florida heat as she nears a return to action . Laura Robson (centre) shared a picture on Instagram of her at Tortuga festival with two friends . The former British No 1 was pictured sitting in an ice bath after a practice session and shared the picture on social media. 'No issues with ice baths when it's this hot in Florida,' Robson wrote on Facebook. The latest social media update comes days after Robson spent time relaxing at country music festival Tortuga. Robson's last appearance came in the 2014 Australian Open first round where she lost in straight sets . Robson (left) had to wear a protective cast last year but tweeted a picture back on the court last month . The 21-year-old shared a photo on Instagram of her soaking up the sun with two friends and captioned the image 'Country music is the best music #tortuga.'

London Midland has vowed to give police CCTV images of a 'disgusting' passenger suspected of defecating inside a train carriage as it travelled through the Birmingham area. The passenger who made the awful discovery said the smell was so bad that it forced the operator to cancel the service from Lichfield Trent Valley to Longbridge. It plunged commuters into hours of misery as the act of vandalism on the Cross City line caused severe delays. A passenger made the awful discovery on a train travelling between Lichfield Trent Valley and Longbridge . Passenger Christopher Talbot told the Birmingham Mail he was heading to work on the 7:50am service on Thursday when he found  excrement in a newspaper on the floor. He said: ‘As I sat down I saw a newspaper on the floor. I leaned over and noticed there was something inside it. ‘It looked like poo basically. The smell was going through the carriage. These trains have toilets on.’ The 52-year-old, who works as a cleaner at a school, said there was only one other passenger in the carriage, and he reported the incident to platform staff when he disembarked at Butlers Lane in Four Oaks. London Midland said that CCTV images of the culprit would be passed onto police for investigation . The service terminated at Birmingham New Street so that the carriage that was used as a toilet could be cleaned. Normal service resumed at about 9:30am. A Network Rail spokeswoman confirmed to MailOnline Travel that excrement was discovered inside a carriage. A spokesman for London Midland said the 'act of vandalism' was 'disgusting'. The service terminated at Birmingham New Street so that the carriage could be cleaned . He added: ‘It was necessary for the train to be cleaned before we could continue to let passengers onto the service. ‘I would like to apologise to our genuine passengers who experienced the disruption.’ London Midland confirmed that CCTV images of the culprit, who fled the train, would be passed onto police for investigation. A British Transport Police spokeswoman told MailOnline Travel that it has no record of a formal complaint being filed. A similar incident occurred last month when a British Airways flight was forced to return to London after a foul odour emanated from an overflowing toilet. Passenger Abhishek Sachdev, a councillor who represents Potters Bar Parkfield, said the seven-hour flight to Dubai was aborted ‘because of a smelly poo in the toilet'.
Confusion over Ukip’s immigration policy grew yesterday after Nigel Farage called for the number of arrivals into Britain to be limited at 50,000 a year. But at the same time he claimed that overall caps on net migration – as pledged by the Tories – would be ‘ludicrous’ because it was impossible to stop people leaving the country. Ukip’s manifesto chief later added to the confusion by saying the 50,000 limit ‘might change every year’. Confusion over Ukip’s immigration policy grew yesterday after Nigel Farage called for the number of arrivals into Britain to be limited at 50,000 a year . The Conservatives accused Mr Farage of ‘making up his policies as he goes along’ – but Mr Farage has denied his party has made any U-turns on immigration. Ukip first unveiled an immigration cap in February, with spokesman Stephen Woolfe saying the numbers being granted visas limited at 50,000. But at the start of March, Mr Farage overturned this by saying he would not set ‘arbitrary targets’. At the end of the month, the Ukip leader spoke of a net migration limit of ‘about 30,000 people a year’. Charlie Elphicke, the Tory candidate in Dover, said: ‘Ukip’s immigration policy doesn’t just change by the day, it changes by the minute in the space of one interview. It’s complete chaos. ‘The truth is with Nigel Farage, you just don’t know what you’re going to get. The only certainty is that a vote for Ukip lets Ed Miliband limp into Downing Street via the backdoor - and then there will be no action on immigration.’ Interviewed on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme yesterday, Mr Farage said about his party’s cap: ‘It’s below 50,000 a year, all right? It’s below 50,000 a year. Simple as that. The Conservatives accused Mr Farage of ‘making up his policies as he goes along’ – but Mr Farage has denied his party has made any U-turns on immigration . ‘But this whole debate we’ve been tied up with caps for five years. It’s devalued the debate. What we’re not actually addressing is the fact that 624,000 people settled in Britain last year and that we have no control over the numbers that settle this year or next year. ‘Let’s be honest, we cannot have any debate about immigration about numbers while we’re members of the European Union.’ Later in the day, Suzanne Evans, Ukip’s manifesto chief, said the level of the cap might change. She told the BBC News channel: ‘If we say, we have 21,000 highly skilled people coming from outside of the EU, where there is already a points based system, then we will talk to the businesses, that’s where we get our 50,000 limit from, but that might change every year.’
Alan Davey controversially laid bare the difficulties of the station's top job in an interview on Radio 4's Feedback programme . The controller of BBC Radio 3 has branded audiences ignorant and claims broadcasting classical music has become more challenging as a result. Alan Davey controversially laid bare the difficulties of the station's top job in an interview on Radio 4's Feedback programme. Mr Davey was asked about changes to general classical music knowledge over the last 30 years. He said: 'If you look back at the Third Programme (the original name for Radio 3), they were bringing high culture to a relatively mass audience but they could assume that their audience knew everything. 'They did not need to have the ins and outs of classical music explained to them. 'The modern audience might not be getting the same education in music in school as they might have done a few years ago – not consistently so, anyway. 'We have to perhaps offer more explanation and context for works. 'It's not lowering the standard, it's not making the content simple. It's about how we present it.' Mr Davey, who until January was chief executive of Arts Council England, added: 'I believe there are different ways to draw people into music. 'There's the Classic FM way, and they're very good at that. 'We'll be presenting more longer pieces and greater variety of composers, and we also provide the additional different kinds of music and the cultural commentary throughout.' The station has been accused of 'dumbing down' in the past, especially after a drive in 2011 to make it more 'accessible' to a broader audience. Last year Mr Davey's predecessor Roger Wright (above) dismissed as 'complete nonsense' claims that the station was dumbing down . With just two million listeners, Radio 3 is the least listened-to of the BBC's main stations. Last year Mr Davey's predecessor Roger Wright dismissed as 'complete nonsense' claims that the station was dumbing down and said there were distinct differences between the stations. He said: 'I just don't recognise it at all. Apparently we do phone-ins? We don't. 'We haven't had a request show for a long, long time. You do hear one listener voice on the breakfast show suggesting a piece of music — that's not exactly a phone-in. So it's complete nonsense.'
This is the extraordinary moment a brave hippopotamus stood its ground against two hungry lions and managed to send them on their way after charging towards them. These incredible pictures show the hungry three-year-old big cats attempting to hunt the much larger hippo in the depths of Zimbabwe's Hwange National Park. At first, as the lions approach the large mammal, the hippo tries to scare them off before wandering towards nearby water. However, as the lions continue to prowl, the animal abruptly turns around and charges towards the two predators, successfully scaring them off before retreating to its territory. Scroll down for video . The brave hippopotamus could be seen standing its ground against the young lions in the depths of Zimbabwe's Hwange National Park . The hippo attempted to scare off the three-year-old lions as they tried to attack the mammal at the nature reserve in the west of Zimbabwe . The large hippo waits until the lions appear to back down before attempting to turn around and retreat towards some nearby water . The hippopotamus makes its way into some muddy water while the lions look on, but the dramatic altercation is far from over yet . The dramatic altercation was caught on camera by researcher Brent Stapelkamp, who has been studying the activities and behaviour of lions in the Zimbabwean reserve for years. The 37-year-old said: 'The two male lions in the photos are just three-years-old and left their pride a few days before these shots were taken. 'As far as we can tell they have not eaten anything since they left and this incident was probably their first try at self-catering. 'The lions attempted to catch the large calf, but the hippo quickly ran to the safety of the water. 'As the lions walked away the cocky hippo showed them who is boss and charged right back at the two cats causing them to scatter.' As the lions continue to taunt the hippo, the large mammal turns around and charges out of the water towards the two young lions . The stand-off was caught on camera by researcher Brent Stapelkamp, who has been studying the behaviour of lions in the area for years . The three-year-old lions, who may be trying to land their first catch, finally back away from the hippo as it continues to charge at them . The hippo retreats to others of its kind as the lions finally leave the pack alone and instead simply look on from afar. Mr Stapelkamp said the lions will become more adept at hunting prey as they mature, adding: 'They will learn that they are probably better off eating warthogs' Mr Stapelkamp explained that as the pair of lions mature they will become more adept at hunting prey. He said: 'As brothers these two will no doubt stick together in their dispersal and form a coalition which has a better chance of securing territory. 'They will soon learn that rather than catching large prey like this hippo calf, they are probably better off eating warthogs and young giraffe first. 'The hippo was actually not scared at all, no doubt secure in the knowledge that mum was just meters away ready to help out.'
ISIS militants besieging a Palestinian refugee camp in Syria's capital have savagely beheaded the leaders of a Hamas-linked group opposed to President Bashar Assad, it has been claimed. Having seized control of up to 90 per cent of the Yarmouk camp in south Damascus, the jihadis posted gruesome images showing the severed heads of two alleged members of Aknaf Beit al-Maqdis online. Like ISIS, the Palestinian group has declared Israel its sworn enemy, although its presence in Yarmouk has until now been to defend the camp's 18,000 residents from a crippling two year siege carried out by the Assad regime. ISIS' decision to publicly execute the men - as well as reports of the deaths of dozens more Palestinians during clashes inside Yarmouk - has prompted outrage in Gaza, where hundreds of furious Hamas supporters swore bloody revenge on the terror group during a march yesterday. Scroll down for video . Savages: ISIS militants (pictured) stormed the Yarmouk camp in south Damascus last Wednesday. 100 civilians were either killed or kidnapped by the jihadis in the subsequent days . Killers: Islamic State militants are seen storming the Yarmouk camp in Damascus last week . Hundreds of residents of the Yarmouk camp fled yesterday amid shelling by government forces and clashes between ISIS fighters and Palestinian militants, activists said. An activist based in an area just south of Damascus, Hatem al-Dimashqi, said many residents started fleeing the camp after midnight as the fighting let up. The camp has been subjected to intense shelling and airstrikes by government warplanes allegedly carrying barrel bombs. This morning activists said shelling and sporadic clashes are striking the Palestinian refugee camp in the Syrian capital, a situation a U.N. official describes as 'beyond inhumane.' Hatem al-Dimashqi, an activist based in an area just south of Damascus, said the Yarmouk camp witnessed sporadic clashes and shelling earlier today. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and al-Dimashqi said the refugees who have fled the camp have reached the southern Damascus suburbs of Yalda, Babila and Beit Sahem, which are under the control of anti-Assad rebels. Al-Dimashqi and Syrian state TV said as many as 2,000 people have left the camp. The activist said that many of those who fled the camp are staying in schools or abandoned homes. Roaming the streets: ISIS stormed the camp last Wednesday, marking the terrorist's deepest foray yet into Damascus - the Syrian capital and base of President Assad's government . Power: Palestinian officials and Syrian activists said ISIS have been working with rivals from the Al Qaeda affiliate in Syria, Nusra Front and have taken control of up to 90 per cent of Yarmouk . Chris Gunness, a spokesman for the U.N. agency that supports Palestinian refugees known as UNRWA, last night said that the agency has not been able to send any food nor any convoys into the camp since the current round of fighting started. 'That means that there is no food, there is no water and there is very little medicine,' he added. ISIS stormed the camp on Wednesday, marking the terrorist's deepest foray yet into Damascus - the Syrian capital and base of President Assad's government. Palestinian officials and Syrian activists said ISIS have been working with rivals from the Al Qaeda affiliate in Syria, Nusra Front. The two groups have fought bloody battles against each other in other parts of Syria, but appear to be cooperating in the attack on Yarmouk. The Nusra Front said in a statement yesterday that it is not participating in the battles and is taking a neutral stance. The statement added that Nusra opened its offices and welcomed all those who don't want to take part in the fighting and gave them refuge. Conflict zone: Hatem al-Dimashqi, an activist based in an area just south of Damascus, said the Yarmouk camp (pictured) witnessed sporadic clashes and shelling earlier today . The UN says around 18,000 civilians, including a large number of children, are trapped in Yarmouk (pictured) Speaking of Hamas-linked groups' clashes with ISIS in the camp, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said that residents of Yarmouk have been victimized by Syria's civil war. Government forces and different rebel factions are clashing and 'we pay the price,' he said. He added that the Palestine Liberation Organization in Damascus has formed a 'cell to handle this tragedy and they are trying to work it out with the least losses.' Abbas said: 'We are in touch with our brothers there to find a way out and protect our people.' The Observatory said the fighting has killed 26 people since the clashes first broke out. In Gaza, several hundred supporters of the ruling Hamas group staged a march in the Jebaliya refugee camp late last night to protest ISIS' takeover of parts of Yarmouk. 'Palestinian blood is not cheap,' Mohammed Abu Askar, a local Hamas leader, told the crowd, threatening revenge for the Islamic State incursion into Yarmouk. In Damascus, Anwar Raja, the spokesman for Damsascus-based Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine - General Command, which supports embattled Syrian President Bashar Assad, said several pro-Assad factions have united to defend the camp. He said more than 100 civilians have been either killed or kidnapped by the ISIS fighters whom he said now control about half the camp, adding that the priority now is to evacuate civilians. Anger: Palestinians shout slogans as they hold banners during a gathering in solidarity with the Palestinians living and dying in Syria's Yarmouk camp over the weekend . Taking to the streets: In Gaza, several hundred supporters of the ruling Hamas group staged a march in the Jebaliya refugee camp late last night to protest ISIS' takeover of parts of Yarmouk . Placards: Speaking of Hamas-linked groups' clashes with ISIS in the camp, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said that residents of Yarmouk have been victimized by Syria's civil war . The UN says around 18,000 civilians, including a large number of children, are trapped in Yarmouk. The camp has been under government siege for nearly two years, leading to starvation and illnesses caused by lack of medical aid. The camp has also witnessed several rounds of ferocious and deadly fighting between government forces and militants. Most of the camp's estimated 160,000 inhabitants fled in late 2012 as clashes erupted between pro- and anti-Assad Palestinian gunmen. The majority of those who left fled to overcrowded and destitute Palestinian refugee camps in neighboring Lebanon. Only the poorest remained behind. Yesterday Lebanon's state-run National News Agency said six Lebanese truck drivers who were held by militants after they captured the Nasib border crossing point with Jordan have returned safely to Lebanon. The agency reported on Friday that 10 drivers were held by militants. The fate of the four others remains unknown.
He could have put it anywhere really. Stuck it away simply, without too much fuss. Yes, there was a goalkeeper still to beat but running straight on to the target, not a blue shirt in range, the odds were most certainly with Luis Suarez. Yet every great player has a showman inside and the Uruguayan is no exception. His finish — curled into the top corner, right-footed, inch perfect, yet explosive — was a moment of pure pleasure, a flourish that will not be forgotten. It was also Barcelona’s third — probably the goal that puts this tie beyond reach. Here was a goal-scorer at the top of his game, playing for a club that now brings the best out of him. If there ever was a battle of egos at Barcelona, it is over and football has won.

BY ADAM CRAFTON . Lionel Messi is playing with joy again, and bringing the best out of Neymar and Suarez, too. The Catalans have scored more goals than any Champions League team away from home this season — and all have come from their forward trio. Suarez has 11 goals in his last 11 games for Barcelona, and six in six in the Champions League. Liverpool fans will not enjoy hearing this, but he seems at home. So maybe it has something to do with the players after all. Suarez wasn’t schooled in tiki-taka or the Barcelona way, but the combination of an energetic high pressing game married to quite gorgeous technique and invention fits him like a glove. As Barcelona’s old boss, Pep Guardiola, struggled with his new group against Porto, Barcelona marched on, their philosophy enduring beyond coaches or academies. They buy great players, and these players often do great things. That is the Barcelona way too. Paris St-Germain got a late and lucky consolation goal that some will feel keeps this tie competitive, but for those of a more earthbound persuasion it is hard to see it as anything but over. Suarez killed it with his two goals leaving PSG to seek a 3-0 win at the Nou Camp inside 90 minutes to progress. And they haven’t got nil in them — not against this trio. David Luiz was Suarez’s victim here, and he took chunks out of his reputation, without so much as a baring of teeth. For once, though, sympathy was with the Brazilian. A hamstring injury was due to keep him out for a month — and that was just 10 days ago. Shorn of key individuals by injury and suspension, Laurent Blanc started with Luiz on the bench — and was forced to promote him to the action after 21 minutes when Thiago Silva limped out of the game. Barcelona were already ahead by then and instantly one feared for Luiz against opponents with such flair and movement. It took a while, but eventually those fears were realised. Luiz, to his credit, was up for it — he just wasn’t up to it, which is different entirely. Suarez would have known that, and known Luiz’s defensive frailties even when fit from his time in the Premier League, and the way the goals were scored suggested he had no compunction capitalising on it either. Suarez scores his first goal of the night to make it 2-0 to Barcelona after bustling past three PSG defenders . Suarez nutmegs Luiz wide on the right touchline on his way to scoring Barcelona's second goal of the evening . Suarez runs away to celebrate his goal as he joined by his ecstatic team-mate Neymar, who had earlier made it 1-0 to Barcelona . Suarez is mobbed by his jubilant Barcelona team-mates after his first goal as they enjoy their trip to France . Basically, to get nut-megged once is unfortunate; to have it happen twice suggests someone is trying to make you look a twit. This was street football — and not for the first time Luiz was cast as the plaything of a hapless gamer. What skill by Suarez, though. Collecting the ball on the right flank, he turned and put it through Luiz’s legs, leaving him helpless and unable to recover. Suarez then held off two PSG players as he darted through the tightest of gaps into the penalty area, finishing past an equally defeated keeper Salvatore Sirigu. His next was even better. Through the middle, charging directly at Luiz, embarrassing him with a nutmeg again, before finishing in style, an absolute gem of a goal. It is hard to imagine how, even with the fillip of Gregory van der Wiel’s deflected shot, PSG can claw this back. Blanc’s team have enormous spirit as Chelsea discovered and held their end up here, too, but Barcelona simply have too much class. They took their chances and PSG did not — a fatal flaw with the odds already stacked against them.

Edinson Cavani was the prime culprit and he had a night of clumsy control and missed opportunity when it mattered most. Javier Pastore, too. Eric Cantona says that he is the best player in the world, better than Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo — but not all of Eric’s statements are shot through with wisdom. Pastore set the tone for PSG in front of goal, by making a hash of their first chance of the night. When they did finally score it was only because a tame shot by Van der Wiel took a spiteful deflection off substitute Jeremy Mathieu. Barcelona started well and could have gone ahead when Messi hit a post with a curling 20-yard shot after 14 minutes. It served as a warning and four minutes later Barcelona went ahead. The move began, as so many do, with Sergio Busquets breaking up play. From there, Barcelona countered with terrifying speed, Messi feeding Neymar, who finished astutely with only Sirigu to beat. He could have had another after 26 minutes when a fine jinking run forced a good save. Javier Pastore fluffs his lines as he misses a brilliant chance to put PSG 1-0 up against the run of play . Gregory van der Wiel's (left) late deflected effort gave PSG a glimmer of hope ahead of the second leg next week . Shortly before half-time the Italian was needed again, when Luiz took on too much sweeping up at the back and was caught in possession by Suarez. He curled a shot which Sirigu plucked out of the air, the last time he would get the better of their exchanges. Not everything Barcelona does is beautiful, however. Jordi Alba’s dive under pressure from Thiago Silva after five minutes was deeply unimpressive and deserved a booking. Mark Clattenburg, the referee, ducked out of that one, although he did later book Messi. One to tell the grandkids, no doubt, although they might be more interested in a retelling of Suarez’s goals.

Chelsea's Eden Hazard and Arsenal's Santi Cazorla are set to reach a Premier League milestone this weekend when they each make their 100th appearance. Both players have been hugely influential since they moved to London in the summer of 2012, but who has been the most exciting import to watch? Here, Sportsmail's reporters choose the player they most enjoy seeing in action. Eden Hazard (L) and Santi Cazorla are both set to make their 100th Premier League appearance this weekend . Lee Clayton . Cazorla has wonderful balance. So does Hazard. Cazorla scores important goals. So does Hazard. Cazorla is two-footed. So is Hazard. Cazorla dances past opponents. So does Hazard. So, while there is not a lot to choose between them and Hazard is likely to get the most picks in this article, I am going for Cazorla. It's a personal choice. He is a wonderful footballer. I have paid to watch them both (and I will pay to watch them both again), but the little Spanish magician edges it for me. VERDICT: CAZORLA . Cazorla, pictured in action against Burnley, has been an influential part of Arsenal's midfield this season . Ian Ladyman . I remember when Manchester City baulked at paying Hazard's wages when the Belgian was up for grabs in 2012. Back then City thought the young forward had a rather high opinion of his own worth for a player who was yet to play in a major European league. In the early days of his time at Chelsea, it looked as though City may have been right. He showed flashes of brilliance but also looked rather too easy to push off the ball. Roll forward to 2015, however, and the 24-year-old has developed in to one of the most important players in the Barclays Premier League. Brave, strong and ambitious, Hazard plays on the front foot and with only one thought in this mind. Rather like Cristiano Ronaldo, he has also developed in to the type of player ever defender hates, simply because he gets back up every time he is knocked to the ground. He would get in every team in the Premier League and is one of the reasons Chelsea will win the title this season. VERDICT: HAZARD . Hazard controls the ball under pressure from Stoke midfielder Stephen Ireland at Stamford Bridge . Dominic King . It has to be Hazard. I saw him play for Lille twice in the season before he joined Chelsea – once against St Etienne, the other was what proved to be his final appearance against Nancy. He scored two in the first match, a hat-trick the latter and played a different game to those around him. He hasn't disappointed since arriving here and I love the nonchalance with which he takes a penalty, his low centre of gravity and the way he can bamboozle defenders. If there is such a thing as £32million bargain, it is Hazard. VERDICT: HAZARD . Hazard celebrates after scoring a fine individual goal in Chelsea's 3-2 win against Hull in March . Nick Harris . Now this is a tricky one because while Eden Hazard will frequently embark on a dribble or dink in a pass that will make you nod in appreciation, he'll also miss a penalty and make you groan. Whereas the older Cazorla, less flashy but no less of a technical master, is to my mind more of a fulcrum, more important relatively to the sum of Arsenal's parts than Hazard is to Chelsea. You'll gasp at Hazard but Cazorla's wow factor is richer. That's not to dismiss either: both are brilliant footballers, contributing goals, assists and flair. Any neutral would bite your hand off to have either playing in your team. Forced to pick though, it's Cazorla, for his consistency and crucially doing it in the biggest games. Exhibit A would be Manchester City 0 Arsenal 2 in January; goal, assist, all-round brilliance, against a big team, at an important time. VERDICT: CAZORLA . Cazorla scores from the penalty spot in Arsena's 2-0 away win at Manchester City in January . Riath Al-Samarrai . Eden Hazard for me. Cazorla is an utter delight, a little pinball of a man who is probably the most two-footed player I've seen. Put him in a tight space and then you see what makes him rare among the best. But Hazard is the top player in the Premier League, in my opinion. This is the sixth of his eight seasons as a professional where he has reached double figures and yet he offers so much more than goals (36 in 99 in the Premier League for Chelsea). He can beat a man and, better still, you sense he likes doing it. Technically, his passing and shooting are excellent and he also has a mind capable of sussing out the shapes and systems in front of him. That intelligence, more specifically his speed of thought, is probably what makes separates the good from the brilliant. A complete player who doesn't yet seem to have the complete ego. VERDICT: HAZARD . Hazard gets away from Manchester City duo Fernando (left) and Martin Demichelis at Stamford Bridge . Laurie Whitwell . Has to be Hazard for me. The way he carries the ball through ever tightening spaces and emerges the other side is a joy. Like one of those Indiana Jones impossible escapes from a sliding door or rolling boulder. And his penalties are mesmeric. I could watch them again and again not working out how he does it. VERDICT: HAZARD . Belgium international Hazard scores a header past West Ham goalkeeper Adrian at Upton Park . Sami Mokbel . Both are marvellous players, but I could watch Santi Cazorla all day. When he first arrived in England I remember, whilst sitting in the Upton Park press box, trying to work out whether he was left or right footed. He was wonderful that day as Arsenal cruised to a 3-1 win; it was one of the most complete performances I've seen live. In truth, I've still got no idea whether he's left or right footed. He's that natural on either. Hazard is a phenomenon, but aesthetically no on can touch Cazorla in the Premier League. VERDICT: CAZORLA . Cazorla grins after scoring Arsenal's fourth goal against Aston Villa at the Emirates in February . Jack Gaughan . From a purely artistic sense, Santi Cazorla is probably the most graceful individual on the ball in the entire Premier League. But Eden Hazard provides moments to really stick in the memory. He glides past opponents effortlessly and regularly chips in with important goals - plenty of them stunning in their execution. Worth the ticket alone. The one blot from Cazorla's point of view is that his genius can be fleeting. VERDICT: HAZARD . Sam Cunningham . Jose Mourinho has told him to add more goals to his game to move on a par with Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo and, three years younger than the Argentine and six than the Portuguese, he is not far from doing that. I've watched Hazard countless times at Stamford Bridge this season and he makes the game seem like an art form with his movement, dribbling and passing. Cazorla can excite at times, but he is nowhere near consistently reaching Hazard's level. For me there is no contest between the pair. VERDICT: HAZARD . Hazard tucks home yet another penalty during Chelsea 2-1 win against Stoke City last weekend . Craig Hope . I would far rather have Hazard in my team, but I can't help but feel the excitement has been stripped from him under Jose Mourinho. Efficient, technically brilliant, effective and hard-working he most certainly is - and he will be crowned PFA Player of the Year - but he is no longer the daring dribbler of whom we heard so much about during his teenage years in France. He is, though, arguably a better player for Mourinho's influence. Cazorla, meanwhile, would never thrive under Mourinho, there is too much of Juan Mata about him. But there is no doubt he is thrilling to watch on his day - it's just a shame those days aren't as frequent as they should be for a player of his calibre. VERDICT: HAZARD .

Creating romantic, sepia-toned images is a cinch now that we have Instagram filters to play with. But back in the early 21st century, taking a picture was an entirely different process, requiring patience, precision and a very talented eye. Dreamlike snaps of a young woman in red posing at Lulworth Cove, Dorset, in 1913 have now been revealed as some of the earliest surviving colour photographs. Scroll down for video . A collection of pictures of Christina O'Gorman posing for her father, electrical engineer and photographer Mervyn O'Gorman, back in 1913 have been revealed as some of the earliest colour photographs ever taken . The ethereal images were taken on the beach at Lulworth Cove, Dorset, when Malcolm was 42 . The images are part of the Royal Photographic Society, held at the National Media Museum, and are currently on display at the National Media Museum, Bradford. They are among a collection of the world's oldest surviving photographs. The woman in question was teenager Christina O'Gorman, posing for her father, electrical engineer and photographer Mervyn O'Gorman back in 1913. Mervyn was 42 at the time when he took the images of his daughter, who languidly sits, in an array of vibrant red outfits, including a swimsuit, a cloak and a shirt. The teen, characterised by her long strawberry-blonde hair, poses in different scenarios on the beach at Lulworth Cove in the English county of Dorset and appears unaware of her father. The delicately-coloured images are on display at the National Media Museum in Bradford . Christina is seen sitting on the Dorset beach with friends in the 102-year-old images . The strawberry-blonde teenager wore red, probably at the request of her father as the vibrant colour captured particularly well via the autochrome process . Mervyn was known as an early pioneer of colour photography and used the autochrome process to capture the haunting images. Patented in 1903, the process involved using glass plates covered in potato starches grains to filter pictures with dye. Mervyn was known as an early pioneer of colour photography and often used the autochrome process, which involved using glass plates covered in potato starches grains to filter pictures with dye . Christina's life remains a mystery as there are no recorded detail of the then-teen's life . The National Media Museum explained: 'The comparatively long exposure time has given the sea a glassy quality and the large aperture setting and narrow depth of field has put Durdle Door in the background into soft focus.' The repetition of the red attire was due to the fact that the vibrant colour captured particularly well in an autochrome process. Mervyn died in 1958, with his wife Florence passing 27 years beforehand in 1931. As to Christina's life, there are no recorded details.
Alvaro Morata wants to continue his development at Juventus and has no interest in rejoining Real Madrid, according to his agent Beppe Bozzo. The 22-year-old joined the Italian giants for £15.8million last summer after failing to break into the Real first-team on a regular basis. Morata signed a five-year deal at the Juventus Stadium after starting just three games in La Liga for Real during the 20113-14 campaign. Alvaro Morata is happy at Juventus and has no interest in joining Real Madrid, according to his agent . And the Spain international has impressed since moving to Turin - having netted seven goals in 22 Serie A matches so far this season. Madrid have a buy back option on the forward but Bozzo insists Morata is keen to fulfill his five-year deal at the Juventus Stadium and develop as a player. 'The situation just now is very favourable for Juve. When it comes to important players like him, we almost always have the last word, regardless of clubs or clauses,' Bozzo told Tuttosport. 'Morata is fine at Juve, he is not thinking about anything else. It all depends on what the player wants, just as it was when he decided to leave Madrid a year ago. Morata (left) started just three La Liga games for Real last season - in a season of limited opportunities . 'Alvaro is not a hypocrite, he says what he thinks. He will not have a foot in both camps. A few days ago he said that Juve is fine and that he isn't thinking of returning to Madrid; he wants continue to grow with Juve. Even to me he has always expressed the same idea. 'No club, not even one as powerful as Real, can spend so much money to sign a player who does not want to move. 'He is already worth twice as much as Juve spent to buy him - at least €40 (£29) million.' 22-year-old (left) has scored seven goals in 22 Serie A matches so far this campaign for Juventus .
Double rapist Solomon Khoorban, 33, a former soldier based at Woolwich barracks, London, has been jailed for 16 years . A double rapist ex-soldier who went undetected for 12 years after attacking a 16-year-old in a West End nightclub and raping a second woman at knifepoint has finally been jailed. Violent Solomon Khoorban, now 33, forced himself on the teenager in the VIP area at Equinox nightclub in Leicester Square - which has now been replaced by a casino - after punching her so hard in the face  that she was knocked unconscious. He then ordered his terrified victim to wait in the VIP area for at least 30 minutes, threatening to kill her if she did not oblige. Princess Diana was among a host of famous faces who attended shows, events and after parties at the club before it closed down. Just two months later, in August 2003, the knife-wielding attacker raped a 32-year-old woman as she walked through Greenwich, south east London. The former gunner, who was 21 at the time, put her in a headlock, dragged her  into the bushes and raped her twice. He also told her: 'B****** shouldn't be out at this time'. Both rapes were reported to police at the time but it took detectives more than a decade to track Khoorban down and link him to the sex attacks. The arrest came after the Met’s Specialist Crime and Operations Command carried out a review of both investigations in September 2014. Detectives combed through a series of ID photos from the British Army before identifying Khoorban as a suspect. When he was arrested in November 2014, police linked his DNA to the attacks. He had not previously been on the DNA database because he had not been in trouble with police. Jailing him at Snaresbrooke Crown Court for 16 years, Judge Sheelagh Canavan said Khoorban was a 'violent sexual predator' who had ruined his victims' lives. She said: 'The damage you have caused these women and no doubt will continue to cause will last the rest of their lives. They are serving a life sentence. 'The younger girl was 16 with her whole life to look forward to and she is moving forward with this over her. 'The second victim has been traumatised by what you did to her. Nothing I can say or do will change that. 'You are a violent sexual predator, I have no doubt you were excited by your use of violence which was far beyond anything that was needed to achieve your purpose.' During the hearing, the court heard how Khoorban had raped his first victim during a night out when she was marking the end of her GCSEs. The soldier had asked his victim to go upstairs to talk and she agreed because her feet were hurting after dancing in high heels. The court heard how the subsequent attack was so violent that the teenager had to be rushed to hospital to be treated for her injuries. Judge Sheelagh Canavan said: 'I doubt anyone who was there will forget the sight of that young girl as she ran from the scene of the attack.' The court heard how police had launched a manhunt for Khoorban after the first rape, releasing an e-fit in a public appeal. Wanted: At the time of the attack, police released this grainy CCTV footage showing Khoorban (right) leaving the club . The first rape took place in Equinox nightclub - which has now been replaced by a casino - in London's Leicester Square (file picture - club not pictured) But Khoorban, who was based with the Royal Artillery's 16th Regiment at Woolwich barracks at the time, was not caught. Instead, two months later, he targeted another woman after prowling the Greenwich area armed with a knife. In a desperate attempt to protect herself, the victim told Khoorban she was pregnant and had AIDS. But Khoorban shoved his hand over her mouth, thrust the knife into her face and punched her repeatedly, knocking out her teeth and leaving her with permanent scarring. After raping her, Khoorban told the woman to wait in the bushes for ten minutes to allow him time to escape. He threatened to 'finish her' off if she moved. The court heard how the victim told police it was 'like an eagle had landed on me'. The court heard how, during his time in the army, Khoorban once bit off part of a comrade's earlobe and broke his nose. He hit another soldier in the face and punched a third so many times he lost consciousness. But the soldier, who served in Northern Ireland, Cyprus and Germany, never faced a civil or military charges for these offences. He was only discharged from the army in 2007 for using cocaine. Several years after the attacks, he was also  diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and depression. In court, the defendant acknowledged he was not suffering mental health problems at the time of the attacks in 2003. Christopher Amis, defending, said his client wanted forgiveness from his victims, but was not expecting it. He told the court: 'There's nothing I can say to undo what this defendant visited on these two victims, nothing can put matters right and absolutely nothing that can turn back the clock.' He added: 'He entered pleas of guilty, he has not prevaricated and whatever else he's done he has at least spared these two victims of these appalling crimes the ordeal of having to give evidence in front of a jury. 'He served in the army for a number of years and while it's true he was discharged in circumstances relating to the taking of cocaine, it's also right that there's no evidence that whilst he was serving in the army he did anything other than discharge his duty satisfactorily.' Mr Amis said Khoorban also recognised that he had been 'a bad person' for carrying out the attacks. Khooban was based at Woolwich barracks (pictured) in south east London at the time of the attacks in 2003 . 'I asked him why he did it and he said "I was a bad person in those days, I recognise it and I say it, I don't recognise myself now as the person I was then"', he told the court. 'I asked him if there was anything he wished me to say that he felt he would want said, he said: "I just want forgiveness, I'm not expecting it, I don't deserve it but I want it and I need it". 'He acknowledges that he will never be forgiven for these appalling offences and that's a burden he will carry the burden for the rest of his days.' Mr Amis added that Khoorban was on the point of refusing to come into court to face his two victims. Khoorban, who appeared in the dock in a dark green prison tracksuit and a full beard, sat with his head in his hands and sighed throughout the hearing. The former soldier, from East Ham, London, will also have to sign  the sex offender's register indefinitely. After the hearing, investigating officer Detective Sergeant Matt Flynn praised the bravery of the two victims. He said: 'Both young women were subjected to horrific and gratuitous ordeals at the hands of a dangerous and predatory individual. 'The devastating affect of these attacks on both women is indescribable. For the past 12 years they have had to get on with their lives knowing their attacker was still out there. 'It is only due to their courage and fortitude that Khoorban was charged with these abhorrent and cowardly attacks. Without their support he would not have been brought to justice.'
Sally Cox, 39, stopped her son Jed Pearce, 10 (pictured together above), from going on the mosque trip, expressing fears of 'violence and guns' Children as young as eight have been banned by their parents from attending a British mosque as part of a school trip over 'safety' fears, with one mother claiming she 'doesn't want to put her son at risk of being shot'. Nearly 100 primary pupils from Lostwithiel School in Cornwall were due to travel 68 miles to visit the mosque in Exeter, Devon, as part of an RE trip to learn about different faiths. The schoolchildren, from years three to six, were due to visit the city's cathedral before taking a tour of the mosque and observing a congregational prayer. However, about 10 pupils have now pulled out of next week's school trip after their parents said they  would be exposed to 'violence and guns' and expressed 'grave concerns' about the teaching of Islam. Christine Trevethen, 47, a housewife from Lostwithiel, Cornwall, has stopped her 10-year-old daughter Keira going on the visit. She said: 'We are not the only ones that don't want our kids to go - but a lot of the others haven't been honest enough to do so in the consent form. 'I do not want my daughter going to the mosque for personal reasons. I don't agree with the religion and what it stands for - but I am not prepared to go into the reasons why. 'We have now been told our children are going to be excluded from RE lessons as a result, which is a big concern. 'We tried to go through the right channels but the school handled it very badly.' Sally Cox, 39, a self-employed cleaner from Lerryn, Cornwall, has also blocked her son Jed Pearce, 10, from going on the visit. She said: 'I did not want him to go because they are a violent religion and many of them have guns. 'You can see what they are like every day on the news. There was a Muslim bomber in Exeter just a few years ago. 'We were just being honest saying we did not want them to go. 'It is unsafe. I don't want my son being shot. Also this is not a religious school yet they are willing to take a whole day out for religion. 'I don't want them to do that. I want him to be in school learning Maths and English - not being put at risk of being shot. 'They decided to take him out of RE, but I said I am fine with that.' Nearly 100 primary pupils from Lostwithiel School in Cornwall were due to travel 68 miles to visit the mosque in Exeter, Devon (pictured) as part of an RE trip  but 10 pulled out after parents expressed 'grave concerns' Another parent, who did not want to be named, said: 'We have grave concerns about the children's safety during the trip due to the horrific events that occur every day. 'We have therefore decided not to send our children on this trip. This decision is not one based on ignorance or racial or religious beliefs, but one based purely on safety concerns.' The parent said she was furious after the pupils who pulled out of the trip were singled out in a school assembly. She said: 'They were made to stand up after assembly. The sitting non-attendees were then asked individually why they were not going on the trip. 'This is not a decision the children have made, so discriminating against these children in this fashion is disgraceful, unacceptable and unprofessional.' However, not all parents are opposed to the trip, with some backing the school and suggesting the visit is a positive move. Alice Mitchell, 35, a playworker from Lostwithiel, said: 'I think we need to educate our children to be tolerant and dispel the rumours the media can congregate. 'I am all for my children going on the trip. I think celebrating diversity is a great thing. 'It is all down to fear. People are scared of other religions. There is a lot of misconceptions.' And Sian Cornish, 41, a self-employed retailer, from Lostwithiel, added:' 'I did not even realise it was an issue. I was delighted my child had the opportunity to experience another culture in their ways of worship. 'I think it is important to celebrate other cultures - even if you don't agree with them.' Carolyn Huxley, headteacher of Lostwithiel School (pictured), which has just 156 pupils on its books, said the trip would still take place on May 7 to 'show children the views of extremists are not a true reflection of Islam' Kat Smith, the chairman of governors for the school, said a group of parents had expressed concerns about the trip due to recent terror attacks by groups such as ISIS. She said: 'This is the first time pupils from the school have visited a mosque and it's an exciting opportunity for them to learn about different faiths and ensure that they're aware of the diverse nature of modern Britain. 'Because of recent news reports about extremist groups, such as ISIS, that identify themselves with Islam, a small number of parents have expressed concerns about the trip and the teaching of Islam in school. 'In response, the school held a special assembly with children to discuss these issues, and the head teacher has met and sent letters to parents with specific concerns. 'A full risk assessment has been conducted for the trip and there is no more risk attached to this trip than any other school trip.' Ms Smith said the school had a duty under the Equality Act 2010 to promote good relations between people of different beliefs and ethnicities. She said: 'Religious Education forms part of the basic curriculum in schools and its teaching is enshrined in law. Kat Smith, the chairman of governors for the Lostwithiel School, said parents expressed concerns about the teaching of Islam at the school . 'The school recognises that parents have the right to withdraw their child from RE in whole or in part, and provide alternative work to further their child's knowledge and understanding of the parents' beliefs and values. 'However, the school is aware that children growing up in Cornwall may have little contact with Muslims and it is aware that it has a duty under the Equality Act 2010 to promote good relations between people of different beliefs and ethnicities as part of its single equality duty. 'The Governing Body fully supports this trip and the teaching of RE, including Islam. 'It is the governors' hope that the visit to the mosque will provide an insight for pupils into the nature of British Islam, help them understand how Islam is presented in the media and that groups like ISIS are not a true reflection of the Islam followed by the vast majority of Muslims in Britain.' Carolyn Huxley, headteacher of the primary school which has just 156 pupils on its books and teaches those aged four to 11, said the trip would still be taking place on May 7. She said: 'Our hope from the visit to the mosque is that children will be given a view as to what are the values and beliefs of a British Muslim. 'This trip will show the children the views of extremists are not a true reflection of Islam as a religion.' Exeter Mosque, described as the 'Islamic Centre of the South West', is open daily for prayers and also welcomes those wishing to learn about the Quran and basics of the Deen. The Mosque also welcomes groups as part of education programmes and regularly hosts school trips. Lostwithiel School, which has around six teachers, said the trip was planned to enable children to learn further about different religions. The school said it follows the Cornwall Agreed Syllabus for Religious Education and part of the curriculum encourages children to study Christianity in great detail, as well as finding out about Hinduism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam through school trips, visits from outside speakers and class teaching. The Muslim Council of Great Britain said it was concerned by the views of some of the parents who strongly opposed the trip. A spokesman said: 'We would have thought a well-rounded education involves learning about those of a different faith. 'These laudable initiatives take place across the country. It is therefore disappointing to hear that some parents have chosen to pull their children out of a visit to a mosque due to events elsewhere in the world. 'We hope this incident is atypical and not reflective of a growing sentiment against Muslims in this country. 'We commend the headteacher for rightly stating that such a visit will help her pupils to understand real Islam and dispel the myths and hysteria that surrounds our religion.' MailOnline has contacted Exeter Mosque for comment.
As one might imagine, Rafa Benitez's arrival at Stamford Bridge as interim manager in 2012 came as quite a slap in the face to Chelsea fans still hurting from Roberti Di Matteo's untimely departure just months after winning the Champions League. This was a man who had beaten the Blues in two Champions League semi-finals with drab defensive tactics - meaning that a sub-standard Liverpool side reached two finals, while Jose Mourinho's team of world class individuals missed out. As expected, we didn't warm to Rafa when he walked out for his first game at the Bridge. He had made a number of derogatory comments about the club during his Liverpool days and was rightly given a frosty reception. Rafa Benitez is set to leave Napoli this summer and will have a host of clubs after his services . Benitez was made Chelsea interim manager in 2012 but it's fair to say the fans never warmed to him . Cody Taylor is a fan writer on 90min.com . He did little to bring the support on-side in his the first few weeks either. Chelsea drew Benitez's first two games 0-0, before a 3-1 defeat against West Ham in a London derby - embarrassing. The only thing is, in the end he managed to get the job done and it would be the same for another club today. Rafa never liked being called the 'interim' manager, in fact he made a point of letting people know the title irked him, but he was brought in on a mission to keep the club on course until the end of the season. It wasn't pretty, but that was exactly what he did. Rafa also managed to get a better return from Fernando Torres - a player that was pretty much useless at Chelsea before and after. The season even ended with another European trophy. People often forget that in 2011/12 Chelsea finished 6th in the Premier League - the lowest in 10 years - a fact conveniently masked by two cup wins. In 2012/13 Rafa ensured Chelsea finished 3rd and got an automatic pass back into the Champions League group stage when there was big pressure from Arsenal and Tottenham. As Chelsea fans, we certainly didn't like him, but looking back we hate to think what might have happened without him. Benitez got the best out of his squad for the rest of the season and he got the best out of Fernando Torres . Chelsea won the Europa League in 2013 under Rafa Benitez after beating Benfica in Amsterdam . One Chelsea fan thanks Benitez for his efforts on the last day of the season in 2013 at Stamford Bridge . The rumours are that he could now be on for a return to the Premier League - he knows English football inside out and would actually be perfect for several clubs. Manchester City is one possible destination - he'd probably do a similar interim job there while they wait for Pep Guardiola - and Newcastle is another. The reality is that while Rafa possibly wouldn't be a popular choice at either, he would give both clubs exactly what they need. City require an experienced and pragmatic stop-gap that knows how to keep things ticking over until they can land their superstar. Newcastle need someone who can get the best out of a talented group of players that are significantly underachieving at this moment in time. In that respect Rafa certainly made sure Liverpool punched above their weight. People don't like to admit it, but he's a good manager and probably deserves his chance in the Premier League again.
A mysterious 'ring of fire' has been spotted in space thanks to Albert Einstein's theory of relatively. The ring, located 12 billion light years away, is an illusion created by the chance alignment of two distant galaxies. The striking circular structure is a rare manifestation of gravitational lensing predicted by Albert Einstein in his theory of general relativity. Scroll down for video . Alma's image of the gravitationally lensed galaxy SDP.81. The bright orange central region of the ring - Alma's highest resolution observation ever - reveals the glowing dust in this distant galaxy . Gravitational lensing occurs when a massive galaxy or cluster of galaxies bends the light emitted from a more distant galaxy, forming a highly magnified, though much distorted image. In this particular case, the galaxy known as SDP.81 and an intervening galaxy line up so perfectly that the light from the more distant one forms a nearly complete circle as seen from Earth. Einstein's theory predicts that the gravitational effects of the nearer galaxy will bend the light of the more distant one. The Alma telescope in Chile was able to capture the effect in the highest resolution images ever taken by the observatory. In this particular case, the galaxy known as SDP.81 and an intervening galaxy line up so perfectly that the light from the more distant one forms a nearly complete circle as seen from Earth. Discovered by the Herschel Space Observatory, SDP.81 is an active star-forming galaxy nearly 12 billion light-years away, seen at a time when the universe was only 15 percent of its current age. It is being lensed by a massive foreground galaxy that is a comparatively nearby 4 billion light-years away. 'Gravitational lensing is used in astronomy to study the very distant, very early Universe because it gives even our best telescopes an impressive boost in power,' said Alma Deputy Program Scientist Catherine Vlahakis. 'With the astounding level of detail in these new Alma images, astronomers will now be able to reassemble the information contained in the distorted image we see as a ring and produce a reconstruction of the true image of the distant galaxy.' An AlmaHubble composite image of the gravitationally lensed galaxy SDP.81. The diffuse blue element at the center of the ring is from the intervening lensing galaxy, as seen with the Hubble Space Telescope . The highest resolution image of SDP.81 was made by observing the relatively bright light emitted by cosmic dust in the distant galaxy. This striking image reveals well-defined arcs in a pattern that hints at a more complete, nearly contiguous ring structure. Though this intriguing interplay of gravity and light in SDP.81 has been studied previously by other observatories, none has captured the remarkable details of the ring structure in such detail. 'The exquisite amount of information contained in the Alma images is incredibly important for our understanding of galaxies in the early universe,' said astronomer Jacqueline Hodge with the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Charlottesville, Va. 'Astronomers use sophisticated computer programs to reconstruct lensed galaxies' true appearance. 'This unravelling of the bending of light done by the gravitational lens will allow us to study the actual shape and internal motion of this distant galaxy much more clearly than has been possible until now.' The striking circular-like structure is a rare and manifestation of gravitational lensing predicted by Albert Einstein (right) in his theory of general relativity. Gravitational lensing occurs when a massive galaxy or cluster of galaxies bends the light emitted from a more distant galaxy .
Homesick Sam Tomkins insists it is not a foregone conclusion that he will return to Wigan when he cuts short his New Zealand Warriors stay at the end of the season. The 26-year-old England full-back is interesting his former club, where his brother Joel plays, and Wigan have an option to bring him back to the DW Stadium. When announcing his departure barely 18 months ago, Wigan announced they could re-sign Tomkins on a 'defined salary' on his return to Super League. Sam Tomkins has been released by the New Zealand Warriors after feeling homesick . And while Tomkins says it would 'be nice' to resume his Wigan career, he is tentatively exploring alternative options too. Asked where he would be playing next, Tomkins said: 'I've not worked that out just yet. The first thing was to sort it out over here that I could go back. 'Hopefully that'll be sorted in the not-too-distant future.' Wigan is where Tomkins launched his career, playing for the club from 2008 to 2013, so it is inevitable he should be linked with last season's Grand Final runners-up. 'That's where my brother's playing and that's where I'm from, but I'm open to other places. I'm just trying to work out what will be the best option for me,' he said. 'Wigan would be nice but I know it's not the only team I can go to.' Before the announcement on Wednesday morning that Tomkins will be on the move, Wigan chairman Ian Lenagan told Wigan Today: 'If he became available we would be very interested. 'We've got the first option. If it gets to the point where he is available it is in our hands. And I'll be delighted if that was the case.' Tomkins has been open with his current club about the reasons for wanting to leave. Rather than not settling into the New Zealand game, it is being apart from his family and friends that has been niggling away at Tomkins, unsettling him and leaving him longing for life back in the north of England. He told Sky Sports News: 'I've enjoyed every minute of being amongst that group but New Zealand is pretty far from Wigan, where all my family live, so I want to be back in England around my family. Tomkins celebrates winning the Super League Grand Final with Wigan in 2013 having spent five years with club . 'I'll be two years I've been away and to be able to go back and be around family and friends is what I'd rather be doing next year.' A replacement for Tomkins has already been found by New Zealand Warriors, with Kiwi international Roger Tuivasa-Sheck agreeing a three-year contract that will take effect from next season. Tuivasa-Sheck will join from Sydney Roosters, with New Zealand Warriors head coach Andrew McFadden describing the 21-year-old on Wednesday as 'a wonderful talent and a fantastic signing'. That has cleared the way for Tomkins, currently sidelined with a minor knee injury, to depart without causing excessive disruption 12 months before the end of his three-year contract. Tomkins joined the Warriors for a world record transfer fee - thought to be in the region of £700,000. 'They invested a lot into me to get me over here which I appreciate,' he said. 'They handled that brilliantly when I was coming and again equally so when I've asked if I can leave. 'It was tough because I feel like I owe them something and hope I can pay them back with another big year this year.' New Zealand Warriors managing director Jim Doyle said of Tomkins: 'He came here excited about testing himself in the NRL and also experiencing living in a new country but, in the end, Sam has found it too much of a challenge being away from home. 'It's disappointing that it has come to this but reluctantly we have accepted there is no option but to allow Sam to return to England.'

An Indiana university was in lockdown late on Friday night after a 'likely prank call' about an armed person near the main administration building, school officials said. Police said they received a phone call from someone saying that they had stabbed their roommate at the university, was armed with a shotgun and threatening to blow up the administration building, according to WTHR. Manchester University had issued a statement advising students at its North Manchester campus, some 36 miles  west of Fort Wayne, to shelter in place. Indiana State Police and a bomb squad responded to the incident, though left after deciding that it should be investigated as a likely prank call. Scroll down for video . Manchester University in Indiana (pictured) was on lockdown late Friday night after a 'likely prank call' about an armed with explosives on campus . 'Barricade yourself in a room, stay away from windows. Be quiet, silence cell. Wait for police or All-Clear,' the school said in a campus alert. 'Armed subject reported near admin building,' the school said on its Twitter account. It has continued reposting the shelter in place warning for hours after the original message and had not given the all clear as of 2am . The person was possibly armed with explosives, according to the university. North Manchester Police, a bomb squad from Fort Wayne and Indiana State Police were all at the scene, according to WANE. 'No injuries have been confirmed,' Manchester University posted on its Facebook page just after 1am. The liberal arts institution, which includes a master's and doctoral program, has about 1,500 students. Its website says that it is the home of the country's first peace studies program.

Drilling threes on the buzzer is all good as far as Cleveland Cavaliers superstar LeBron James is concerned - the buzzing of drills at the dentist is a whole other story. The 11-time All Star brushed off rough treatment from the Chicago Bulls as his Cavs won on Sunday by saying it's the sort of thing NBA stars should expect come this stage of the season. 'It's April,' James shrugged. But the self-titled King James' talk wasn't so tough as he paid a second visit to the dentist's chair in a fortnight, as shared with his 9.3 million followers on Instagram. 'Back at the dentist and I'm hearing a bunch of drilling going on behind me from my docs so I had to sit up like, "What the heck is going on back there." Hahaha but seriously what's up. #DentistNightMares,' he wrote in his latest chronicle from the dentist's chair. LeBron James posts an image of himself not especially pleased with the buzzing of drills at the dentist . The 11-time All Star led his Cleveland Cavaliers to victory over the Chicago Bulls on Sunday . LeBron delivered his first triple-double for Cavs as they won a 50th game of the campaign and 18th straight at home in their march towards the playoffs. He contributed 20 points, 10 rebounds and 12 assists, and one more if he claims credit for telling Kyrie Irving to shoot a 52-foot three on the buzzer at the end of the third quarter. James came crashing back to earth in the room filled with drills and sharp implements on Monday though after his on-fire Cavs accounted for the Bulls with some impressive shooting from outside at key moments proving the difference. On Sunday night LeBron's rival Joakim Noah was less than hospitable with a heavy foul or two. But the 30-year-old was more bothered by the man in the white coat and his assistant. LeBron delivered his first triple-double for Cavs as they beat the Bulls for their 50th win of the season . James also takes some credit for telling Kyle Irving to shoot a three from 52-feet on the third quarter buzzer . James (right) got the better of his rival Joakim Noah (13) during a physical encounter on Sunday . His dentist confession  comes two weeks after his last tooth-related post in which the four-time NBA MVP took a selfie as a series of instruments were put to work inside his mouth. 'So is this why folks say they hate Monday's!!???' he wrote at the time.

Queens Park Rangers manager Chris Ramsey claims that covert racism still exists in football boardrooms and that the implementing of a Rooney Rule could help raise awareness of the issue. Ramsey, the only black manager in the Premier League, has been vocal on racism in football in the past and supports John Barnes’s assertion that black managers find it difficult to get another job after being sacked. ‘Just because I’m sitting here I’m not going to change my views of many years,’ said Ramsey, who takes his side to West Brom in search of a much-needed three points on Saturday. Queens Park Rangers manager Chris Ramsey claims that covert racism still exists in football boardrooms . Ramsey believes that the implementing of a Rooney Rule could help raise awareness of the 'covert' issue . John Barnes’ view that black managers find it hard to get a job after being sacked was backed up by Ramsey . ‘The fact we’re still, at this stage of the game, highlighting that I’m the only black Premier League manager shows that it’s not the norm to have people from ethnic minorities in this position. ‘So until this becomes normal, and it’s not highlighted in such a spectacular fashion, racism will be prominent. ‘Obviously, I’m in a very fortunate position to be the manager of QPR but I hope people won’t look at that as a token gesture. I think I’ve earned my stripes to be in this position. Barnes' last managerial job was at Tranmere in 2009. He lasted four months before being sacked . Ramsey is operating as the only black manager in the Premier League as he looks to keep QPR up . Ramsey was without a job for seven months after leaving his coaching role at Tottenham last season . ‘I think that there are other people who are probably more talented or better suited, from a profile point of view, as many white managers who have got jobs based on their profile and playing experience.’ The 52-year-old manager thinks that discrimination isn’t exclusive to race and that the Rooney Rule — which obliges America’s NFL teams to interview minority candidates for top jobs — might be the solution here. ‘If it doesn’t work out for me here, I think that, as any manager of any race, I think you’re always in a position where it’s difficult to get another job,’ he said. QPR travel to face West Bromwich Albion after disappointingly losing at home to Everton last time out . Aaron Lennon is congratulated by his team-mates at Loftus Road as the QPR players head for the half-way line . ‘As a black man, I think it’s always going to be difficult anyway. I think the Rooney Rule is an important factor as there’s an awareness that something has to be done to affect the way people think in boardrooms. ‘I’m not just talking about race, I’m talking about gender, homophobia and other issues. I think there needs to be more awareness of factors that affect why people get jobs or not.’
A 16-year-old who was born a girl but identifies as a boy has been granted the opportunity to go through male puberty after years of living in misery. The transgender boy, who has felt as though he is living in the wrong body since he was a child, has been given permission by a Brisbane-based judge to receive testosterone injections, the Courier Mail reports. During a Family Court hearing, judge Michael Kent was told the teen had considered suicide and gone to extreme lengths such as binding his chest by wearing tight bras and starving himself because he was so unhappy in his female body. The teen has been taking puberty blockers for a year, has worn a boy’s uniform for two years and most of his friends are male. ‘I had the mentality of a dude... not the mentality of a girl,’ the teen told her therapist during a counselling session, the court heard. Scroll down for video . A 16-year-old who was born a girl but identifies as a boy has been granted the opportunity to go through male puberty thanks to hormone treatment . The Queensland teen is just one of many young Australians who have to seek permission from the Family Court and prove they are making an ‘independent’ choice before they can be granted second-stage gender-changing hormones. Currently a child wishing to change gender has to apply to the Family Court for this second stage of treatment after they have first taken puberty blocking hormones. Before a child is given any treatment at all they are assessed by at least five doctors. An official diagnosis of gender dysphoria, which describes people who are significantly unhappy with the sex and gender they were assigned at birth, also needs to be given by psychologists and physicians. Family Courts then assess the extent to which a child’s wishes “reflect true, stable and independent choices” – using the Gillick competency test - before they grant permission for gender-changing hormones. A child wishing to change gender has to apply to the Family Court for the second stage of gender changing treatment . Teens must be 16 years old before they can go to court to ask for this second stage of treatment. In Australia, that task is said to be made easier through the appointment of independent children’s lawyers and the commissioning of family reports, as well as through the use of expert evidence. However, in November 2014, Family Court Chief Justice Diana Bryant told the ABC’s Four Corners documentary that she would like an examination into whether courts needed to be involved at all. In the show, Jamie, a 14-year-old transgender girl, agreed:‘I don't think it's necessary that we have to go back to the court so they can decide if I'm Gillick competent, because that's just up to the parents and doctors I think. ‘They will make just as good a decision as anybody, even better because they're the experts.’ If you or anyone you know is in need of support, contact Lifeline Australia on 13 11 14, Kids Helpline on 1800 55 1800 or visit BeyondBlue.
Billionaire Phones4U founder John Caudwell has revealed that his £10million mansion is 'being haunted' by the 'ghost' of a child killed in the English Civil War. Mr Caudwell, 62, claimed visitors to his 50-room Jacobean manor in Staffordshire have felt a bed vibrate and a ghost brushing past them on the stairs. The businessman believes the ghostly goings-on are being caused by the spirit of a terrified little boy who died in the 17th century conflict. Scroll down for video . Spooked: Billionaire John Caudwell inside his historic mansion. He thinks the imposing building is being haunted by the ghost of a boy who was shot by a soldier loyal to Cromwell during the English Civil War . Spooky stays: Women visitors spending the night in one particular bedroom in the mansion (above) have felt its bed vibrate. Tycoon John Caudwell says the room is where the boy died . Mr Caudwell, who sold off Phones4U in 2006 for £1.4billion, said: 'The little boy was alone in the house. All the men had gone out hunting - and the Cromwellians came down the drive. 'He shouted: 'We are for the king' - and one of the soldiers lifted a musket and shot him dead. 'He fell in the Long Gallery, crawled into one of the bedrooms and bled to death. 'Legend has it that every so often, those blood stains come oozing through. 'I've never seen that but there's a strange thing where several women have slept in the room and felt the bed vibrate. I was not there at the time. 'There are also stories about this ghost brushing past people on the stairs. 'People who think they are in tune with the spirit world always say they can feel something - but it's warm, not malevolent.'

Mixing with the stars: John and Claire with singer Stephen Gately at a charity ball in May 2009, just five months before the Boyzone singer was found dead at his holiday apartment in Majorca . Historic: Broughton Hall in Staffordshire was the scene of a Civil War tragedy according to Mr Caudwell . The English Civil War took place between 1642 and 1651. It was fought by the Cavaliers - who remained loyal to King Charles I - and the Roundheads, who wanted to overthrow the monarchy. Their battles saw Charles I being executed, his son, Charles II, being exiled and Oliver Cromwell taking over as the leader of a republic Britain in 1649. Cromwell died in 1958 from suspected septicemia - and he was buried with great pomp at Westminster Abbey. But in 1661, a year after the monarchy was restored, his body was exhumed and subjected to a 'posthumous execution'. Mr Caudwell, who is ranked as the 42nd richest person in Britain, bought Broughton Hall 20 years ago for £800,000. The house and its 28-acres, which are near Eccleshall, are now worth more than £10million. The businessman started work at the age of 17 on the production line of the Michelin factory in his home city, Stoke-on-Trent, for just £3 a week. He began his mobile-phone empire in 1987. Earlier this month he spent £155million buying the Audley Street garage in Mayfair, central London. He plans to knock it down and build a high-end housing complex worth as much as £2billion. The apartment block will contain five townhouses, three penthouses, a mews home and 21 luxury flats - rivalling properties such as the nearby One Hyde Park for the title of the world's most desirable living space. Mr Caudwell also made headlines earlier this year when he was granted planning permission to build his own steam railway in the grounds of Broughton Hall. Mr Caudwell at the mansion in 2009. He has lived there for 20 years after making his money from the mobile-phone company Phones4U. A half-sized locomotive will haul a fleet of fully furnished carriages, at an initial cost of £500,000. Mr Caudwell said at the time: 'It's a mad idea - crackpot really. I'll probably only use the railway two or three times a year but I've had a fascination with steam trains since I was a boy.' No doubt they will be enjoyed by his family of five children by three women. He split from his last long-term partner, Claire Johnson, last year. The couple had been together for 15 years and remain friends. Mr Caudwell is also friends with his former wife Kate, to whom he was married for 25 years. There are several family suites in Broughton Hall to accommodate them and Mr Caudwell's other visitors. He also has an £80million mansion in Mayfair and two luxury ski chalets - one in Vail, in the US, and the other in Whistler, Canada.
The flag-burning father of a runaway British jihadi schoolgirl yesterday admitted taking his daughter to an extremist rally when she was 13. Abase Hussen – who blamed police for failing to stop his daughter fleeing to join IS earlier this year – conceded the teenager was ‘maybe’ influenced by the rally organised by banned terror group Al-Muhajiroun. Mr Hussen told MPs last month, after his daughter Amira Abase fled to Syria aged 15, that he could think of ‘nothing’ to explain why she and two friends had decided to join IS, as well as keeping quiet about his own links to radicalism. Scroll down for video . Abase Hussen, left, took his daughter Amira, right, to a demonstration when she was aged just 13 . Abase Hussen, circled,  marched at the head of a violent rally held by Muslim extremists in London in 2012 . It then emerged he had been in caught in shocking video footage amid a flag-burning mob, screaming in rage at a protest outside the US embassy in London, in 2012. Also at the rally were hate cleric Anjem Choudary and Michael Adebowale, one of the killers of Fusilier Lee Rigby. He has now apologised for attending, but admitted going to two further rallies – with his impressionable daughter in tow. One took place outside the Saudi embassy in London, in 2013, and is said to have been organised by the Islamic extremist group Al-Muhajiroun, founded by hate cleric Omar Bakri Mohammed and linked to many Islamic terror atrocities of the past decade. Yesterday Mr Hussen, who went to this rally and another similar one with his daughter and wife Fetia, conceded they might have influenced the youngster, who would have been 13 at the time. ‘The only reason we took her first time, was because there was no one to look after her and we both felt it important to go,’ he said. The rally was held against the treatment of Ethiopians in Saudi Arabia after human rights violations, and Mr Hussen, 47, who is from Ethiopia, said: ‘We both lost many people back home, we wanted to try to get help for people back home, too many human rights violations there. Many died. Maybe it influenced her.’ Amira was one of three girls from Bethnal Green Academy in East London who flew to Turkey before being smuggled across the border into Syria in February. Soon after, in an extraordinary exchange at the home affairs select committee, Mr Hussen blamed the authorities for failing to stop his daughter running off to Syria. Asked by chairman Keith Vaz if Amira had been exposed to any extremism, Mr Hussen replied: ‘Not at all. Nothing.’ Yesterday respected analyst Shiraz Maher, senior fellow at The International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at King’s College London, tweeted: ‘Remember that Amira Abase’s father blamed the police for his daughter going to Syria and effectively misled Parliament with this nonsense.’ Mr Hussen told The Times yesterday that he felt ashamed to have been at the flag-burning rally. He said: ‘I went to show my feelings because my religion was being insulted, my faith. Protesting is not radical, it is our right.’ Amira Abase, pictured, was one of three girls who flew from Gatwick to Turkey before crossing to Syria . Asked why he was pictured at the front of the mob, he said: ‘The crowd pushed me. I feel tricked. I did not know who they [the organisers] were. I just followed the crowd, I feel ashamed.’ Mr Hussen came to Britain from Germany in 1999 and said he came ‘for democracy, for the freedom, for a better life for children, so they could learn English’. He said he was upset with his daughter joining IS, saying she was ‘just a normal kid who is a victim of extremists’. Mr Hussen said he felt ‘terrible’ to know he had been protesting with one of Mr Rigby’s killers and said: ‘It was brutal, it has nothing to do with Islam, it is not human. You don’t do things like this.’ Amira fled to become a ‘jihadi bride’ with her friends Shamima Begum, 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16. A fourth girl from their school, Sharmeena Begum, left for Syria in December. Giving evidence to the MPs’ committee, Mr Hussen accused police of not doing enough to warn him and other parents. Last night Tory MP Michael Ellis, who sits on the committee, said: ‘I would certainly be in favour of Mr Hussen being recalled to give him a full opportunity to explain what he clearly did not when he appeared before us. ‘It’s shocking and outrageous anyone would think it appropriate to take their 13-year-old to such a rally. But then to tell a House of Commons committee you have no idea why a young teenager should seek to travel to Syria, when you have taken her to more than one of these events, is simply breathtaking.’

A man has been jailed after fathering a child with his own daughter who he raped repeatedly from when she was aged just 10 (file image) A man has been jailed for life after fathering a child with his own daughter who he raped repeatedly from when she was just 10. The man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was given a life sentence after Derby Crown Court after jurors heard how he 'took his daughter's life' through sexual abuse. His depravity was exposed when he impregnated her when she was just a teenager, having 'poisoned' the girl against her mother. As she watched her abuser being led away from the dock the girl ran towards him, crying out: 'I love you and miss you.' Earlier the court heard how her father had been her primary carer for years and began raping her when he felt 'out of sorts or angry'. Despite promising to stop the abuse after each attack, the man carried on abusing her until she became pregnant. In a bid to terminate the pregnancy without raising concern he encouraged his daughter to continue kick boxing, the court heard. Eventually, when the girl refused to tell authorities who the father of the baby was they ordered a paternity test. The pair fled but were apprehended by police and the man taken into custody. Giving evidence the girl told of how she was too scared to reported her father to police and still 'loved him'. 'The abuse has set my life on the wrong course and destroyed the normal childhood and teenage years that everyone deserves,' she said in a statement. 'I feared the consequences of disclosure because I love my dad. 'I know what he did was wrong, but I grew up with my dad by my side. 'I just wanted him to get help to make him better but unfortunately that never happened and it has come to this. 'It's come to me having a baby and to the father being my dad and to him being sentenced and my life falling apart.' The man, who earlier admitted rape, had 'poisoned' the girl against her mother who did not live with them, the court heard. Applying the same sentence as is handed to murderers, Judge Stuart Rafferty QC told the man: 'You took your daughter's life.' Jailing him for a minimum term of 15 years, he said: 'It's difficult to find words that could properly describe the extent of your deprivation and the damage that that deprivation has caused, not to a stranger but to your own daughter. 'Children do not ask to be born. Children are entitled to expect the best from their parents, in terms of care and parental love, that they can possibly receive. 'You gave your daughter a warped variation of that, a variation that suited you, not her. 'And, although I know you have to serve a prison sentence for that, the sentence you imposed upon her is a far greater one.' He added the girl has been consigned 'to a life of darkness'. 'She loved you, as any child loves its parents, and although people may think it strange, she loves you still - that's what children do.' The man was sentenced to life imprisonment at Derby Crown Court (above). His daughter cried: 'I love you' as he was led way from the dock .
A 46-year-old man was sentenced to life in prison on Monday after shooting dead a father and son because they were related to a driver who killed his nine-year-old sister in a crash 45 years ago. Alfred Guy Vuozzo swore loudly as he was told he would not be eligible for parole for 35 years for murdering Brent McGuigan, 68, and his son, Brendon, 39, on Prince Edward Island last August. As he was escorted from the courtroom, he screamed: 'You've sentenced me to life and I sent them to death', while the judge called the brutal double-murder an act of 'hatred and misdirected vengeance'. Vuozzo was two years old when his older sister, Cathy, was killed in a crash in 1970. Brent's father, Herbert, who was behind the wheel, later received a nine-month sentence for dangerous driving.

'Revenge': Alfred Guy Vuozzo, 46, has been sentenced to life in prison after shooting dead Brent McGuigan, 68, and his son, Brendon (both pictured), 39, because they were related to a driver who killed his nine-year-old sister in a crash 45 years ago. The defendant was told that he will not be eligible for parole for 35 years . Crash: Vuozzo was two years old when his older sister, Cathy, was killed in a crash in 1970. Brent's father, Herbert, who was behind the wheel, received a nine-month sentence. Above, a newspaper photo of the crash . After more than 40 years of torment, Vuozzo confronted the driver's son, Brent, and grandson, Brendon, in their home on St Mary's Road, near the town of Montague, CTV News reported. He shot them both in 'execution-style' killings to avenge his sister's death - despite neither victim having had anything to do with the crash that had claimed the life of his sibling all those years ago. In February, Vuozzo pleaded guilty to the first-degree murder of Brent and the second-degree murder of Brendon. At the time, he told the court that when Cathy was killed, 'Our lives were ruined'. He added he had needed to do something for her. 'Call me a cold-blooded killer, but I'm not,' he said. Before his sentencing on Monday, Vuozzo said Herbert's 'short' sentence 'has haunted me all my life', saying: 'That's all her life was worth. She only had nine years in this world. And nobody cared.' Shooting: After more than 40 years of torment, Vuozzo confronted the driver's son, Brent, and grandson, Brendon, in their home near Montague, Prince Edward Island, and shot them. Above, police at the scene . Emergency vehicle: He killed both in 'execution-style' slayings to avenge his sister's death - despite neither victim having had anything to do with the car crash that claimed the life of his sibling all those years ago . However, Crown lawyer John Diamond told the provincial Supreme Court in Charlottetown that Vuozzo was a 'cold-hearted' murderer who had shot his victims with a handgun to get 'revenge'. 'It was revenge. He was a cold-hearted and calculated individual,' he told the court, CBC reported. Mr Diamond also called the double-murder on August 20 'callous', 'pointless', and the worst crime in the Island's history, adding that it has caused life-long pain for surviving McGuigan family members. In a victim impact statement, Brent's wife and Brendon's mother, Marie McGuigan, who was home at the time but was not targeted by a hell-bent Vuozzo, said 'a part of me died with them that night'. Attack: In February, Vuozzo pleaded guilty to the first-degree murder of Brent and the second-degree murder of Brendon. He said that when Cathy was killed, 'Our lives were ruined'. Above, the scene of the killings . Meanwhile, Brent's only daughter, Donna, said she has been consumed by hatred. 'I feel so much anger and hatred that it scares me. I hate that they died this way and it haunts me,' she sobbed. At an earlier hearing, Gerald Quinn, prosecuting, explained how Cathy had been fatally thrown from a car being driven by her father when it was struck by Mr McGuigan, who was driving a truck, in 1970. The youngster's father and two other children also received minor injuries in the crash, but Herbert was not injured, The Eastern Graphic reported. Cathy died on the scene near Commercial Road. Mr McGuigan has since passed away. Referring to Brent and Brendon, Quinn said: 'These two men, by all accounts, were good hard-working men, had no involvement whatsoever in the motor vehicle accident years ago, at all. He added: 'This gentlemen [Vuozzo] had no familiarity with them other than knowing who they were. He walked into the home and he shot them both multiple times and killed them.' Thane MacEachern, defending, argued that the defendant had no previous criminal record and had suffered from depression and mental illness prior to the shootings, according to CBC. Vuozzo, of Lower Montague, will be 81 by the time he is eligible for parole. The first 25 years' ineligibility are for his first-degree murder charge, while the other 10 years are for killing Brendon. In 2011, federal legislation was passed allowing courts to impose consecutive periods of parole ineligibility in cases where defendants have been convicted of multiple murders.
That little voice inside your head that tells you to keep eating is, in fact, simply a cluster of around 10,000 brain cells. Now scientists believe they have found tiny triggers inside those cells that give rise to this 'voice' and ruin a dieter's good intentions. The new research, done on fish and mice, could someday lead to pills that will be able to quieten that voice or increase its volume. The research focused on POMC neurons, which are a structure called the hypothalamus, that send and receive signals to regulate appetite. On the left, images of normal hypothalamus POMC cells from a developing mouse. On the right: when the gene for the transcription factor is deleted, the cells no longer make it . The research focused on POMC neurons, which are a structure called the hypothalamus, that send and receive signals to regulate appetite. When POMC neurons are absent, or not working properly, animals and humans grow dangerously obese. The new findings show in animals that the same thing happens when certain genetic triggers inside the POMC cells aren't working. The team, led by the University of Michigan, looked at how a protein called a transcription factor, and two small stretches of DNA called enhancers, act as triggers for the Pomc gene. All three regulate how often and when the POMC cells use the gene to create the signal molecules that then go out to the body. That little voice inside your head that tells you to keep eating is, in fact, simply a cluster of around 10,000 brain cells. Now scientists believe they have found tiny triggers inside those cells that give rise to this 'voice' 'The POMC region is a central node of the brain's means for regulating body weight, in response to influences from the hormone leptin,' said Malcom Low, a professor in the Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology. Like signal lights that show pilots the path to an airport runway, enhancers guide proteins toward the gene so it can be read. Located deep inside the brain, in a structure called the hypothalamus, the cluster of POMC neurons act as a control center for feelings of fullness or hunger. They take in signals from the body, and send out chemical signals to regulate appetite and eating. When POMC neurons are absent, or not working correctly, animals and humans grow dangerously obese. The latest research show in animals that the same thing happens when certain genetic triggers inside the POMC cells aren't working. The researchers found that the two enhancers act in ways that complement one another, both encouraging the expression of the Pomc gene at key times. Mice born without both of them became obese – as if their Pomc gene had been deactivated. The protein that latches on to the enhancer, called a transcription factor, is also vital. In the new PNAS paper, the researchers report that the transcription factor Islet 1, encoded by the Isl1 gene, plays this important role for POMC. When the researchers blocked cells of the hypothalamus from making Islet 1 halfway through pregnancy, the fetal mice failed to develop any POMC cells. 'Taken together, this work represents the first example of a neuron-specific gene in vertebrates where we have found both the enhancers and a shared transcription factor that control gene expression in the developing brain and then throughout the life span of the adult,' says Low. Looking to see if the same factors do the same thing in humans will be more complex – and there may be other enhancers and transcription factors involved. But in theory, it could be possible to find drugs to increase the production of Pomc gene products, or to help silence it. 'For humans, Pomc regulation may be part of the equation of weight control,' says Low. 'We don't know, but we think it likely, that it may be similar to the mouse model, where its role is like a dial, with a linear relationship between the amount of Pomc expression and the degree of obesity.'
Young father: Michael Owen was preparing for his daughter's fifth birthday when he was killed along with his friend Kyle Careford in East Sussex . Tributes have been paid to two young friends who tragically died after their car crashed into a church wall. The men, named locally as Michael Owen and Kyle Careford, were killed in the road accident in Crowborough, East Sussex in the early hours of Sunday morning. Mr Owen, 21, had just received news of a  job offer and was preparing for his daughter's fifth birthday when he was killed. His grieving family have spoken of how loved he was and say they still can't accept he's gone. Describing Mr Owen's relationship with his daughter Lily-Rose Iris, his father Stephen, 50, said: 'He was only 16 when he had her but he was responsible and loved her to bits. 'He was with her any second he could be. He was always so safe. Did something fail on the car or did they hit the curb?' Mr Owen's stepmother Sylvia added: 'Everybody loved him. He had so many friends and everyone's absolutely devastated. 'He was a lovely person and he was a brilliant father. 'Until we see him we can't accept it. We keep getting up in the night and looking for his car down the road.' Kyle Careford, the other man in the car, is thought to have died just days before turning 21. It is believed that one of the men lost control of the Renault Clio they were travelling in as it came round a bend, smashing into a church's stone wall before finishing on its roof. Skid marks lead up to an approximately ten metre long gap in a sandstone wall that was destroyed in the crash. Flowers and tributes have been left at the scene by family and friends. One heartbreaking card to Mr Owen reads: 'To daddy, I love you so much. I'm gonna miss you every day. Love u daddy. Lily and Josh.' Mr Owen was still at school when he fathered Lily-Rose with his former partner Lauren Molloy. A card signed by Lauren, believed to be Lily-Rose's mother Ms Molloy, read: 'I can't describe how heartbroken I am. I love you so much and so does our beautiful princess. 'You was an amazing dad and was always there for me. I'm so sorry I didn't let us be a family again. Tragic: Flowers and tributes have been left at the scene of the accident, which happened in front of a church . Crash scene: The wall hit by the car is almost completely demolished and there are skid marks on the road . 'If only I could turn back time I would take you back straight away. I will do everything for our daughter I promise and I will tell her how amazing you are.' The 21-year-old worked in book printing but on Friday he was told he had landed a new job in window screen repair at the same firm as his stepbrother Karl Rabbitt, 36. The brother of Mr Careford led tributes to the pair. In a card left at the scene, brother Ben wrote: 'I can't explain how I am feeling. When you left us this morning to be in God's arms you took a piece of me away. 'I'm not quite sure how to tell your niece Grace that her uncle Kyle is now in heaven. I'm sure he will treasure her Frozen onesie even more now.' Tributes have also been paid to the men on Facebook, with friend, Tyler Scales, writing: 'My deepest sympathy and thoughts go out to all those who have loved and lost. 'Be safe, and think about how lucky you really are. Life can be taken so quick it's unbelievable and very unfair. Big love to all those affected by the loss of life.' Another friend, Sheri Pitman added: 'RIP Kyle. You were such a good kid and never deserved that.' Both men were from Tunbridge Wells, Kent, not far from the crash scene. Moving: One of the many notes left by grieving friends and family at the scene of the crash . After hearing a loud bang, local residents quickly called the emergency services, but the men, who had suffered horrific injuries, are thought to have died instantly. Firefighters had to cut their bodies out of the mangled wreckage. There were no other cars involved in the crash. A spokesman for Sussex Police said: 'At about 12.40am on 12 April a collision occurred in Rotherfield Road, Crowborough. A Renault Clio collided with the wall of the church and overturned.

A spokesman for East Sussex Fire and Rescue Service added: 'We attended the scene and the car was on its roof. There were two young males trapped inside who were declared dead at the scene. 'We had to use cutting gear to get them out but they were already dead.'
The mother-of-three who dropped her two-year-old son into a cheetah pit is the assistant director of a childcare center. Michelle Schwab, who has three sons and a degree in therapeutic childcare, has been charged with child endangerment after  she allegedly dangled her child over the 10-foot-deep enclosure in Cleveland Metroparks Zoo before he slipped and fell. She faces six months in jail and a $1,000 fine. Visitors heard a scream at 3pm on Saturday and looked to see Schwab, 38, and her husband leaping into the pit to retrieve the child, who was treated for a leg injury. On Monday, a spokesman for KinderCare, a nationally-acclaimed education, care and resource provider, confirmed Schwab has taken a leave of absence from her management role at one of the centers in Columbus, Ohio.

She is an assistant director at KinderCare . Witnesses say Schwab jumped in to retrieve the boy from the compound at Cleveland Metroparks Zoo at 3pm on Saturday. The animals appeared to ignore the boy, witnesses say (file image of one of the zoo's cheetahs) The boy was rescued by his parents from the pit (pictured) before firefighters and paramedics arrived on the scene. He suffered from minor bumps and bruises and was listed in stable condition at the hospital . In an email to DailyMail.com, spokesman Colleen Moran said: 'We were saddened to hear of Saturday’s incident at the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo involving Michelle Schwab’s son, and we wish him a speedy recovery. 'Ms Schwab has been the Assistant Director at the Sawmill Road KinderCare in Columbus. She is currently home with her family, and will remain out of our center while this issue is investigated and addressed. 'In addition to the agencies looking into this issue, we are looking into the incident further ourselves, as we closely examine issues involving the treatment of children by our employees, even if those incidents arise outside of our centers.' Schwab, of Delaware, Ohio, was charged on Monday in Cleveland Municipal Court and will be arraigned on April 22. On Sunday, Dr Christopher Kuhar, executive director at the zoo, said the two felines did not approach the boy when he fell in the pit. Michael Lurie and his family were at the Cheetah exhibit when they heard the child scream. 'You saw how far the drop was and you just couldn't believe the kid didn't hurt himself from falling down on the ground,' Lurie told WKYC. 'I was just shocked,' he said. 'I didn't understand how the parents let the kid go over the thing.' Zoo visitor Terra Lurie believes the boy was not approached by the fast feline because they were frightened. 'I think they were just curious as to what was going on and why somebody was in the pen with them,' she said. 'It's not every day that somebody is just in the pen with them.' 'And everyone else is screaming and they probably got scared.' The exhibit was closed following the child's fall. Zoo visitor Michael Lurie was at the cheetah exhibit when he heard the child scream. He said he was 'shocked' and 'didn't understand how the parents let the kid' go over the railing and into the pit .

A recent cyber-attack on the State Department was reportedly carried out by high-level Russia hackers who also penetrated restricted parts of the White House computer system, such as the president's private schedule. CNN reported Tuesday, citing US officials briefed on the months-long investigation conducted by the FBI and Secret Service, that the hackers were able to access real-time, non-public schedule of President Obama, which is regarded as highly sensitive information that is sought after by foreign intelligence agencies. In October 2014, the White House acknowledged that there had been suspicious activity on its unclassified network serving the executive office, prompting system shutdowns and security upgrades. Vulnerable: A new report has revealed that Russian hackers launched a cyber-attack against White House's unclassified computer network last year . Privacy concerns: The hackers reportedly accessed President Obama's non-public schedule, which is considered highly sensitive information . Sneak attack: According to federal officials involved in the probe, the hackers wormed their way into the White House system by breaching first the State Department's network . A six-month investigation into the breach, described as one of the most sophisticated attacks against the US, reportedly uncovered evidence pointing to hackers working on behalf of Russian President Vladimir Putin's government. According to federal officials involved in the probe, the hackers wormed their way into the White House system by breaching first the State Department's network. To accomplish this task, the cyber-bandits allegedly working for the Kremlin commandeered a State Department email account and sent a phishing email to someone at the White House designed to trick the recipient into downloading malicious software. Silver lining: White House deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said last year's cyber intrusions that did not affect classified information . Once downloaded onto a White House computer, the malware presumably allowed the hackers to penetrate the unclassified network containing Obama's schedule that is not accessible to the general public. According to an anonymous government official, the hackers have been able to re-enter the State Department computer system, despite efforts to keep them out. The Russian Embassy did not publicly comment on the hacking allegations . The White House responded to CNN’s revelations by saying the report did not refer to a new incident but was ‘speculating’ about the source of cyber activities that were disclosed last year. Spokesman Mark Stroh said in a statement that the White House would not comment on CNN's attribution of the cyber-attack to Russian hackers. ‘Any such activity is something we take very seriously. In this case, as we made clear at the time, we took immediate measures to evaluate and mitigate the activity,’ Stroh stated. ‘As has been our position, we are not going to comment on the referenced article's attribution to specific actors.’ White House deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said in an appearance on CNN Tuesday that the White House in 2014 disclosed cyber intrusions that did not affect classified information. ‘We have an unclassified system and then we have a classified system, a top secret system,’ Rhodes said. ‘We do not believe that our classified systems were compromised.’ But he said, ‘There's always vulnerability.’ For that reason, Rhodes said the White House operates a separate, secure system for classified data. He assured the public that the White House takes regular actions to prevent intrusions on its unclassified network.
The world's last surviving male northern white rhino - stripped of his horn for his own safety - is now under 24-hour armed guard in a desperate final bid to save the species. Sudan is guarded day and night by a group of rangers who risk their lives on a daily basis as they try to keep the rhino from poachers lured by the rising price of ivory. But even without his horn, keepers in the Kenyan reserve of Ol Pojeta in fear for his safety. Scroll down for video . Guard: The rangers keep an armed watch around Sudan at all times to deter poachers after his horn . Extreme measures: Rangers have even cut off the rhino's horn - but they fear it won't be enough . Hungry: Feeding time in Sudan's enclosure - he spent most of his life in a Czech zoo . Dangerous: The rangers are aware they are risking their lives to protect the enormous animal . The 43-year-old rhino - who could live until his 50s - is the last chance for any future northern white rhino calves. Sudan was moved, along with two female rhinos, from a zoo in the Czech Republic in December 2009. The reserve, which specialises in the conservation of rhinos, was chosen because of its successful breeding programme with black rhinos. It had been hoped the move would encourage them to breed, but all attempts have been unsuccessful. The project was dealt a further blow when Suni - the world's only other male, who also lived at Ol Pojeta - died last October. It left just five northern white rhinos in the world - and the three in Kenya are in particular danger. Hunted: Rhinos like Sudan have no predators in the wild because of their size - apart from humans . New home: It had been hoped moving Sudan to Kenya with two females would encourage them to breed . Simor Irungu, one of the rangers who guards Sudan, says the team regularly risk their lives to keep him safe. 'With the rising demand for rhino horn and ivory, we face many poaching attempts and while we manage to counter a large number of these, we often risk our lives in the line of duty.' It is a sad end for a species which used to roam across the heart of Africa - from southern Chad, across the Democratic Republic of Congo and up into Sudan. Just over half a century ago, there were 2,000 northern white rhinos; but 1984 there were only 15, all in the DRC, according to the World Wildlife Fund. But then conservationist managed to bring them back from the brink, and bought the population up to at least 30 animals less than a decade later. Failure: But attempts at breeding have been unsuccessful - and Sudan is now getting old . High value: The price of ivory is now said to be between £40,000 and £47,000 a kilo . But then poaching took its toll, and the entire park was emptied. The last northern white rhinos were spotted in 2006. Their extinction has been fueled by the growing demand for ivory, which comes in large part from the Far East, where it is believed to be a cure for several ailments. The price for ivory has risen from between £170 to £541 per kilo in the 1990s, to today's prices of £40,000 to £47,355 per kilo, according to a report by the International Fund for Animal Welfare. The rangers have taken steps to deter the poachers, but they still fear it may not be enough. Elodie Sampere explained: 'The only reason his horn has been cut off is to deter poachers. 'If the rhino has no horn, he is of no interest to them. 'This is purely to keep him safe.' Sad end: Sudan is one of five northern white rhinos left, and a number of them are his descedents . However, keeping them safe is a costly business: the team of 40 cost £75,000 for six months. It is usually paid for with money made from tourism, but recent instability in Kenya, and fear of Ebola - which is actually thousands of miles away - have kept people away. So the team at  Ol Pejeta is hoping to raise the money through crowd funding. 'Keeping the ranger team safe is expensive,' the appeal reads. 'They are given world-class training, and are kitted out with the latest in equipment and support, from night vision goggles to GPS tracking, to a team of tracking and support dogs.... 'Keeping the team funded and equipped is an ongoing challenge. 'We are aiming to raise enough to safeguard the wages for the forty strong team for the next six months. 'This is £75,000. Any which way, every single pound contributed will help secure the rangers, that secure the rhino, for us and for future generations.' To donate, visit Ol Pejeta's GoFundMe page.

Australia's most notorious serial killer could have been caught before he murdered seven backpackers, had the 'wrong man' not been sent to prison, a new investigation has claimed. Channel Seven's Sunday Night will tell the story of Ivan Milat's first violent crime and how he escaped police prosecution, before going on to butcher seven backpackers. The revelation includes first-hand evidence from Milat's older brother, Boris, into the killer's 'secret victim'. Scroll down for video . A new report claims Ivan Milat, Australia's most notorious serial killer, could have been caught before he murdered seven backpackers . Boris Milat shares a secret he has kept for 52 years, which details how Australia's bloodiest butcher was responsible for the shooting more than two decades before the first backpacker murder in 1989, according to the report. The program also puts Mr Milat face-to-face with the 'wrong man', who was jailed for the first crime his brother committed. 'Don't hold yourself responsible,' the man, who Channel Seven has not yet named, tells Mr Milat, as they shake hands. According to the timeline presented by the program and Mr Milat, his murderous brother would have been a 19-year-old when he claimed his first victim. Former Detective Paul Gordon tells the program the evidence uncovered is 'unbelievable' and 'incredible'. Boris Milat tells the program a secret about his brother he had kept for more than 52 years . Milat was later sentenced to life in prison, but if the 'wrong man' (right) had not been jailed for his first crime, Milat's victims could have been saved, the program claims . 'Don't hold yourself responsible,' the man imprisoned for Milat's first violent crime told the killer's brother, Boris . Milat, 70, was convicted of butchering seven young people between 1989 and 1992 and burying their bodies in the Belanglo State Forest in southern NSW. He has been locked up in Goulburn's Supermax jail for almost 20 years. The first two bodies of Milat’s victims were discovered on September 19 and 20 1992, when two runners found a decaying corpse in the Belanglo State Forest. According to claims made by the program, Milat would have been about 19 when he claimed his first victim .

Former Detective Paul Gordon (right) tells the program the evidence uncovered is 'unbelievable' and 'incredible' The report claims Milat's seven victims could have been saved if he had been been held accountable for this first chilling crime . Police later confirmed the bodies were of missing British backpackers Caroline Clarke and Joanne Walters. Walters had been stabbed 35 times and Clarke had been shot 10 times in the head. The grim finds were just the beginning of a long and extensive search which resulted in the bodies of Australians Deborah Everist and James Gibson being found in October 1993, followed by Simone Schmidl’s stabbed body in November of the same year. The decapitated body of German backpacker Anja Habschied was then found along with her boyfriend Gabor Neugebauer on 3 November 1993 in shallow graves 50 metres apart. British backpacker Caroline Clarke had been shot 10 times in the head when police found her body .

The evil killer has penned a series of rambling letters while behind bars, according to a book released by his eldest nephew, Alistair Shipsey. The Milat Letters, is a compilation of 94 notes from Milat to his eldest nephew Alistair Shipsey. Milat is serving seven consecutive life sentences for the murders of seven backpackers in  NSW between 1989 and 1992. In the letters, he tells Shipsey about his 'fair share' of 'sheilas', who write 'some frightening things' - and one woman who has even proposed. Australia's worst serial killer Ivan Milat kept trophies to remind him of each murder . Milat butchered and buried the bodies of seven young people between 1989 and 1992 in the Belanglo State Forest in southern NSW . 'Every month someone new writes; the latest one was from Texas. She tells me she’s 25, white. I ought to ask her “why” as she only knows me from a website, and there’s nothing nice about me on it,' one of the letters reads. 'As you know there are a lot of wackos out there as well. A lot of them write to me at times. I tell you Al, there are some real crazy people out and about.' Milat has been a troublesome inmate during his time in prison, and it is believed he planned at least one escape and swallowed metal objects in an attempt to get out of jail. An extract from one of the letters from Milat, written before he chopped his own finger off with a plastic knife in January 2009, affectionately refers to Shipsey as 'Al .

Milat tried to send his finger it in a padded envelope to the High Court. The full story,The Ivan Milat Secret, will air on Channel 7 at 8:30pm on Sunday.
Most people might believe that being covered in face tattoos would make it impossible to land a job; but for one inked-up Canadian man the decision to cover his head, neck and arms in crude body art has actually earned him a lucrative career as a model. Vin Los, 24, gained notoriety last year for his tattoo-covered visage and his dreams of becoming the most famous man in the world; despite facing heavy criticism about his unique ink, Vin insisted that the Sharpie-like tattoos on his face, neck, chest, and arms 'embody pop culture', create 'a myth, a mystery' and would one day help him to achieve his goal of global fame. And while many may have doubted his chances of succeeding, it seems his unique look has actually started to pay off, as the Montreal-based model has landed a campaign for underwear brand Garçon Model. Scroll down for video . Inked in his underwear: Vin Loss, 24, stars in a new campaign for underwear brand Garçon Model that showcases his extensive body art . Baring it all: Modeling underwear allows Vin to show off his many tattoos, which include the names of cities like Baghdad, San Francisco, New York, and Kuala Luampur . The ads, which feature Vin posing in boxer briefs, put his tattoos on full display, spotlighting phrases like 'scream my name', 'iconic face', and 'my man is str8', as well as tattooed-on chest hair. 'You could look at me in a hundred years from now and really get the idea of what pop culture was like in the early 2010s,' he told Vice last year, adding that the words and phrases he chooses are inspired by YouTube songs, places, and other 'superficial' things. 'I want to be an image for people to look at, something that has an impact,' he says. 'Everybody who sees me is bound to ask questions: “Why fame? What’s his life like?”' Art history: Vin says he got his first tattoo around the age of 16; it's the logo for Le Coq Sportif on his chest . Flashing his fame: One of his most prominent tattoos, the word 'fame' written across his forehead summarizes Vin's biggest goal . Vin's extensive body art has taken him years to cultivate — while he now has 24 tattoos on his face and others on his arms, neck, chest, legs, and stomach, he started with a single rendering of the Le Coq Sportif logo when he was 16. He also insists that his tattoos are real, and has gone so far as to prove the designs are permanent by filming himself washing up, in order to show that the ink doesn’t come off when scrubbed. 'If I was indecisive, I don’t think I would write on my face,' he explains. Don't forget this face: Vin likes that his many tattoos make him memorable and thinks they make him a 'myth' and a 'mystery' Adding them up: Vin has 24 tattoos on his face alone, including the words 'guilty', 'play', and 'famous' Before breaking into modeling, Vin worked at a supermarket where he says he 'wanted to die'; now he hopes to build an empire and bring a paparazzi culture to his hometown of Montreal because he is disappointed that the city doesn't have a 'star system'. He also designs wallets, which he sells for $98 on his newly-launched website. Vin is not the first heavily-tattooed model to use his body art to earn modelling gigs; photographer Christian Saint recently released a book called Tattoo Super Models that features women covered in ink.
Paige VanZant and Felice Herrig had to be pulled apart as they squared off ahead of their strawweight clash in New Jersey. VanZant, at only 21 and with just five fights behind her, has already ruffled feathers after being one of a select few to sign an individual contract with Reebok. And Herrig was clearly riled during the traditional staredown in Times Square. Felice Herrig and Paige VanZant face off during the  weigh-in . Herrig and VanZant will face each other in the Octagon on Saturday night . VanZant steps on the scale during the UFC Fight Night weigh-in event at the Prudential Center . VanZant fights for the second time under the UFC banner when she takes on Felice Herrig . VanZant and Herrig had to be separated after getting too close during the traditional staredown . At 21, VanZant has been hyped as the UFC's next big thing despite only having fought five times . She said: 'I think I'm a better striker than Paige, a better grappler than Paige, I have a better submission skill set than Paige, I'm stronger than Paige and more athletic than Paige so I believe I'll be able to take the fight wherever I want to. 'I'm glad Paige has a lot of hype around her because I feel when I beat her it will make the victory that much sweeter and feel that much more rewarding and it will make people respect me more.' At only 21 and with just five professional fights to her name, VanZant has enjoyed a spectacular rise since her first bout in 2012. After three wins and a decision defeat, she was signed by the UFC for the newly-formed 115lb division and initially selected to appear on the Ultimate Fighter. But due to her being under 21 at the time, she was unable to take part and instead made her debut against Kailin Curran last November, stopping the 24-year-old in the third and final round. 'It's very surreal,' VanZant said. 'Even the fact I'm part of the UFC is a huge experience. It's a blessing and I don't think it will set in for a very long time. VanZant admitted it feels surreal to be part of the UFC having made her debut aged 20 . VanZant works out in the week of her next fight, against Herrig in New Jersey on Saturday night . VanZant made a winning start to her UFC career, stopping Kailin Curran in the third round . 'We were backstage at one of the other weigh-ins and someone threw it out, would you fight Felice Herrig and I said yeah and took the fight right away. 'I'm very excited about the match-up, stylistically it's a good one for me. 'As of right now, the only thing on my mind is winning this fight. I hope to win every fight the UFC offers me and see where this crazy journey can take me'. VanZant has a realistic chance of becoming the UFC's youngest-ever champion. That record belongs to light-heavyweight Jon Jones who won the title in 2011 aged 23. 'Obviously, that would be huge, and that would be awesome; I try not to think about it and try not to focus on setting records,' she told MMAjunkie. 'I strictly want to beat every opponent I face whether it's for a title or for a small show. The only thing for me is winning my fights and being the best athlete I can be.' Victory for VanZant will take her closer to a title shot as she bids to become the youngest-ever champion .
Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini has warned his side must overcome a difficult obstacle at Crystal Palace to avoid losing yet more ground to their rivals. Fading champions City had to watch in frustration on Saturday, not only as Chelsea extended their lead at the top of the Barclays Premier League, but as Arsenal and Manchester United shunted them down to fourth. Slipping to such a position was not in the script when City pulled level with Chelsea on New Year's Day and any further slips would increase the pressure on Pellegrini significantly. Manuel Pellegrini has warned his side must overcome a difficult obstacle at Crystal Palace . Manchester City manager Pellegrini does not want his side to lose any more ground in the race for the title . With the Manchester derby coming next week, City can ill afford to drop points at Selhurst Park on Monday but Pellegrini knows the Eagles have become a tough proposition under Alan Pardew. Pellegrini said: 'Maybe they are playing different. They are in a good moment and they are playing with a lot of trust. 'With the other manager also Crystal Palace was a difficult team, but now they are playing at home.' City laboured to a 3-0 win over Palace at the Etihad Stadium in December in what proved Neil Warnock's penultimate match in charge. Pardew was appointed early in the new year and since then they have proved highly resilient, losing just three times in the Premier League and removing relegation fears. The Monday fixture has meant both sides have had to be patient for their return to action after the international break. It is a wait that could have been advantageous in terms of extra rest had their rivals lost over the weekend. Manchester City players celebrate scoring against West Bromwich Albion in their last match . Pellegrini knows hisside can ill afford to fall further behind Chelsea in the Premier League title race . Pellegrini (left) will try to close the gap between his team and Chelsea at the top of the Premier League . It has not turned out that way with Saturday's positive results for Chelsea, Arsenal and United turning the heat up on City, but Pellegrini claims it does not make any difference. The Chilean said: 'I don't think we have excuses about those things. We are going to play the last game of this matchday but that doesn't matter. 'It is not an excuse and not an advantage. All the national players arrived back on Wednesday - most of them - so every team had three or four days to prepare. It is not so important.' Should Pablo Zabaleta feature for City it would come just two days after his wife gave birth to a son, Asier. Argentina international Zabaleta previously announced his wife's pregnancy to the wider world with a baby-themed goal celebration during a 4-1 win at Sunderland in December.
Britain faces a 'coalition of chaos' under Ed Miliband and Nicola Sturgeon, David Cameron warned today. The Prime Minister, who travelled to Glasgow this morning to unveil the Tory Party's Scottish manifesto, accused the SNP and Labour of posing a 'clear and present danger' to Britain. He said the two parties were pretending to 'slug it out' ahead of next month's poll – but insisted they were both working to ramp up spending regardless of the deficit. Scroll down for video . The Prime Minister, who travelled to Glasgow this morning to unveil the Tory Party's Scottish manifesto, accused the SNP and Labour of posing a 'clear and present danger' to Britain . Mr Cameron said Ed Miliband could now only become Prime Minister with the support of the SNP. He told activists: 'We meet here in Scotland in the middle of a massive political fight. We've got Labour and the SNP on opposite sides – slugging it out – but if you take a step back they're really on the same side. 'You have a weak Labour party, who want more spending, more borrowing, more debt and more taxes. And the people who will prop them up, the SNP – who want even more spending, more borrowing, more debt and more taxes.' Mr Cameron said together, the SNP and Labour 'pose a clear threat to the future of our United Kingdom', adding: 'A coalition of chaos.' He said: The SNP acting as the chain to Labour's wrecking ball, running right through our economic recovery - and it will be you who pays the price. With jobs losses, massive tax rises and an economy back on brink of bankruptcy.' Mr Cameron's blistering attack comes ahead of tonight's live TV election debates between the main 'challenger' parties - including Mr Miliband and Ms Sturgeon, alongside the leaders of Ukip, the Greens and Plaid Cymru. Mr Cameron walks with the leader of Scottish Conservatives as they launch the Tories' election manifesto today . David Cameron and Nick Clegg are not taking part because they have been in power for the last five years. Mr Miliband is expected to use the BBC debate to issue a warning to Scottish voters that success for the SNP north of the border could deliver a Conservative government in Westminster. The Labour leader has ruled out a formal coalition with the SNP in a hung Parliament, but he is likely to face calls from Ms Sturgeon to join a 'progressive alliance' to bring an immediate end to austerity, which is also backed by Plaid and the Greens. Nicola Sturgeon has called on Ed Miliband to work with the SNP to 'lock out' David Cameron from Number 10 . Conservatives are hoping that the debate would give added bite to their claim that a Miliband administration would be 'in the pocket' of the SNP. Tory deputy chief whip Greg Hands said: 'Will we see the alternative to David Cameron in the Challengers Debate? A Frankenstein coalition to bankrupt and break up Britain.' Mr Clegg, who was campaigning in the north-west, said he asked to take part in the debate, but was 'denied the opportunity' by broadcasters. The Liberal Democrat leader told LBC radio: 'David Cameron, I know, didn't want to participate in it, but I don't see why I should have been denied the opportunity to put the side of the story of what the coalition government has done, even if he didn't want to. 'I find it very odd that the debate tonight doesn't have anybody from one of the parties that have actually been trying to govern our country.' Ms Sturgeon said the debate was 'a fantastic moment of opportunity to deliver the positive change that people are looking for'. 'The SNP will be a positive and constructive voice at Westminster, ready to join others in a progressive alliance to end austerity and protect vital public services like the NHS.' Calling on Mr Miliband to 'change direction', Ms Wood said: 'We're calling for an end to austerity and instead balancing the books through job creation and infrastructure investment. 'It's time weapons of mass destruction were confined to history and we divert funds to improve standards of living and prospects for people.' In the debate, each of the five leaders will be allowed a short opening statement before Dimbleby invites questions from 200 voters. Mr Miliband will be positioned to the far left next to Ms Wood and Mr Farage to the far right next to Ms Sturgeon with Ms Bennett in the middle of the group. The 90-minute programme will cover five subjects. Each question will see one-minute opening statements followed by 10 minutes of free debate.
England will no longer compete in the Victory Shield as the Football Association does not believe the competition suits the needs of its young players. Wayne Rooney, Sir Stanley Matthews, Duncan Edwards and Peter Shilton are all veterans of the long-contested Under 16 tournament between the different associations within the United Kingdom. England are the most successful team in the history of the Victory Shield, but it has been announced that they will not be fielding a side in the competition. The Football Association have taken the decision to withdraw from future Victory Shield tournaments . Wales are the current holders of the Victory Shield while England are the most successful country . 2010-11: England . 2011-12: England . 2012-13: England . 2013-14: Scotland . 2014-15: Wales . A statement from the Football Association says the move 'ensures consistency with a key element of the England DNA', with the move borne out of the desire to aid development by facing opposition from further afield. It is understood the decision has been sped up by Sky Sports' move to withdraw funding and propose an altered format, with Gareth Southgate, the FA's head of national teams at St George's Park, saying player development is the key reason. 'We are reviewing our fixture programme at all ages and it is important that with England we are able to give players an international experience that compliments their club development and attempts to expose them to something different,' he said. 'At Under 16 level we may only have the boys for between 10 to 15 matches per season. Within that programme, it's important to prioritise exposing them to European and world opposition. 'We feel that within their club programmes, they face many of the boys that they would face in the Victory Shield and so these fixtures, whilst competitive and exciting, do not expose our boys to different playing cultures. 'Although we recognise the historic interest in these matches, we are intent on maximising the football learning of our young players, while forming the programme of fixtures for the year around the crucial academic commitments our players face at this age group. 'We also feel that due to the changes in format, uncertainty around the Victory Shield and the potential changes suggested by Sky, it is a good time to review our fixtures and make an early decision so everyone can plan their 2015-16 fixtures with certainty.' Man United captain Wayne Rooney is among the players who made a name for himself at the Victory Shield . The Football Association's head of development Gareth Southgate put decision down to player development .

Yet another scientific study has found no link between autism and the vaccine against measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) - even among high risk children. The findings, in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), are based on a study of about 95,000 young people. All those in the study had older siblings. Some of the elder children had autism and some did not. Numerous studies over the last 15 years have ruled out a link between the MMR vaccine and autism . Since autism can run in families, researchers decided to look at whether vaccines could make autism even more likely in children who had siblings with autism. They found that vaccines had no effect on autism risk, whether or not a sibling in the family was diagnosed. 'Consistent with studies in other populations, we observed no association between MMR vaccination and increased ASD risk among privately insured children,' said the study, led by Anjali Jain, a doctor in Falls Church, Virginia. 'We also found no evidence that receipt of either one or two doses of MMR vaccination was associated with an increased risk of ASD among children who had older siblings with ASD.' Autism is on the rise, and affects as many as one in 68 children in the United States, but its causes remain poorly understood. Fears about vaccines and autism began to spread after the publication in 1998 of an article by Andrew Wakefield. He was later stripped of his medical license . Fears about vaccines and autism began to spread after the publication in 1998 of an article by Andrew Wakefield that purported to find a link between the MMR vaccine and autism in 12 children. It was later found to be fraudulent and was retracted by the journal that published it. As the author, Wakefield was stripped of his medical license. But concerns over vaccine safety, particularly in the Internet age, have proven difficult to quell. 'Although a substantial body of research over the last 15 years has found no link between the MMR vaccine and ASD, parents and others continue to associate the vaccine with ASD,' said the JAMA study. 'Surveys of parents who have children with ASD suggest that many believe the MMR vaccine was a contributing cause.' Children who have an older sibling with autism are less likely to get vaccinated, the study found. The MMR vaccination rate for the children with unaffected siblings was 92 percent by age five. In contrast, the MMR vaccination rates for children with older siblings with ASD was 86 percent by age five. An accompanying editorial by Bryan King, a doctor at the University of Washington and Seattle Children's Hospital, said the data is clear. 'The only conclusion that can be drawn from the study is that there is no signal to suggest a relationship between MMR and the development of autism in children with or without a sibling who has autism,' King wrote. 'Taken together, some dozen studies have now shown that the age of onset of ASD does not differ between vaccinated and unvaccinated children, the severity or course of ASD does not differ between vaccinated and unvaccinated children, and now the risk of ASD recurrence in families does not differ between vaccinated and unvaccinated children.'
A 13-year-old boy allegedly stole a $25,000 stack of cash from his own grandfather and handed out wads of notes to his school friends. The unnamed child from Medina, Ohio, gave out $100 notes in the classroom before going to a friend's house after school, where he also showered adults with cash, police said. The group of friends then reportedly went on a shopping spree after the mass giveaway, which began last Wednesday at the town's Claggett Middle School. Payday: The unnamed 13-year-old showered classmates with $100 notes at Claggett Middle School in Medina, Ohio . Medina police told the Akron Beacon Journal that the boy, who lives with his 83-year-old grandpa and his mom, swiped the money from the senior's bedside table. Cops began to crack down on the cash bonanza after teachers at the boy's school blew the whistle on the scheme, by which time the majority of the cash was gone. Officers said that, as well as the children themselves, some was spent by 'adults, guardians or associates of the children who received the money', according to the Medina Gazette. Dollar: The children, and adults who were also given money, went on a spending spree. Some $7,000 has been recovered . As of Saturday, police had recovered some $7,000 of the man's savings, as well as some of the items the boy and his friends had bought with it. Police said that prosecutors will file charges once they have determined exactly who was involved. T.J. Hellickson, the school's principal, would only say that the school is co-operating with law enforcement.
A female prison guard and the convict she helped escape have been caught after 19 days and 1,700 miles on the run. Rachel Chepulis, 26, was arrested with Wesley E. Brown III in North Bend, Oregon almost three weeks after she helped him break out of Lake Region Correctional Center, also known as Devils Lake, in North Dakota. 35-year-old Brown, who is married with children, was awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm - and is thought to have seduced single Chepulis while behind bars. Fugitive couple: Female prison guard Rachel Chepulis and felon Wesley E. Brown III have been captured in Oregon after she helped him escape from jail in North Dakota 19 days ago . His escape from Devils Lake on March 13., aided by Chepulis, is the second time he has broken out of a secure unit. In June 2013 he escaped from Heart of America Correctional Center, climbing over a fence at the prison's recreation area. On that occasion Brown was recaptured three hours later and transferred to Devils Lake prison, where he spent a considerable amount of time prior his second jail break in March. Dan Orr, chief deputy U.S. marshal for North Dakota, told the Daily News: 'It's clear in the time he was there they developed a relationship. That he was allowed to escape was assisted by the fact there were mistakes made by the jail. Caught: The pair managed to get 1,700 miles from the North Dakota jail before being captured in Oregon . 'He was classified at a lower level than he should have been considering he already escaped from another facility. And he had assistance from the female jailer. 'It was pretty clear the jail didn't realize what she had done. But once we began the investigation, we realized she had a direct involvement in the escape.' The Marshals Service relies on local jails to hold federal prisoners awaiting sentencing in North Dakota and during his time at Devils Lake, the convicted Brown must have befriended the single Chepulis, Mr Orr claimed. The fugitive couple was caught outside a Bi-Mart store in North Bend yesterday with the help of Oregon State Police, who tracked down Chepulis' 2015 Toyota Rav4 with North Dakota plates after a tip off from a nearby hotel. Chepulis, arrested as she returned to the vehicle, was found to have Brown's initials tattooed on her left ring finger. Married felon: Brown, who has a wife and childre, is thought to have befriended single Rachel Chepulis while locked up at Lake Region Correctional Center, also known as Devils Lake, in North Dakota, above . Brown is to face additional escape charges while Chepulis will be hit with instigating or assisting an escape, concealing a person from arrest and conspiracy to commit escape . Each charge carries a five-year prison sentence. The pair will be arraigned in Oregon, likely Thursday, and then held without bond as they face extradition to North Dakota. Mr Orr said he was unable to offer more details of the jail break or the couple's time on the run until the court affidavit is unsealed.
This is the embarrassing moment a Buckingham Palace guard slipped and fell on a manhole cover in front of hundreds of shocked tourists as he took up position in his sentry box. The Queen's Guard was left red-faced after he slipped on a manhole cover during the popular Changing of the Guard - and unfortunately for him the entire incident was caught on camera. He lost his footing and slid sideways, knocking his bearskin on the side of the box and dropping his rifle. The Queen's Guard (pictured) slipped on a manhole cover during the popular Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace last week. Unfortunately for him, the entire incident was caught on a tourist's camera . The embarrassed soldier quickly scrambled to his feet as his colleagues marched past as if nothing had happened. But the young guard started to blush as he peered at the crowd from under his bearskin and realised how many people had seen his slapstick moment. Holidaymaker David Meadwell recorded the unscheduled manouevre outside Buckingham Palace on Thursday afternoon. Mr Meadwell, 50, from Newcastle-upon-Tyne, said: 'I was with my family for a trip to London and I thought I'd take some pictures of the changing of the guards. Tourist David Meadwell shot this footage of the Changing of the Guard last week when the incident unfolded . The moment it all started to go wrong: The guard leans heavily to the side as he appears to slip . The unidentified young guard's legs appear to get a bit tangled as he tries to turn to march away . The guard, wearing full regalia, falls heavily to the floor still clutching his rifle following the slip up . 'The first group changed successfully, without any problems, and so I decided to video the next group doing it. 'I didn't expect anything like this to happen - he went flying. There were quite a few people around and there were a lot of gasps as he went down. 'I think he just slipped on a manhole cover, he looked so embarrassed.' The unnamed solider is thought to have slipped because of the metal protectors nailed to the soles of his boots. Tourists gather in their thousands to watch the changing of the guard outside Buckingham Palace at 11.30am every day in the summer and every other day in the winter. The Guard comprises two detachments, one each for Buckingham Palace and St James's Palace, under the command of the Captain of The Queen's Guard. Contrary to popular belief they are not purely ceremonial and are fully operational soldiers. The Ministry of Defence said they would not comment on 'a young man falling over while doing his job'. The embarrassed guard hastily scrambled to his feet following the unfortunate tumble at the palace . The incident took place in front of hundreds of tourists who were watching the Changing of the Guard .
Whitaker on way out . James Whitaker's brief reign as the ECB’s head of selectors looks set to end when the new director of cricket is announced. It is expected the responsibilities of the chosen appointment will include being in overall charge of selection, leading to the end of Whitaker’s stint. His position has looked untenable in any case since Paul Downton was axed as managing director of England cricket. One county displeased by the Test squad that Whitaker and his panel picked for the current tour of the West Indies are Yorkshire. The champions are furious that of their six players in the Caribbean, four — Adam Lyth, Adil Rashid, Liam Plunkett and Jonny Bairstow — have been on the sidelines throughout the Test series. England Cricket Board national selector James Whitaker looks set to finish his brief reign in the role . Whitaker's (centre) stint will come to an end when the new director of cricket is appointed . Meanwhile, Yorkshire coach Jason Gillespie is the subject of renewed bids from South Australia, having turned down their first approach. Though born in Sydney, Gillespie played his entire domestic career Down Under for South Australia. Sam Allardyce's future as manager of West Ham is subject to much speculation at a time when an extraordinary letter sent by lawyers acting for Blackburn Rovers owners Venky’s to football agency Kentaro’s legal representatives is still doing the rounds. The letter, from December 22, 2011, makes numerous disputed claims about Kentaro’s involvement in Blackburn after Venky’s bought the club the previous year. Among other things, it alleges that it was Kentaro who persuaded the new Indian owners to sack Allardyce and replace him with Steve Kean, a client of Kentaro’s agency partners SEM. Sam Allardyce's future as West Ham boss is in doubt at the same time as a letter regarding the end of his tenure at Blackburn Rovers does the rounds . Kentaro are now in administration in the UK. But SEM say it was entirely Venky’s decision to dispense with Allardyce as they wanted ‘good entertaining football’, and that Kean negotiated his own contract to become caretaker manager. FA Cup, the oldest knockout football competition in the world, is set to be rebranded as the Emirates FA Cup in a new £30million sponsorship deal . In a move that will upset traditionalists, the FA are understood to have secured a three-year contract with Emirates Airlines. The deal, due to be rubber-stamped by the FA board on Thursday, is believed to be worth at least £10million a year — but comes at a cost for lovers of the 144-year-old competition. Arsenal won last season's FA Cup competition, which will be rebranded the Emirates FA Cup . Renaming it the Emirates FA Cup is a lot closer to title sponsorship than the previous ‘in association with Budweiser’ agreement, which was worth £9m annually. But the FA, after a highly embarrassing season without any Cup backer that has put huge pressure on their commercial department, needed to offer more to attract a significant sponsor to the table. The hunt proved hugely difficult even after the FA revamped their sponsorship team to bring in expertise honed at Manchester United. And it needed a bit of luck to attract Emirates Airlines, who have a massive sports sponsorship portfolio across the world that includes Arsenal’s stadium and kit. Emirates have big money to spend after deciding last November not to renew their £30m-a-year FIFA sponsorship for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. The allegations of corruption surrounding those tournaments are said to have been a consideration. And Emirates are no longer involved, either, in the tender for a Champions League airline backer, allowing the FA to offer a major football sponsorship alternative. Aston Villa will face the holders Arsenal in this season's final at Wembley Stadium . Dubai-based Emirates have their arch Abu Dhabi airline rivals Etihad as Manchester City’s kit and stadium sponsors. But City foresee no problems with an Emirates FA Cup. The deal with Emirates will also allow for a further six subsidiary sponsors for the competition — with Budweiser, Nike and William Hill already signed up. And the ambition is for the whole FA Cup sponsorship portfolio to be worth £20m by 2018. The Emirates deal, likely to be officially announced nearer to the FA Cup final on May 30, is also well-timed for the FA’s commercial department, with the new chief executive Martin Glenn arriving at Wembley next month. Tickets for the all-French European Rugby Champions Cup final between Toulon and Clermont Auvergne at Twickenham on Saturday are selling so poorly that England Rugby Supporters Club members have been offered the chance to buy two seats for the price of one. Tickets for Saturday's European Rugby Champions Cup final at Twickenham aren't selling well . It has emerged that the final flashpoint in the breakdown of relations between the RFU hierarchy and Debbie Jevans, who quit as CEO of England Rugby 2015, was over a Twickenham hospitality box for the World Cup. Jevans wanted control over the guest list, while the RFU didn’t want it full of her friends and contacts. It is not clear if ER2015 will have such a facility during the tournament. Their spokeswoman refused to comment. ER2015 insist Jevans’s exit will not affect the smooth running of the World Cup. Yet the Northampton v Saracens game in Milton Keynes last Saturday, run as a test event for the tournament, has presented the organisers with significant traffic issues to resolve.

A mother was left in shock after her four-year-old daughter discovered a four-foot snake in the bath - just a week after moving into the house. Michelle Woods, from Norton in Teesside, was told by her daughter Elisha Mann that 'something was moving' in the bath. And when the pair walked into the bathroom to check what was there, that's when they came face to face with the reptile. The four-foot red and orange corn snake, which Michelle Woods discovered slithering around in the bathroom of her new home. She believes it may belong to the property's previous tenant . Mrs Woods, a full-time mother, said: 'I thought she was joking, but Elisha made me go and have a look, so I went and checked the bin and nothing was there. 'But then I looked up and I was face-to-face with a snake. I nearly jumped out of my skin and slammed the door shut. 'I even made sure our cat Smotker was locked downstairs in case it tried to attack it. I had no idea at the time if it was dangerous or not.' Panicking, Ms Woods said she called the RSPCA, who were unable to help - so in desperation, posted an appeal on Facebook. Within an hour, a local woman who keeps snakes had recognised her plight and identified the reptile as a corn snake, a non-venomous species normally kept as a pet. The woman then came to the house and took away the snake so Ms Woods and Elisha could get a good night's sleep. Ms Woods, 44, added: 'It was a great response. Obviously, they thought I was just joking at first but when I sent them a picture they posted it up online and I got some help straight away. Michelle Woods with her daughter Elisha Mann, who first spotted the snake in the bath before alerting her mother . It is not clear how the snake ended up in the bathroom, but Ms Woods believes that the previous tenant may have kept snakes as pets and lost the red and orange reptile while moving. She explained: 'We couldn't think of another way it could have got into the house, but goodness knows where it had been for the week we lived there before he spotted it. 'I was petrified at first and I was a bit nervoud about using the bathroom for the rest of the night. 'But luckily we haven't found anything else yet!' But the encounter didn't faze four-year-old Elisha, who said: 'When I saw the snake it was really still. 'I wasn't scared at all. I knew not to touch it. I'm looking forward to telling me friends about it at school.'
Scotland youth international Jack Cosgrove has agreed to join Edinburgh next season. The 20-year-old Worcester Warriors prop, capped nine times for the Dark Blues Under 20s side, has penned a two-year deal with Alan Solomons' side which ties him to the Murrayfield outfit until May 2017. He said: 'I'm over the moon to be coming north. With the club being in a European Cup Final, they're really showing they've got quality players and everyone is speaking very highly of Edinburgh. Scotland youth international Jack Cosgrove has agreed to join Edinburgh next season on a two-year deal . The 20-year-old Worcester Warriors prop has been capped nine times for the Dark Blues Under 20s side .

Condemned Bali Nine member Myuran Sukumaran has requested to spend his last days before his execution painting for as long as possible. His final request comes as images from Nusakambangan showed a haunting self portrait painted by Sukumaran in his cell, depicting the artist shot through the heart. His brother, Chinthu Sukumaran has pleaded with the Indonesian president to call off the firing squad while Sukumaran's lawyer was pictured removing the morbid paintings from the death row inmate's cell. Sukumaran's fellow death row inmate, Andrew Chan, has requested to spend his last hours in church with his family. Scroll down for video . Bali Nine member Myuran Sukumaran has requested to spend his final days painting. He painted this self-portrait, showing a bullet through his heart . The painting is a self-portrait of Sukumaran with a bullet hole through his heart . It comes after it was confirmed that Australians Andrew Chan and Sukumaran will be executed just after the stroke of midnight on Wednesday (3am AEST). The date - April 29 - became official when a local funeral director in Cilacap, the nearest port to Nusakambangan, or Death Island, was instructed to inscribe the names of those to be shot by firing squad and the date of their deaths. Sukumaran only began painting when he was arrested and sent to prison in 2005. His skill and love for his art grew as he was mentored by well-known Australian artist Ben Quilty - who has also led the charge in the mercy campaign to save the pair's lives. Andrew Chan (left) and Myuran Sukumaran (right) have both been condemned to death on just past the stroke of midnight on Wednesday . Julian McMahon (pictured) the lawyer for the Bali Nine pair, removed the morbid paintings from Sukumaran's cell . McMahon looked downcast as he carried the paintings back from Death Island . Painting has proven a great sense of solace for Sukumaran during his time in jail and has even run art classes for fellow inmates as part of the drug rehabilitation program that he set up with Chan. The talented artist's birthday in early April was marked in London where his cousin organised an exhibition of his paintings at the Amnesty International headquarters. The Bali Nine pair's lawyer Julian McMahon took four disturbing self portrait from Sukumaran's cell on Sunday, depicting the artist shot through the heart. The paintings were signed: 'Our new prison. A Bad Sleep Last Night', 'A strange day' and '72hrs Just Started'. Michael Chan (right), the brother of Andrew Chan and Chinthu Sukumaran (left), the brother of Myuran Sukumaran have pleaded once again for their clemency . Bali 9 duo Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran have been given notice of their execution, and could be killed by firing squad as early as Tuesday . A smiling Djoko Hariutomo, the police commissioner of the Balinese capital of Denpasar, poses for a photo with his hand on the shoulder of condemned prisoner Andrew Chan on a plane taking him to 'Death Island' They were dated April 24 and April 25. Chan and Sukumaran both refused to sign their execution warrants during official proceedings on Saturday, saying they believed it would be unjust to kill them. Chan and Sukumaran, convicted in 2005 for their role in a plot to smuggle 8.3kg of heroin from Bali to Australia, were given the official 72 hours notice on Saturday. 'He's found peace with what may happen but he and we all feel that this is a grave injustice and it did not have to be this way and it still doesn't have to be this way,' Chinthu Sukumaran told reporters, after spending a couple of hours with his brother. Surrounded by armed police officers officers and on the road of no return, 33-year-old Australia Myuran Sukumaran looks up at Bali police commissioner Djoko Hariutomo who posed with the two condemned Australians before they were transported to Nusakambangan island . It has been confirmed that the two men will be executed just past midnight on Wednesday . His mother Raji and sister Brintha also visited on Sunday, making the sad journey with Chan's mother Helen, brother Michael and fiancée Feby Herewila and other friends. Chinthu Sukumaran said they asked Joko Widodo to show the same mercy he'd asked for his own citizens on death row overseas. 'Please, please show mercy,' he said. 'There are nine people with families that love them. Sukumaran painted the portraits in the hours before he and Andrew Chan were given execution notices . 'That's mothers, fathers, sons, daughters, brothers and sisters. 'We ask the president to please use his powers to intervene and save their lives.' Mr Chan said his brother's only wish would be to go to church with his family in his last days. 'The two boys are still holding up pretty well considering they feel this is injust (unjust) to what has happened over the last ten years with their whole case,' he said. 'Somewhere in the legal system for Indonesia there's got to be mercy and the president needs to show that now. 'He's the only one that can stop it and it's not too late to do so.' It's reported only nine of the 10 prisoners Indonesia had readied for execution will face the firing squad, with Frenchman Serge Atlaoui granted a reprieve. Mr Atlaoui apparently won a reprieve based on an administrative matter. Mr McMahon carried Sukumaran's self-portraits away after showing them to reporters . The back of Sukumaran's morbid paintings read: 'self portrait' 72hrs just started' The paintings were signed by Sukumaran and dated . Sukumaran and Chan have been granted more time with family in their final days and will see them again on Monday. Lawyers are pleading with Jakarta to respect legal proceedings that several are still pursuing, while international pressure for mercy also grows. France has pledged to work with Australia to halt the executions, with Prime Minister Tony Abbott set to meet Francois Hollande on Monday. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has been seeking urgent talks with her Indonesian counterpart since Friday. Chan and Sukumaran's lawyers have lodged a challenge with the constitutional court but the attorney-general doesn't acknowledge it, arguing the pair have exhausted their appeals. Andrew Chan has requested to spend his last days in church, while Myuran Sukumaran wishes to paint . Andrew Chan (pictured) has requested to spend his time in church ahead of his execution . The brothers looked sombre as they left the prison on Nusakambangan Island on Sunday . Chinthu Sukumaran said they asked Joko Widodo to show the same mercy he'd asked for his own citizens on death row overseas. Sukumaran began painting when he was in Kerobokan Prison in Bali . But his office is yet to respond to moves by lawyers for Filipina Mary Jane Veloso, who filed a second request for a judicial review late on Friday. Indonesia Zainal Abidin has an appeal before the courts due to be decided on Monday, but has been moved in preparation of execution as if the result is pre-determined. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon has added his voice to global calls for Indonesia to halt its execution plans. 'The Secretary General urges President Joko Widodo to urgently consider declaring a moratorium on capital punishment in Indonesia, with a view toward abolition,' a spokesman for Ban said.

Real Sociedad remain hopeful over a deal for Burnley striker Danny Ings. Liverpool, Manchester City and Manchester United have all shown interest in the England Under 21 international but have yet to sign him up as they consider other options also. Ings has interest from Borussia Monchengladbach among others but Sociedad have remained constant from the start. Real Sociedad are still hopeful of singing Burnley striker Danny Ings when his contract expires in the summer . Michel Vorm saves from Ings as the Burnley forward passes up a great chance to give his side the lead against Tottenham on Sunday . England Under 21 international Ings chats with Harry Kane after the final whistle at Turf Moor . The 23-year-old knows he can play regularly there, will be watched with interest by England coach Roy Hodgson and will get the money he wants. Sociedad manager David Moyes has taken the club into the top half of La Liga and intends to build on that in the summer and Ings could prove a key acquisition. Ings' contract at Burnley expires in the summer and is unlikely to sign another one regardless of their ability to survive relegation this season. Should Ings move to another Premier League club Burnley would be due a sizeable compensation fee because of his age, but that fee would be nominal if the striker moved abroad.
A New York City bus driver is facing possible termination after video emerged of him looking at papers and driving with his wrists and forearms. A woman who boarded the driver's bus in Ozone Park, Queens, recorded the unidentified driver marking a set of papers with a highlighter and  looking away from the road. She was 'shocked' that the driver's behavior continued the entire ten minutes she was on the bus, in which all the seats were full. A New York City bus driver running a route in Queens is facing possible termination after an unidentified commuter recorded him driving with papers in his hand . The driver was seen with both hands on a piece of paper, believed to be a timetable for his route replacing the closed section of a subway, and driving the bus with his wrists and forearms . The commuter who captured the distracted driving on a bus with only standing room said that the behavior occurred the entire time she was travelling . 'He jeopardized the lives of everyone on that bus and anyone on the street,' the commuter said. The papers in his hand were likely timetables used to make sure he was stopping at all the correct junctures on Saturday evening,  the New York Post reported, citing a transit source. The bus was being used to replace part of a subway line closed for maintenance during the weekend. New York's Metro Transportation Authority, which runs the city's buses, said that 'bus operators are expected to have their full attention on safe operations at all times'. The driver has been taken out of passenger service while the agency investigates, and could face possible penalties including termination or retraining depending on his work history, according to a New York Post source. New York City adopted new laws last year as part of an effort to eliminate traffic accidents, such as the February 2014 crash between an city bus and a truck that careened into a building on 7th Avenue . This weekend's video comes as New York City has targeted speeding and reckless motorists in a bid to eliminate traffic deaths . A  law pushed into law by Mayor Bill DeBlasio last August has increased penalties on drivers, including MTA employees, who hit pedestrians after failing to yield. Bus drivers have said they are under attack by the new regulations, and that accidents happen even when drivers are doing their jobs properly. At least nine pedestrians were killed by transportation authority buses last year, according to the New York Times.
A man has been arrested and bailed following the 'suspicious' death of a woman found floating in the water at a boat club - just hours after a children's Easter Egg hunt took place in the grounds. The victim, who has not been formally identified but is thought to be in her 60s, was discovered at Derby Motor Boat Club in Sawley, Leicestershire, on Sunday night. A 65-year-old man was arrested in connection with her death before being released on police bail. The woman's body was found at Derby Motor Boat Club in Sawley on the River Trent (pictured) The club's Rear Commodore, Steve Bilbie, said: 'We are very upset, but we can't say anything else' The area was cordoned off for forensic examination and detectives say the investigation is in its 'early stages'. A spokesman for Leicestershire Police said a post-mortem examination had failed to establish a cause of death and that results of further tests would not be known 'for some time'. Detective Chief Inspector Mick Graham, who is leading the investigation, said: 'At this stage we're treating the incident as a suspicious death. 'Officers will be carrying out inquiries locally to locate potential witnesses to any activity around the marina yesterday evening. Police at the scene today - officers are continuing to investigate the woman's 'suspicious' death . A 65-year-old man has been arrested and released on bail in relation to the woman's death . 'If you have any information which you believe may be able to assist us then please get in touch.' The woman's body was discovered at around 10.21pm on Sunday in the marina in Warren Lane. The Derby Motor Boat club, which has an annual fee of £750, was founded in 1938 by a group of local businessmen. Its current Rear Commodore, Steve Bilbie, said: 'We are very upset, but we can't say anything else as there is an ongoing investigation.' A description of the club on its website reads: 'We are situated on the River Trent at Sawley close to the junctions of the Trent with the River Soar, the Erewash Canal and the Trent.' The boat club has space for 130 boats on individual moorings, which stretch around a third of a mile along the bank of the canal. Each has access to water and electricity. The club also has a headquarters, based in a portable building, children's play area, toilet and shower block. Leicestershire Police (headquarters pictured) said a post-mortem failed to establish a cause of death and results of further tests would not be known 'for some time'. The woman has not been formally identified . Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.
A former special education high school teacher who admitted to having sex with five underage male students has been sentenced to three years in state prison. Summer Michelle Hansen, 32, of California entered a guilty plea in February to 16 felony counts related to the sex acts which included seven counts of oral copulation of a minor, six counts of statutory rape and three counts of distributing pornographic material to a child, according to NBC. The mother of three was told during the sentencing on Friday that she must also register as a sex offender for life. Parents of the victims were upset that Hansen's plea agreement was approved, which was made directly to Riverside County Superior Court Judge Becky Dugan. If she had been convicted at trial, Hansen would have faced 13 years in prison. Scroll down for video . Summer Michelle Hansen (above in court during her sentencing on Friday), 32, was sentenced on Friday to three years in state prison and must also register as a sex offender for life . Parents of the victims were disappointed that the judge approved Hansen's plea agreement, as she could have faced 13 years in prison if convicted at trial . Hansen entered a guilty plea in February to the 16 felony counts related to sex acts with her five male students . Judge  Dugan said she took into consideration factors such as the former teacher's admittance of guilt and lack of prior criminal history when deciding on an appropriate sentence. In court on Friday, the judge told Hansen: 'You're a mother yourself. It's beyond me to understand your behavior.' Deputy District Attorney Kimberly Williams said that her office opposed the length of the sentence proposed by the judge but that she was happy to see Hansen take responsibility for her actions, according to the Press Enterprise. Hansen made an emotional plea to the victims' families while in court saying she prayed for them every night and that she was 'heartbroken', according to KTLA. 'I'm not a monster. I made bad choices in life and for that I'm truly, truly sorry,' Hansen said through tears. The ex-teacher came under investigation two years ago after a former student at Centennial High School came forward to say he had sex with Hansen, and she was arrested in June 2013. Prosecutors said the crimes took place in her classroom, a school utility room, her car and at one victim's home between May 2012 and 2013, according to KTLA. It is not believed that the students were taught by her at the time but all were under the age of 18. Hansen, (left and right) was a special education instructor at Centennial High School. She was officially terminated on Friday by the Corona-Norco Unified School District . In court Hansen made an emotional plea to the victims' parents and said: 'I'm not a monster. I made bad choices in life and for that I'm truly, truly sorry' Court documents revealed that the sex related acts included Hansen having oral sex with a student who was in her classroom for Saturday school, sending students texts with pictures of herself naked, and having sex with two students while on campus, according to NBC. On Friday, one of the victim's mother referred to Hansen as a 'predator' in court and said she 'stalked my child in the sanctuary of a school'. The mother also said she was disappointed in the judicial system that gave Hansen a 'ridiculously low offer'. One of the victims' mothers said she was disappointed with the 'ridiculously low offer' given during the sentencing to Hansen (above pictured in court last May) Hansen was under investigation after a student came forward and said he had sex with her. She was arrested in June 2013 and prosecutors said the crimes occurred between 2012 and 2013 . Another parent said the three-year sentence was 'a slap in the face' for the victims. Hansen was  was placed on administrative leave following her arrest while officials tried to determine how many students she had sex with, and she was officially terminated on Friday by the Corona-Norco Unified School District. Parents at the school were stunned by the arrest two years ago. 'It surprises me that any 31-year-old . adult, married woman is having sex with a child, teacher or otherwise,' said parent Angela Thompson at the time. Staff at Centennial High School (pictured) in Corona notified police to Hansen's alleged inappropriate relationships .
For most couples, a  peck on the lips is a quick way to show affection. But for Kerrie Armitage, a kiss from husband Peter can trigger agonising hives. The mother-of-three, from Leeds, suffers from the ultra-rare condition aquagenic urticaria – an allergy to water. She was diagnosed two years ago after her skin erupted in agonising blisters when she got caught in a rain storm. Now the 28-year-old has had to stop kissing her husband of four years, because the saliva on his lips can trigger a painful flare-up. Kerrie Armitage, from Leeds, suffers from the ultra-rare condition aquagenic urticaria – an allergy to water. She claims a kiss from her husband Peter (right) can trigger a painful flare-up, due to contact with his saliva . She said: 'Because Peter's lips are wet, the saliva can make me react. He's got to make sure his lips are dry before he gave me a kiss. 'It's not every time - I can do the same thing time and time again and not react, but then I'll do it once more and get a flare-up.' Her condition means that external exposure to water is the main problem, rather than drinking liquid. The situation has become so bad that hugging her children can trigger an episode, as their body heat makes her sweat - and she has trained herself not to cry. However, she added an allergic reaction tended to depend on the circumstances. 'For example, if Peter was to give me a kiss on a hot day when I'm flushed, I'd probably flare up, but maybe not if I was in a cool environment,' she said. 'It can be frustrating but he's really supportive. 'After years together, it's become normal. You learn how to get used it. But it can be bothersome.' Mrs Armitage now faces a daiily battle to protect her skin from agonising flare-ups - and has also been forced to give up her job as a cleaner because she cannot not touch water. Even hugging her children Katie, nine, Emily, two and four-year-old step-daughter Savannah,  can become a nightmare as their body heat can trigger a reaction. 'It affects every aspect of my day to day life,' she said. 'I have to choose between doing the washing up and bathing my kids. My hands can't take them both – it's too painful.' She added: 'When I've got my children sat on me giving me a cuddle their body heat can cause me to sweat and have a reaction. Her condition has become so bad that her hugging her children can trigger an episode, as their body heat makes her sweat - and bathing them can be problematic . 'Even tears can trigger the hives. I've had to train myself not to cry. 'I've learned not to get too angry or frustrated, as this can make my body flush and cause me to sweat, which can be very painful.' Due to her condition, Mrs Armitage must ensure she bathes in under 10 minutes to try and minimise the allergic reaction. 'I've found the closer the water is to body temperature the faster I react, so I have really hot baths to try lessen the reaction,'she siad. 'I also  don't drink cold water - it feels quite sharp at the back of my throat - so I stick to coffee.' Mrs Armitage, who has to keep antihistamines and an EpiPen with her at all times, also suffers from exercise-induced anaphylaxis. Previously a size eight, with a keen interest in fitness, the exercise allergy combined with side effects of her medication have seen her expand to a size 14. She discovered this second allergy just months after her urticaria diagnosis after playing on a Nintendo Wii Fit game at home. 'It was completely out of the blue,' she said. 'I couldn't breathe, I was on the floor struggling to get air into my lungs. 'Thankfully, I stopped the exercising straight away and my breathing slowed, but I was left feeling quite sick for a few days afterwards.' The mother-of-two suffers from the ultra-rare condition aquagenic urticaria – an allergy to water. She was diagnosed two years ago after her skin erupted in agonising blisters when she got caught in a rain storm. Swellings known as weals appear between 15 minutes and two hours after exposure to water . She can now tell when an episode may strike - and knows she must stop whatever she's doing when she feels the earning signs. 'I can't articulate what's happening at the time - it all becomes quite foggy in my head,' she said. On another occasion, Mrs Armitage was forced to sit on the floor, gasping for breath in the middle of Leeds' White Rose shopping centre after a reaction was triggered by simply walking up a flight of stairs. In a vicious cycle, the anaphylactic reaction causes her to sweat which, in turn, triggers her water allergy. She said: 'The two worst episodes I've had have been after no more than five minutes – the equivalent to a warm up. Urticaria, also known as hives or nettle rash, is a condition in which short-lived swellings occur anywhere on the body. These swellings (weals) may be pale, pink, or red, of different sizes and shape and itchy. As the raised weals flatten, they leave red marks that disappear usually in a day. New weals may then appear in other areas . The itchy reaction is caused by the release of histamine in response to a number of different triggers. Some form of it affects 20 per cent of people at some point. However, aquagenic urticaria - triggered by water of any temperature - is extremely rare. The weals appear between 15 minutes and two hours after exposure to water. In more severe cases drinking water can cause minor swelling in the throat. There is no known cure. Symptoms can be lessened by reducing exposure - such as taking quick showers, applying petroleum jelly to the skin as well as taking anti-histamines. 'I've had to rule out exercise completely now, it's just too much of a worry.' Mrs Armitage, who has spoken out as part of Allergy Awareness Week, has also had to teach eldest daughter Katie how to administer an EpiPen injection. Now, she faces a daily checklist to ensure she's done everything she can to avoid reactions. 'Before leaving the house I have to ask myself if I can get to the bus stop or if it's too far and likely to trigger my reactions,' she said. 'I have to check if it's going to rain and make sure I have back-up clothing in case I get too hot or too cold. 'My social life has gone to pot. 'Before, I could just say, "of course I'll come out' but now, it's, "where are we going? What's the weather? Can I park somewhere close so I don't have to walk and risk my anaphylaxis triggering?"' 'There are all these stupid little things I have to consider.' Amena Warner, nurse advisor at Allergy UK said: 'Urticaria is also known as nettle rash or hives. 'It is a red raised itchy rash and is very common, affecting one person in five at some point in their life. 'In most people, it settles quickly and is no more than a mild inconvenience, but in some people it can be severe and long lasting. 'A very rare form of urticaria is that which is triggered by water, which is called aquagenic urticaria, the red raised itchy rash comes up on contact with water. 'Treatment can help the symptoms and the person should receive specialist information from an allergist/immunologist.' This week is Allergy Awareness Week.

Dunkin Donuts unveiled a new spring menu earlier this week, prompting a flurry of excitement from the food chain's biggest fans - and a series of serious warnings from health experts about the calorie-laden food options, some of which contain more than half of an adult's recommended daily intake of salt. The new menu contains five new food options - two 340-calorie cheesecake-filled donuts, one 380-calorie loaded bagel, one 640-calorie chicken-filled pretzel bun and a 'low fat' 210-calorie steak and cheese wrap. 'This new menu is laden with calories and fat. Many of these calories are considered "empty calories" meaning that they have little or no nutritional value,' cardiologist Dr Kevin Campbell told Daily Mail Online. Warnings: Dunkin Donuts' new spring menu features the 640-calorie Pretzel Roll Chicken Sandwich which contains 68 per cent of your daily allowance of salt . Sweet tooth? The new menu also features two new flavors of the chain's Cheesecake Square Donuts, which each contain upwards of 340 calories . Obesity and obesity-related illness has become epidemic; in the US alone obesity and obesity-related illness accounts for a $150 billion dollars of healthcare expenditures annually . 'As adults we must set good examples for our children because they pattern our behavior we must avoid eating food such as these presented on the new menu at Dunkin' Donuts.' Indeed, the food chain's new Pretzel Roll Chicken Sandwich - which is described on the Dunkin Donuts website as containing 'delicious breaded chicken, cheddar cheese, bacon and honey mustard' which are all  'served on an oven-toasted pretzel bun' - contains a whopping 640 calories, almost a third of your recommended daily intake. Additionally, the sandwich contains 1,560mg of sale, which is equal to 68 per cent of the daily recommended intake of 2,300mg. The roll also contains 25g of fat - 38 per cent of your daily intake. And when paired with one of Dunkin Donuts' new ice cream-inspired coffee flavors - Rocky Road Swirl, Butter Pecan Swirl, or Cookie Dough Swirl - customers are adding a minimum of 200 odd calories to their meal, if they opt for whole milk and sugar in their coffee. Another option listed on the new menu is the Southwest Supreme Bagel, which is stuffed with cheese, corn, black beans, peppers, tomatoes, onions and spices and contains 380 calories and 890mg of salt - which is 37 per cent of the recommended intake. Something savory: The Southwest Supreme Bagel contains 380 calories and 890mg of salt . Healthy? The 210-calorie Snack N’ Go Steak Wrap is intended to be a low-calorie alternative to the other menu options, however it still contains 25 per cent of your daily saturated fat intake . Healthier than the pretzel roll, yes, but still not the most nutritious treat around. Indeed, the only 'healthy' option offered on the new menu is a small Snack N’ Go Steak Wrap, a 210-calorie snack that contains 'our delicious angus steak, a slice of cheddar cheese and honey mustard sauce, wrapped in a warm tortilla'. But while this tasty treat is being marketed as a healthier, low-calorie option, it still contains five grams of saturated fats, which is the equivalent of 25 per cent of your recommended daily intake. Last, but not least, the menu also contains two new varieties of Dunkin Donuts' signature Cheesecake Square Donut, which is essentially a sugary pastry stuffed with cheesecake filling, this time in Oreo and raspberry flavors. And while the nutritional information for these individual sweet treats has not yet been made available on the Dunkin website, the standard Cheesecake Square Donut contains 340 calories and eight grams of saturated fats - 40 per cent of your daily allowance. Unsurprisingly, the chain's unhealthy menu options have prompted some health-conscious Twitter users to voice their concerns over the calorie-laden choices. 'If Dunkin Donuts replaced their white flour with organic whole wheat and sugar with stevia, they would probably still be unhealthy,' one man wrote, while one woman added: 'These Dunkin Donuts options have to be the most unhealthy things ever.'
A former soldier has been reunited with his long-lost son after 25 years - after he spotted his Facebook page appealing for help finding his father. The post by Lewis Helget, 27, appeared on Darren Goddard's timeline when he logged into the social networking site with the intention of deleting his account. A quarter of a century earlier, the 48-year-old had made the heartbreaking decision to leave behind his 18-month-old son, who he thought he would never see again. Finally reunited: Darren Goddard (right) finally met his son Lewis Helget, 27, last month after 25 years apart . Mr Goddard 'cried himself to sleep' when he parted ways with Lewis in 1989 after his marriage broke down following a horrific car accident. Just six years earlier, he had moved to Germany to pursue a career in the Army and met Lewis' mother Aggi, who he married two years later. Following his return to the UK from Germany, where he had been based as a soldier, he endured a 'real struggle' to move on with his life. He eventually came to terms with the fact he would never see his son again. Around three years ago, Mr Goddard's daughter Cally, 15, created a Facebook page for him. The former soldier never used the account and was about to delete it when Lewis' appeal turned up on his newsfeed. Happy ending: Former soldier Mr Goddard says his life is now 'complete' after seeing his 27-year-old son . Mr Goddard, of Basingstoke, Hants, said: 'Cally set me up with a Facebook account but I had no clue how to use it. 'I opened up my Facebook to shut it down and get rid of it and then Lewis was there and it said he had been looking for his father for four years. 'When I left the Army and came over here, I cried myself to sleep for two years. I knew his mum was a good mother and had lots of family so I was happy in the knowledge of that. 'But it still took me two years to get over the fact I was never going to see him again.' Lewis, who lives in Emsdetten in north west Germany, was finally reunited with his father in March. Mr Goddard made the first contact and the pair now speak to each other every day via Skype. They met at Stansted Airport last month as Lewis flew to the UK from Germany to attend his grandfather Ron's funeral - a man he never met. They spent a week together before Lewis returned to Germany on March 25 - and Mr Goddard says his life is now 'complete'. Troubled past: Mr Goddard's marriage to Lewis' mother ended after he was involved in a serious car accident which ended his career as a solider and led to him getting depression and leaving Germany . Describing how his marriage to Lewis' mother ended, the father-of-two spoke of the terrible injuries he suffered in a car accident. Following a year of agony, he was taken to a hospital near his Army base in Munster, Germany, to have an operation to remove a smashed disk in his back in 1988. It soon became clear he would not be able to carry out his Army duties and his career came to an abrupt end. Mr Goddard then began suffering from depression - which led to the breakdown of his marriage to Aggi. He added: 'Lewis has always been in my heart and I have never stopped thinking about him. 'When we met you wouldn't believe we have spent any time apart and we had our arms around each other and hugged. 'It has been so lovely and we have had the most fantastic week. He is a lovely man and is quite a bit like me.' Lewis said: 'It was very important for me to know my dad so that is why I came to England to meet him.'
The Conservatives have opened up a four-point lead over Labour with millions of voters yet to make up their minds about how to vote in the tightest election race since 1992. An exclusive poll by ComRes for the Daily Mail and ITV News shows that David Cameron’s party, on 36 per cent of the vote, has moved ahead in the last fortnight as Labour, the Liberal Democrats and Ukip have all slipped. The Tory vote share equals their highest since March 2012. Labour is on 32 per cent, Ukip on ten per cent and the Liberal Democrats on eight per cent, with the Greens on five per cent. Scroll down for video . David Cameron's (left) Conservative party has opened up a four-point lead over Ed Miliband's (right) Labour with 36 per cent of the vote compared to 32 per cent, a new ComRes poll reveals with just two weeks to go . Crucially, the poll suggests that with less than a fortnight to go, there is all to play for – with a startling one in five of those who say they are likely to vote still not sure which party they will back. The main parties are evenly split when voters are asked who they would consider backing on May 7, with 48 per cent saying Labour and 47 per cent Conservative. Some 66 per cent say they would never countenance voting Ukip, with 29 per cent saying they would. The poll confirms catastrophic drop in support for the Lib Dems demonstrated in the attitudes of its former voters. Two in five – 41 per cent -- of 2010 Lib Dem voters say that they would not consider voting for the party this year. However, 25 per cent of both Conservative and Labour voters say that they would consider voting Lib Dem, suggesting that the party still has some hope of winning over voters on either side of the political spectrum. Men are slightly more inclined to consider voting for the Conservatives than women – 50 per cent compared to 43 per cent. The reverse is true for the Lib Dems – 25 per cent of men compared to 31 per cent of women, while both genders are equally likely to consider voting Labour, with 48 per cent each. Voters appear relatively relaxed about the rise of smaller parties. Some 75 per cent say it is good to have parties other than the big two in government. Nick Clegg's (left) Liberal Democrats have an eight per cent share of the vote, will Nigel Farage's (right) Ukip has ten per cent. The poll suggests that the Green party has five per cent of the vote ahead of the election . More than half of British adults – 57 per cent -- disagree that a hung parliament places too much power in the hands of smaller parties, and seven in ten – 70 per cent -- disagree that having smaller parties in government is undemocratic. However, the poll shows that Conservative voters are significantly less positive about the increase in support for smaller parties. Almost half of them – 46 per cent – believe that another hung parliament would give them too much sway. ComRes said the poll showed the Tories had ‘reinforced their lead’, with Labour yet to be ahead in any telephone survey by the pollster this year. Despite this, the Tories are still ‘unsure of winning a majority of seats in the Commons’, it added. Tom Mludzinski, head of political polling at ComRes, said: ‘Our latest poll continues the trend we’ve seen all year, with the Conservatives just, but consistently, ahead of Labour. Despite this lead, both parties have very similar proportions of the electorate willing to consider voting for them. ‘With just two weeks left and the margin so fine, both Labour and the Conservatives will be exerting most of their efforts on moving people from these pools of potential support into polling booths across the country to make their votes count.’ A more detailed ComRes analysis of undecided voters, involving 1,500 people, will lift Tory spirits. It found that they trust that the Conservatives will be better than Labour at promoting economic growth by a wide margin of 42 per cent to 15 per cent. Mr Cameron is the leader most undecided voters want to see running the country, backed by 28 per cent, ahead of Ed Miliband, with 16 per cent. And 42 per cent say Mr Cameron is strong, compared to only 11 per cent who say the same of the Labour leader. Some 42 per cent of undecided voters regard him as a good leader, compared to only 14 per cent who say the same of Mr Miliband. To the alarm of Labour strategists, another pollster also suggested the party’s support is slipping and the Tories have taken a four-point lead. A Survation poll for the Mirror put the Conservatives up two on last week, with 33 per cent, Labour down six on 29 per cent, Ukip on 18 per cent and the Lib Dems on ten per cent.
The mother-of-five who was arrested for allegedly throwing her 16-year-old daughter a drunken party  where they played naked Twister together has admitted to turning towards alcohol during her divorce from her veteran husband. Rachel Lehnardt, 35, had been a life-long follower of the Mormon church and had never touched a drop of alcohol before her split from her husband James, who was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder when he returned from Iraq, her lawyer said in a statement on Thursday. But following their divorce last year, she began drinking and ultimately broke away from the church, where she had once been a Sunday school teacher, the lawyer said. Her alcohol abuse culminated in the startling incident in which she allegedly allowed her daughter and her friends to drink alcohol and smoke marijuana in front of her at their Evans, Georgia home. Scroll down for video . Struggles: Rachel Lynn Lehnardt, 35, is pictured walking outside her Georgia home on Wednesday, several days after she was arrested for allegedly throwing a drunken party for her teenage daughter . She had already been drunk when her 16-year-old daughter returned with her friends, according to her lawyer, Shawn Hammond. According to authorities, Lehnardt and the teenagers then played naked Twister - although Lehnardt left halfway through the game to have sex with an 18-year-old man in the bathroom. When she returned, she brought out sex toys and started to use them on herself in front of the teenagers, Augusta Crime reported. After going to bed, she awoke around 3.30am to find her daughter's 16-year-old boyfriend raping her and immediately threw him off, according to Hammond. The girl later told her mother that she felt guilty because his 10-inch penis was too big for her, so he had to have sex with her mom instead, according to a police report. According to Hammond, Lehnardt woke the next day and realized that her drinking had got out of hand and had led to her being raped by the 16-year-old. Her daughter has now split from the boy. Video from KJBF . Arrested: Lehnardt, pictured in her mug shot, was arrested after she told her AA sponsor about the incident and the sponsor then contacted authorities. Lehnardt said she is working to put it behind her . Split: Her lawyer said Lehnardt, who is a life-long Mormon, turned to drink after divorcing from her husband James Lehnardt, pictured right. He returned from Iraq with PTSD and was later discharged, the lawyer said . After the incident, the children's paternal grandparents found out about the party from the teenage girl and were awarded custody of the five children. Lehnardt was arrested after sharing details of the incident with her Alcoholics Anonymous sponsor, who then went to authorities. As part of the AA's 12 Step program, members write a list of incidents they feel guilty about and confide in their sponsor about the acts (known as the Fifth Step). The person is then required to make amends for past wrongdoings, as long as doing so does not cause harm to others. While there is an expectation of anonymity at meetings, there is no guarantee, and experts recommend exercising caution when detailing crimes, according to The Fix. AA literature simply states that 'anonymity provides protection for all members from identification as alcoholics'. The main 'Understanding Anonymity' booklet does not mention safety from disclosure of a crime and there have been multiple cases of AA members being convicted of crimes, including, murder after confessing to their sponsors. But there has also been some debate over whether the confessions can be used in court. In 2001, a 1995 murder conviction was thrown out after it was ruled that a killer's confession to fellow AA members was constitutionally protected and shouldn't have been used against him. The decision was reached after the judge deemed the 12 Step program had religious undertones, meaning that the members engaged in  religious activity, which is constitutionally protected. Lehnardt's lawyer said she was shocked with what had happened so she researched local Alcoholics Anonymous groups and met with a sponsor, named Heidi, who encouraged Lehnardt to tell her about her divorce, her drinking and the incident that led to her losing her children. Lehnardt also allegedly told the sponsor that she had shown her daughter explicit photos, including of Lehnardt having sex with her current boyfriend, and admitted to being a porn addict. Heidi then went to authorities and told them what the mother-of-five had confessed to doing at the party. Lehnardt's lawyer called Heidi's decision to go to the sheriff's office 'unfortunate'. Lehnardt was arrested last Saturday and charged with two counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor. Hammond, the lawyer, released a statement shared by Augusta Crime on Thursday, saying Lehnardt was 'extremely remorseful' for what had happened. 'Mrs. Lehnardt acknowledges that due to recent alcohol abuse she engaged in several acts of inappropriate conduct,' he said. 'Although, many of the allegations are exaggerated, she is extremely remorseful for what she allowed to occur in her presence and is obtaining professional and pastoral counseling to ensure that this conduct is never repeated.' He denied that she had thrown the party for the teenagers or provided them with drugs, and said she would be fully cooperating with authorities. 'Mrs. Lehnardt has recommitted herself to her faith and her family,' he continued. 'She is hopeful that her children, members of her faith and others will learn from her poor example as to just how easy it is for people to exercise such extremely poor judgment while intoxicated.' He did not comment on the naked Twister, bathroom sex or sex toy allegations, and simply said reports of the incident had been exaggerated. Denial: The mother-of-five said she did not throw the party but did admit to witnessing teenagers smoke marijuana. She also claimed she later awoke to her daughter's teenage boyfriend raping her . Scene: After the party at her home in Evans, Georgia, pictured, she lost custody of her five children . Downcast: Her lawyer said she has been a life-long Mormon who only recently started drinking alcohol . Before the divorce, she had never consumed alcohol, drugs or caffeine, he said. She married her husband, James, in 2000 and they had five children together, now aged between four and 16. James Lehnardt served with an artillery unit in Iraq during one of his deployments where he held the rank of specialist. He was based in Basra, Iraq's second largest city, from July 2009 as part of Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, 17th Fires Brigade, Brigade Aviation Element. The unit, part of the 7th Division, co-ordinated American and Iraqi security force missions in the south of Iraq after British forces left and American troops were deployed there to deal with the Shi'ite militia which took control of the city. He was later based at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, in Tacoma, Washington and more recently, the Augusta-Fort Gordon area of Georgia. But due to his PTSD and anger issues, he was ultimately discharged and is now on VA disability, according to Mrs Lehnardt's lawyer. According to her sponsor, who went to police, she also allegedly used sex toys in front of the teenagers and showed her daughter explicit photos of her having sex with her current boyfriend . Neighborhood: She was already drunk when her daughter and her friends came back to the neighborhood, pictured, because they had been staying at their father's, she said . The couple separated in 2014 and she kept custody of the children. She also returned to work, where she struggled while earning just above minimum wage, he explained. Around this time, she started drinking at the weekends when she didn't have the children and it ultimately got out of hand, leading to the incident at their Evans home, her lawyer said. Following her arrest on Saturday, she posted $3,200 bond and was released from the Columbia County Detention Center. While Lehnardt said she had been raped by the teenage boy, Sheriff's spokesman Captain Steve Morris said there was no evidence of a crime and no charges are pending against the boy. No sexual crime charges have been filed against Lehnardt because 16 is the legal age of consent. This week, she was seen outside her house wearing a hooded jacket and workout clothes, and looking downcast. Her five children, who are aged four, six, eight, 10 and 16, remain with their grandparents.
We’re used to reading about construction projects springing up in China at lightning speed – but things don’t always go according to plan. Sometimes stubborn house owners get in the way, as these incredible images show. These are the ‘nail’ houses in China left standing after their owners refused to give in to property developers vying for their demolition. Homes such as these in China are known as 'dingzihu' or 'nail houses' because they stick out and are difficult to remove, like a stubborn nail. Scroll down for video . Last house standing: A car stops beside a house in the middle of a newly built road in Wenling, Zhejiang provinc . A nail house, the last building in the area, sits in the middle of a road under construction in Nanning, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. According to local media, the owner of the house didn't reach an agreement with the local authority about compensation of the demolition .

One of a kind: A nail house is pictured at a construction site which will be developed into a new apartment zone in Hefei, Anhui province. The banner reads '(We) strongly request the government punishes the criminals. They demolish my house by force. They must return my land' One house in Wenling, Zhejiang province, had a main road built around it when the owner refused to move. An amazing photograph from 2012 shows cars driving around the five-storey property. It remained in the middle of the road for four years. Another image shows a house sitting alone in a crater at the centre of a construction site in Chongqing Municipality, its overgrown garden still intact.

Martina Navratilova's brief stint as coach of 2012 Wimbledon runner-up Agnieszka Radwanska is finished. Navratilova, who won 18 Grand Slam singles titles as a player, and Poland's Radwanska, who is currently ranked No 9, issued statements on Friday to announce the parting. They announced in December that they would work together. Martina Navratilova watches Agnieszka Radwanska in action during this year's Australian Open . Radwanska has struggled this season and was knocked out in the first round in Stuttgart this week . Radwanska is only 13-11 this season, including a first-round loss on Wednesday in a clay-court tournament at Stuttgart, Germany. A statement posted to Radwanska's Twitter account thanks Navratilova 'for her time and efforts over these last few months' and calls it a 'great experience to work with one of the all time greats.' The post adds that the women 'agreed that as Martina could not commit 100 (percent) to the project then it was not going to work as a long term partnership.' The French Open starts on May 24. Radwanska plays a forehand during her defeat by Sara Errani at the Porsche Grand Prix on Wednesday .
Love the lighting in these photography shots? They become even more awe-inspiring at the realisation that they're paintings, and someone spent between 50 to 300 hours painstakingly creating them. Patrick Kramer is a 33-year-old artist hailing from Springville, Utah, who specialises in remarkably hyper-realistic paintings. Scroll down for video . Action shot: The artwork of 33-year-old Patrick Kramer is so realistic it's impossible to tell apart from a photo. In this image, he has painted a falling woman with a deeply intricate background . The US artist specialises in beautifully in-depth oil painted portraits, including this intricate black and white portrait of a man called Matt . The paintings, including this of a sleeping young girl called Anna, take the artist up to 50 to 300 hours to complete . It's almost impossible to tell that Kramer's flawless creations are in fact oil paintings due to their incredible pin-sharp detail and clarity. His portrayals vary between vivid city scenes, still-life objects, portraits and breathtaking motion-shots. As well as his portfolio of hyper-realistic paintings, he also constructs more surreal variations on still life, involving insects or inanimate objects in front of a background. One of his images is an imitation of the cover art for musician Drake's 2013 album, Nothing Was the Same. Kramer also paints highly-detailed urban shots, which are impossible to tell apart from a photo . His technique involves building layers of oil paint in order to achieve the intense level of detail . The US artist works from photos and builds up delicate layers of oil paint on a board or canvas. This allows him to add controlled detail and subtle shadowing, which appear almost three-dimensional in the pieces of artwork. Kramer has admitted that an oil painting can take anywhere between 50 to 300 hours (one to six weeks) to complete. The length of time taken depends entirely on the size of the painting and the level of detail. The 33-year-old artist has admitted that this type of artwork suits his precise preferences and personality. Kramer also constructs more surreal imagery of insects, which all still have the same high level of detail - including (left) a dragonfly on an intricate background, and (right) Kramer's painting of a butterfly resting on a wad of letters . Cracks in the surface: The artist, from Utah, specialises in creating exceptionally-realistic works of art. In this case, it is a paintbrush against a background of cracked paint . Kramer said: 'Being a perfectionist, I have always been considering art as an outlet for my slightly obsessive personality. The artist's background and education was also important in honing his interests. 'I studied painting in college, and experimented with hyper realism as a way of perfecting my craft. 'I never intended to pursue the style, but found it hard to give up, as it suited my nature.' Kramer's artwork - including this painting of half-filled glasses - is astounding in its level of clarity . Glass half full or half empty? This painting is incredibly detailed, from the fine fish fins to the bubble floating at the top of the glass . Kramer's paintings can vary between still-life of subjects such as paint-brushes (left) and detailed portrayals, such as this harbour (right) Nothing Was the Same: This painting imitates the album cover art for Drake's 2013 album, but swaps Drake for a female model .

'That little bit of brilliance from him wins us the game and gives everyone a big lift. 'Hopefully now we can kick on over our last seven games in the Premier League and in the semi-final.'
It is a fascinating view of exactly what goes into a modern smartphone - and how Samsung does business. The Chipworks site has posted this amazing image revealing the internals of the firm's Galaxy S6, which goes on sale on April 10th. The internals reveal Samsung used more of its own chips to power the new Galaxy S6 smartphone than it did for the predecessor S5, according to an early teardown report, in a blow to U.S. chip supplier Qualcomm. The teardown shows, from the front, the screen, logic board holder, battery, logic board with processor, camera, rear case and antenna. Samsung is not only using its own Exynos mobile processor, as had been widely reported, but also decided to rely on its in-house semiconductor business to source other parts, including the modem and power management integrated circuit chips, Ottawa-based consultancy Chipworks said. Samsung is counting on its new flagship Galaxy S6 and S6 edge phones to help revive earnings momentum after a disappointing 2014. Strong sales of system chips such as its Exynos processor could also help boost earnings, analysts and investors say. The Galaxy S6 also comes with Samsung's Shannon modem chip, U.S. phone carrierAT&T said on its website. 'It's pretty clear if they're using Shannon for the modem for AT&T that they're trying to use all-Samsung silicon,' said Jim McGregor, an analyst at Tirias Research. 'With their market share going down they're under pressure to increase profit margins.' The findings suggest a deeper loss of business for Qualcomm in the new generation of Samsung's flagship handsets than anticipated previously. Teardown reports of the predecessor Galaxy S5, released last year, showed the U.S. chipmaker supplied several components that Samsung has supplanted with its own this year, based on the phone Chipworks investigated. Samsung's new S6 and S6 Edge: The phones are also the first to feature dual-standard wireless charging technology built inside the handsets, and will battle the iPhone and HTC's One . Qualcomm said in January that a key customer declined to use its new Snapdragon processor in an upcoming flagship phone presumed to be Samsung's Galaxy S6. But it had been unclear whether Samsung would drop Qualcomm's modem chips as well. Qualcomm is the industry leader in LTE, the most advanced modem technology, but Samsung, Intel, MediaTek and others have developing their own offerings. Samsung and Qualcomm did not immediately reply to requests for comment.
A mother whose baby nearly died after he was born severely premature has urged other women to be aware of the infection that triggered her early labour. Amanda Butler, 42, had enjoyed a totally normal pregnancy until her waters broke at 25 weeks. Her son Callum was born weighing just 1lb 9oz and with translucent skin - and both she and doctors feared he would not survive. In the weeks and months that followed, he underwent heart surgery, a lumbar puncture, laser eye surgery and 10 blood transfusions. Mrs Butler, a marketing consultant from Milton Keynes, later discovered her premature labour had been triggered by a common infection called bacterial vaginosis (BV). Scroll down for video . Callum Butler was born at just 25 weeks into his mother's pregnancy. His mother Amanda was later told an infection she had, called bacterial vaginosis, was to blame. The condition can also cause miscarriage . BV affects one in three women, making it twice as common as thrush. It occurs when the balance of internal bacteria is disrupted, leading to an unpleasant odour. If untreated, it can lead to fertility problems and increased risk of contracting STIs such as gonorrhoea and chlamydia. Pregnant women with the condition are six times more likely to miscarry and twice as likely to give birth prematurely. One of the biggest problems is that BV often goes undiagnosed - or women wrongly assume they are suffering from another similar ailment, such as thrush. Misdiagnosis often occurs as 38 per cent of women only feel comfortable getting intimate health advice from online forums because while 19 per cent are too embarrassed to talk to their GP, research has shown. Many other women, such as Mrs Butler, have simply never heard of the condition. She said: 'I was angry when I found out that BV had caused Callum’s premature birth because it was the first I had heard of it. 'No-one ever told me the condition could lead to complications like this. 'It wasn't in any of the pregnancy books and was certainly never mentioned by midwives or doctors prior to it happening.' She said she noticed a discharge at around 24 weeks - but didn’t pay it any attention. 'Pregnancy itself can cause that to happen, and it certainly didn’t concern my midwife,' she recalled. 'The discharge didn’t have the characteristic odour that is associated with BV.' After the trauma of the premature labour and birth, Mrs Butler was initially told it had occurred because she had an 'incompetent cervix'. This is a condition that occurs when weak cervical tissue causes the cervix to open too soon - causing premature birth or the loss of an otherwise healthy pregnancy. It was only during a consultation with a specialist two years later that she was horrified to be told an infection must have caused Callum's early arrival. 'I feel like it could have been totally avoided had I been given the right information,' she said. Like many women, Mrs Butler had never heard of the condition. Callum's frail state when he was born meant doctors feared he may not live. 'I feel like it could have been totally avoided had I been given the right information,' his mother said . 'Callum’s experience was awful, and it was incredibly difficult for my husband and I to have to watch him suffer. 'As a new mum, it was heartbreaking not to be able to cuddle my son for weeks after he was born.' She added: 'Today, Callum is a happy, healthy little boy, but I am definitely one of the lucky ones.' She has decided to share her story to raise awareness and prevent other mothers going through the same terrible ordeal. 'I don’t want anyone else to have to go through what Callum endured,' she said. 'I would urge anyone in the early stages of pregnancy who thinks they may have the symptoms of BV to speak to their midwives as soon as possible to ensure this terrible experience doesn’t happen to them.' Around 54,000 babies are born prematurely in UK every year, one of the highest rates in Europe. BV affects one in three women, making it twice as common as thrush. It occurs when the balance of internal bacteria is disrupted, leading to an unpleasant odour. If untreated, it can lead to fertility problems and increased risk of contracting STIs such as gonorrhoea and chlamydia. Pregnant women with the condition are six times more likely to miscarry and twice as likely to give birth prematurely. One of the biggest problems is that BV often goes undiagnosed - or women wrongly assume they are suffering from another similar ailment, such as thrush. Misdiagnosis often occurs as 38 per cent of women only feel comfortable getting intimate health advice from online forums because while 19 per cent are too embarrassed to talk to their GP, research has shown. Symptoms include: . * a strong smell, particularly after sexual intercourse . * discharge that becomes a white or grey colour, or becomes thin and watery . Babies born before 37 weeks are classed as premature and as many of their vital organs will not have had a chance to fully develop causing both short terms problems, such as breathing and digestive difficulties, and potential longer term health implications, such as severe disabilities or cerebral palsy. Her story follows research at the University of California, Los Angeles, which found women who use shower gels and soaps in intimate areas are putting themselves at higher risk of developing BV. Study leader Joelle Brown said there is ‘mounting evidence’ that using these products internally can also increase the risk of bacterial vaginosis. Dr Brown's team recruited 141 women in Los Angeles who agreed to answer questionnaires about their product use and undergo lab tests for vaginal infections. The researchers found that 66 per cent of the women reported using lubricants and cleansers internally. The most commonly used products were sexual lubricants - 70 per cent of the product-using group used commercial lubricants, while 17 per cent reported using petroleum jelly and 13 per cent used oils. Test results showed that the women who used products not intended for internal use, such as oils and Vaseline, were more likely to have yeast and bacterial infections. For instance, 40 per cent of the women who used petroleum jelly as a lubricant had bacterial vaginosis - an infection that can be caused by a number of common bacterial species - compared to 18 per cent of women who did not insert petroleum jelly. Mrs Butler was speaking out for National BV Day, held in association with Balance Activ. For more information on the condition, visit www.bvexplained.co.uk .
Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone has given Azerbaijan the all-clear ahead of its debut next season despite serious concerns over the country's human rights record. Human Rights Watch's 2015 report on the former Soviet republic stated there had been 'a dramatic deterioration in its already poor rights record' particularly in its treatment of opponents of the political regime. However, Ecclestone maintains F1 has conducted its due diligence on Azerbaijan. The capital, Baku, will host a street race to be known as the European Grand Prix. Bernie Ecclestone, speaking in Bahrain, has confirmed Azerbaijan will stage the European Grand Prix . The race will be held in the capital of Baku, despite the country's poor human rights record . Asked whether Azerbaijan's human rights record would be checked, the 84-year-old replied: 'We have. 'I think everybody seems to be happy. There doesn't seem to be any big problem there. 'There's no question of it not being on the calendar. It's going to be another good race.' The sport recently published a 'Statement of Commitment to Respect for Human Rights' that was posted on the formula1.com website. It said: 'The Formula One Group is committed to respecting internationally recognised human rights in its operations globally. 'Whilst respecting human rights in all of our activities, we focus our efforts in relation to those areas which are within our own direct influence.' It added that the sport would also 'identify and assess...any actual or potential adverse human rights impacts with which we may be involved either through our own activities or as a result of our business relationships, including, but not limited to, our suppliers and promoters.' Lewis Hamilton celebrates another victory at the Bahrain Grand Prix . The Mercedes driver has now won three of the opening four races this season . The Human Rights Watch report on Azerbaijan for 2015 was pretty damning. 'The Azerbaijani government escalated repression against its critics, marking a dramatic deterioration in its already poor rights record,' the report states. 'The authorities convicted or imprisoned at least 33 human rights defenders, political and civil activists, journalists, and bloggers on politically motivated charges, prompting others to flee the country or go into hiding. 'Authorities froze the bank accounts of independent civic groups and their leaders, impeded their work by refusing to register foreign grants, and imposed foreign travel bans on some. 'Many of those detained complained of ill-treatment in police custody. Many organisations, including several leading rights groups, were forced to cease activities.' Concerns remain, however, over the Italian Grand Prix, one of the most historic races in F1. Hamilton leads the 2014 Italian Grand Prix, although Monza's future on the circuit is uncertain . Ecclestone is currently negotiating with promoters at Monza over a new contract, with the current one due to expire after next year's race. Officials have made it clear they can no longer afford Ecclestone's terms and are hoping he will reduce his fees. Ecclestone, though, seems unconcerned at losing F1's heartland of Europe as key races such as those at Imola, France and Germany have disappeared. 'We have to wait and see. They don't have an agreement. Bit like Germany really,' said Ecclestone. Suggested to Ecclestone it was unthinkable the race could be dropped, he replied: 'I tell you something, I was told that when we didn't have a race in France actually. And Germany now. We've got some good replacements, haven't we?'
'Nurse death': Vera Maresova, 50, has confessed to killing five women and one man at the hospital . A former nurse in the Czech Republic has admitted murdering six of her elderly patients with massive doses of potassium in order to ease her workload. Vera Maresova, 50, confessed to killing five women and one man over a four-year period at a hospital in  Rumburk - a small town in the north of the country. Dubbed 'Nurse Death' by local media, Maresova was initially arrested over the death of a 70-year-old woman last August, but has now admitted killing five more people between 2010 and 2014 following a police investigation. According to the prosecution, Maresova injected the potassium straight into the blood stream of her six elderly patients, which caused them to suffer heart failure and eventually death. All of her victims were already in the intensive care unit at the hospital and it is believed Maresova thought their deaths would simply be attributed to natural causes. Initially arrested last August for the death of one patient, a 70-year-old woman who died from potassium poisoning in June, Maresova subsequently admitted killing five others dating back to 2010. In total her victims included five women and one man. 'All of her victims were elderly and needed intensive treatment,' a police spokesperson said. 'The woman who was supposed to care for them but instead killed them because she wanted to make life easier for herself,' he added. 'The terrible number of victims is six. We do not suspect the nurse committed any more murders';, he went on to say. Confession: Vera Maresova (right) was initially arrested over the death of a 70-year-old woman last August, but has now admitted killing five more people between 2010 and 2014 following a police investigation . Sick: All of her victims were already in the intensive care unit at the hospital and it is believed Vera Maresova (pictured covering her house outside court) thought their deaths would be attributed to natural causes . Location: Vera Maresova killed five women and one man over a four-year period at this hospital in Rumburk - a small town in the north of the Czech Republic . Prosecutor Frantisek Stibor said: 'She is not insane and knew exactly what she was doing. Therefore she is fit to stand trial. 'She used her knowledge of medicine to cause malfunctions in heart rhythms which led to heart failure and death.' The first murder was in January 2010 and was followed by another at the end of 2011. In April 2012 she killed her third victim and three more between February and June 2014. Having confessed to the crime, 50-year-old Maresova now faces the prospect of spending the rest of her life in prison.

She said: 'I can’t wait to get out to Portugal to shoot and see what beautiful pieces I will be modelling! 'I’m sure the next year will be lots of fun.

Has this brilliant 79th Masters got one final twist to reveal come the final round on Sunday? No-one would be surprised following the dramatic events of the third round, when the three biggest names in the sport combined with Justin Rose to throw the veritable kitchen sink at the cool 21 year old Texan Jordan Spieth. The young American coped so adeptly he gave up just one shot of his five stroke halfway lead and will partner Rose in the final round armed with a useful advantage. But there was just enough vulnerability shown in his finish to offer encouragement not only to Rose but Masters specialist Phil Mickelson, who will start five behind. Spieth is the third player his age to take a healthy lead into the final round. It worked out perfectly for Tiger Woods in 1997 but not so well for Rory McIlroy in 2011, who collapsed under the pressure over the final nine holes. ‘I think Jordan will cope better than I did because he was in the final group last year,’ said McIlroy. ‘I certainly expect him to cope a lot better than I did.’ Jordan Spieth carded a double bogey on the 17th but still set a new 54-hole scoring record at the Masters . At 16 under par, Spieth broke the record shared by Ray Floyd and Tiger Woods by a single shot . The other thing Spieth has in his favour is that this is the fourth tournament in a row when he has been in the final group in the final round. He won one and finished runner-up in the other two. If he wins, he will go to number two in the world and the rivalry with Rory that might dominate golf for the next decade will have begun. Spieth looked to have taken the tournament beyond everyone else when he went seven strokes clear with just two holes to play. But while Rose finished off with a staggering fifth birdie in his last six holes, Spieth was running up his first double bogey of the tournament at the 17th. And at the last there was a horrible fanned approach that threatened to trim the lead to just three, before Spieth conjured up a remarkable up and down to give him momentum heading into what promises to be another momentous Masters Sunday. Plucky journeyman Charley Hoffman lies fourth while Woods and McIlroy both shot 68 to be tied fifth and will play together on Sunday. But at ten shots off the pace they are surely too far behind. As for Rose, the 2013 US Open champion has given himself the chance of seizing another major following his astonishing finish. Pick of the quintet of birdies came at the par three 16th, where he holed a spectacular bunker shot. ‘I think it’s important to be in the final group, it’s where you want to be,’ said the 34 year old Englishman. ‘Jordan is obviously playing some very special golf but I have definitely given myself an opportunity.’ World No 1 Rory McIlroy and 14-time major winner Tiger Woods were in a five-way tie for fifth . Finally, the real McIlroy showed upon the par fives at Augusta on Saturday . What a day we had on Saturday. It was as if Rose and the big three in terms of charisma had come up with an unspoken pact and declared: ‘Ok, let’s see if this kid Jordan is really destined for greatness.’ For those who thought the runaway halfway leader had merely to turn up to claim the green jacket, we had McIlroy playing like the world number one and Tiger confounding the sceptics with a bravura display that made you feel the last 12 months had all been a bad dream. There was the glorious sight of Mickelson playing once more like he owns Augusta. And then there was Rose, who has had a lot of good days at Augusta in his ten Masters tournaments and now was enjoying one more. How would you like to see all that taking place in your rear view mirror, at this of all courses? In short, for five simply incredible hours the roars were echoing all over this sacred property and for most of that time they were funnelling in Spieth’s direction. This was undoubtedly as severe an examination as you could imagine for a third round. Just as well, then, that the creed that has served him so well already during his phenomenal 18 months as a professional just happens to be: ’Whenever the heat is on, ensure you focus just that little bit more.’ And that, for the most part, is just what he did. Only at the end did he look like stumbling, but that fabulous up and down at the last kept everything upbeat. Tiger Woods put on a vintage show, he was astonishing, electric, inspired and charismatic . Woods' girlfriend Lindsey Vonn showed her support during the third round on Saturday . The previous 54 hole standard of 15 under was set by Ray Floyd in 1976 and Woods in 1997. But the youngest first round leader in Masters history and the man who set a new low mark for 36 holes on Friday had reached 16 under after a 70. What made this so impressive was that, for the first time, a few errors crept into his previously immaculate game. During the round he would have three three putts and his first double. When things like this happen here it’s so easy for the mind to unravel but Spieth kept his composure. At the par five second that peerless putting stroke rapped home another birdie putt and one more at the sixth. At the treacherous 9th he seemed to have left himself a difficult second shot, from a downhill lie to an elevated green. Spieth knocked his approach to 6ft and holed that one as well to turn in 35 shots. In its own way, this was the equal of his spectacular bouts of scoring in the first two rounds. So it continued. The two stringent par fours to start the back nine were safely negotiated before his tee shot to the par three 12th came down 8ft from the flag. You can guess what happened next, and he birdied the 13th as well. He would threeputt the 14th, however – and then came the next test. Phil Mickelson played like the Masters specialist to finish the third round on 11 under . Justin Rose reeled off five birdies in the last six holes to move into second place on 12 under . As he made his way down the 15th fairway, first Mickelson and then Rose made amazing birdies at the 16th to send the crowd into raptures. How would he respond? Well, at the 15th he calmly stroked a four iron into the middle of the green for a two putt birdie. Best of all was the eight iron he struck to 8ft at the 16th for yet another birdie. McIlroy, Woods and Mickelson all shot sumptuous front nines of 32 shots. Mickelson was wearing a salmon pink shirt in honour of Arnold Palmer. Some of his great attacking play had been delivered wearing just such a colour and Mickelson was doing justice to the memory. Eight strokes off the pace at the start of play, he’s still in the ball game but will need another magic-filled round today. Add McIlroy’s wonderful back nine 31 from Friday afternoon to his front nine 32 yesterday, and you would have a round that equalled the course record of 63. Amazing how the switch flipped for him at the halfway point in the second round. So tentative to that point and perhaps a touch nervous with all that was at stake, it was as if he looked at a leaderboard that showed him 17 shots off the lead and a stroke outside the projected halfway cut and decided: ‘To hell with it, let’s go for it.’ Finally, the real McIlroy showed up on the par fives, those scoring holes that have given him such problems in recent years. An eagle at the 13th on Friday was followed by an eagle on the second in his third round. He was off and running. He birdied the long 8th plus the 13th and 15th for his best-ever return on the par fives during a single round at the Masters. A poor eight iron to the 16th cost him, however, as a 6ft par putt was dribbled miserably. Another bogey at the last as well meant a 68. And so the likely list of winners stands at just three – Spieth, Rose and Mickelson. It should be some final day. It has been some tournament.
An eight-year-old girl, who lost her leg in a terrible accident last year, has given her first solo dance performance since she became an amputee eleven months ago - earning a standing ovation for her moving routine. Alissa Sizemore, from Vernal, Utah, was only seven-years-old when a truck ran over her foot and immediately severed it. Although the dancer, who has been taking lessons since she was four-years-old, had to have her right leg amputated below the knee, she was determined to get back in the dance studio as soon as possible. 'I just didn't want to give up,' Alissa told People. 'Dancing has been my favorite thing since I was four. I don't have part of my leg, but I can't let that stop me. I still want to dance.' Scroll down for video . Major Inspiration: Alissa Sizemore can be seen dancing on a wooden bench during her first solo dance performance since she lost her leg in an accident last May . Alissa, who was fitted for her prosthetic leg in September, chose Colbie Caillat's hit Try, a song that she and her mom felt accurately reflected her emotional journey over the past year, for her debut performance, in which she removed her artificial limb as a part of her routine. Alissa's mom Heather proudly shared a video of her daughter's performance last month on her YouTube channel. The clip shows Alissa donning a seafoam green ballet costume as she confidently walks toward a bench set up in the middle of Vernal's high school gymnasium, where the recital took place. The impressive little girl performs a series of leg stretches and even a cartwheel before she removed her prosthetic limb. Unstoppable girl: The eight-year-old lifted her prosthetic limb while balancing on one leg for her routine, which was set to Colbie Caillat's hit Try . Dare devil: She even did a cartwheel in the middle of her performance at a high school gymnasium in in Vernal, Utah . Determined: Towards the end of her emotional dance, Alissa removed her artificial leg and continued her routine on the floor, where she did a bridge and a forward roll . After removing her artificial leg, she continues her routine on the floor, proving that she will always be able to dance - with or without her leg. The teary-eyed audience was so moved by her dancing that she was given a standing ovation - a fantastic end to an emotional year. And one which will hopefully help to dull the memory of the horrific accident which left her in pain for months. Last May, Alissa was playing outside with her sister Cyley, 10, and some of her friends when she ran past a few garbage cans that were pulled to the curb just as a truck was breaking to a stop. Alissa's right foot was pinned underneath the tire. She was immediately flown to Vernal to Primary Children's Medical Center in Salt Lake City, but doctors were unable to save her leg. Amazing recovery: Alissa was photographed warming up for ballet class at Powerhouse Dance Studio last month . In sync: She can be seen performing a routine with the other girls in her class . Star treatment: Alissa got her hair done before she was filmed dancing in the music video for Utah musical trio Gentri's song Dare . Alissa was reliant on a wheelchair or crutches before she was fitted for her artificial leg, but she was secretly doing uncomplicated dance moves in the studio her father had built for her and her sisters. While Alissa adjusted to her new reality, her neighborhood community banded together to help raise money for her surgeries and her prosthetic leg, which weren't completely covered by the family's health insurance. When her mom took her and her sisters to Powerhouse Dance Studio last summer for fall tryouts, it was thought that Alissa would help with the music until she was ready to return to dance - but she had other plans. Say cheese: The little girl posed for this photo with Casey Elliott, Brad Robins and Bradley Quinn Lever, who make up the group . Inspiring words: In the music video, Alissa holds up a sign that reads: 'Dare to dream.' 'She handed me her crutches and said she was trying out,' her mom told People. 'She hopped to the middle of the room and gave it her all. She wasn't going to let anybody hold her back.' Alissa's amazing story inspired Utah musical trio Gentri to feature her in the music video for their song Dare. Throughout the clip, which debuted earlier this month, Alissa can be seen attaching her prosthetic leg before she starts dancing. The footage also shows her holding up pictures of herself during her recovery last year, as well as a newspaper article about her recent dance recital. Towards the end of the video, Alissa raises a sign that reads: 'Dare to dream.' Brave face: Alissa curled up with her stuffed animals as she and her mom Heather smiled for the camera last year after her accident . Huge adjustment: The young girl, pictured with her mom, relied on a wheelchair and crutches to get around before she was fitted for her prosthetic leg in September .
A woman mocked after she purchased a camera that allowed her to watch her cats from work is getting the last laugh. On Monday afternoon, the New York City woman, who is not being named, watched in terror as a man crawled through a window and proceeded to steal her laptop, digital camera and some jewelry from her apartment, getting out with the goods in just minutes. Unfortunately for the thief, the entire thing was caught on camera. A New York City woman caught a man robbing her apartment after he was captured on her cat camera . The woman is now thrilled she purchased the device and has handed the video over to police . 'I had to watch it a couple of times and be like, this guy is in my apartment and looking at my stuff,' said the woman (above) 'People thought I was crazy to spend $200 on a camera, plus another $100 a year to record the video so I could watch my cats,' the woman told NBC 4. 'But it really unexpectedly came in handy.' The thief took her laptop, jewelry and a digital camera . Anyone who recognizes the man in the video is asked to contact Crime Stoppers at 800-577-TIPS . The robbery was confirmed just moments after the man left when the woman says she received a notification that an app had been disabled on her iPad. 'I had to watch it a couple of times and be like, this guy is in my apartment and looking at my stuff,' she said. Now, the $200 camera and $100 annual fee may mean that this woman will get her property back, and that this man will end up behind bars. Said the woman; 'If I didn't have this, there's no way I would know when it happened, how he came in, what was touched, what was compromised.' Anyone who recognizes the man in the video is asked to contact Crime Stoppers at 800-577-TIPS.
Kristen Lindsey from Brenham, Texas, allegedly hunted the animal down and shot it with a bow believing it was feral and then posted the image on Facebook . A veterinarian has been fired from her clinic after she posted a horrifying image of her holding a cat she had killed by firing an arrow into its head on Facebook. Kristen Lindsey, 31, who lives in Brenham, Texas, allegedly hunted the animal down in her backyard and shot it with a bow, believing it was feral. But a local rescue center say the cat, believed to be called Tiger, was domesticated and had been missing for around two weeks. Beneath the shocking image, Lindsey, a Wyoming native, wrote: 'My first bow kill... lol. The only good feral tomcat is one with an arrow through it's head. Vet of the year award... gladly accepted.' She also said in a comment, before she learned she no longer had a job: 'And no I did not lose my job. Psshh. Like someone would get rid of me. I'm awesome.' The Colorado State graduate lost her job at the Washington Animal Clinic after the image began circulating online and staff have since been distancing themselves from the former employee. Staff at released a statement on Facebook on Friday saying: 'We are absolutely appalled, shocked, upset, and disgusted by the conduct. 'We have parted ways with Ms. Lindsey. We do not allow such conduct and we condemn it in the strongest possible manner,' the clinic said in the statement.' 'Please know that when informed of this we responded swiftly and appropriately and please do not impute this awful conduct to the Washington Animal Clinic or any of its personnel.' Local prosecutors are now considering whether she should face criminal charges. A Facebook page, called 'justice for the cat murdered by Kirsten Lindsey'  has already been 'liked' by more than 7,000 people. A video of the six-year-old cat that Lindsey is believed to have killed riding on top of a tractor has also surfaced online. Scroll down for video . Lindsey, pictured with her mother Becky, said after the picture was uploaded that she didn't lose her job - claiming no one would fire her because she is 'awesome'. However she later learned she had been fired . Local prosecutors are now considering whether she should face criminal charges. She was also slammed online with a number of people saying she should lose her veterinarian licence . Austin County Sheriff Jack Brandes says he was disturbed by the image. He told KBTX: 'This kind of stuff shouldn't happen in our society,' Brandes said. 'It's a very sad thing. 'Hopefully we will get to the bottom of it and get the truth, 100 per cent truth, and get it to the DA and put it in his hands if it needs to go any further.' The Texas Veterinary Medical Association also condemned her reactions, insisting her conduct does not reflect the standards of other vets. In a statement, they said: 'The Texas Veterinary Medical Association (TVMA) strongly condemns the actions of a veterinarian who claims to have recently shot and killed a feral cat with the use of a bow and arrow. 'The veterinarian, who worked in Brenham, Texas, and is not a TVMA member, posted a picture of herself holding the deceased cat on her personal Facebook page along with some insensitive remarks about the incident. A video of the six-year-old cat that Lindsey is believed to have killed riding on top of a tractor has also surfaced online . The Colorado State graduate lost her job at the Washington Animal Clinic (pictured) after the image began circulating online. She has yet to respond to the image . 'This individual’s actions directly violate the veterinarian’s oath taken to use his or her “scientific knowledge and skills for the benefit of society through the protection of animal health and welfare, the prevention and relief of animal suffering, the conservation of animal resources, the promotion of public health and the advancement of medical knowledge.” 'We are saddened and disturbed by the unfortunate actions of this individual, and we remind Texas residents that this conduct is not reflective of the veterinary profession or of the veterinarians who strive to embody the words of the veterinarian’s oath every day. 'Upon learning of the troubling misconduct, the Brenham clinic where the veterinarian was practicing immediately condemned her actions and terminated her employment. 'The clinic’s ownership and staff have expressed their deepest shock and disgust at such behavior and are regretful that the individual acted in a manner that so drastically deviated from the conduct and values the clinic has upheld in its community for years. 'We hope you will stand strong with us against this type of behavior against animals. TVMA values the trust built between veterinarians and the public based on mutually shared care for animals. The clinic issued a statement confirming Lindsey had been fired and distanced themselves from the employee. They said they were 'disgusted' by her conduct . 'We hope that we can unite to prevent actions like this from occurring in the future. She was also condemned online by a number of people in her profession. Larry Wallace, who said he had been a veterinarian for 40 years, said on Facebook: 'I have never in my long career heard of such an atrocious act by a member of my profession. 'This person most be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. 'She took an oath to protect and heal not to killing innocent life. I will be contacting my national association about this matter as she has tarnished the profession for which she has chosen.' Underneath the clinic's statement, Sheilah Christensen wrote: 'She needs to be in jail for animal abuse - follow your state state statutes re animal abuse. Take her license away -- my God, what did she do to the animals in her care at your clinic.' Cruelty to animals is a Class A misdemeanor under penal code 42.092: “A person commits an offense if the person intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly tortures an animal or in a cruel manner kills or causes serious bodily injury to an animal.” Lindsey interned at Equine Sports Medicine & Surgery in Weatherford from 2012 to 2013. She created a personal blog called Wyo-Girl-Kristen Lindsey and posted about herself in 2011, saying: 'I love Wyoming and the mountains....the Big Horns especially...but any will do when it really comes down to it. 'I love hunting, fly fishing, pack trips, the outdoors in general, horses, skiing, dancing, whiskey, my friends, my family, God, raising hell, my daddy, and sheep.'
Andy Murray arrived back in Britain on Monday restored as world No 3 in the new rankings — but set aside thoughts of that to focus on his wedding in Dunblane this weekend. And despite his recent tournament finishes getting him back near the top of the game, the 27-year-old Scot confirmed it will be a down-to-earth guest list when he marries fiancée Kim Sears in his hometown on Saturday. There are believed to be well over 100 people attending, but star spotters will find celebrities in short supply as the couple focus on celebrating with family and genuine friends. Andy Murray celebrates winning a point in the second set against Novak Djokovic  in the mens final . Novak Djokovic  plays a backhand against Murray  in the mens final during the Miami Open . Murray plays a forehand against Djokovic  in the final during the Miami Open  at Crandon Park Tennis Center . ‘There’ll be no celebrities as such, I don’t have any celebrity friends so it wasn’t something that was planned,’ said Murray, before he flew back after his Miami Open final defeat to runaway world No 1 Novak Djokovic on Sunday. The one possible exception is comedian James Corden, although he is busy working in America. There will be quite a few friends prominent in British tennis — aside from anything Kim’s father Nigel has been one of the country’s leading coaches — but with the Monte Carlo Open beginning next Monday the bigger international names were always going to be otherwise engaged. Murray and Djokovic pose for a photograph prior to the mens final during the Miami Open . Djokovic holds the winners trophy after defeating Murray in the final of the Miami Open . In fact the only non-British player likely to attend is Jean-Julien Rojer, a doubles specialist from the Dutch Antilles who has a base in Miami. ‘Jules lives there and I spend quite a lot of time with him. Tim (Henman) will be coming. James Ward, Jamie Delgado (longstanding British player and coach). ‘We invited Kyle Edmund but he can’t make it because he’s playing,’ said Murray, who confirmed the couple will not cash in on photography rights to any magazines. Other tennis guests include coach Amelie Mauresmo, former assistant coach Dani Vallverdu and two of his three best men, brother Jamie and former Davis Cup player Ross Hutchins. The third is Carlos Mier, a friend from his days at the Barcelona tennis academy he attended. Kim Sears fiancee of Murray  watches him in action against Djokovic in the fierce Miami sun . ‘Everyone who we’re close to, people we’ve spent a lot of time with in the past and people that we see ourselves spending time with in the future. That’s how we came up with the list,’ said Murray. Rather than asking for wedding gifts, the couple have requested that guests make a donation to charities they support such as UNICEF and the World Wildlife Fund. ‘I’m going to go up to Scotland early and spend time with my family for a couple of days. I’m not going to hit any balls this week. Pretty much everything is done now and under control. I’m sure a few things will come up. World No 3 Murray is set to marry his fiancee Sears in Dunblane next Saturday . ‘Kim has pretty much controlled most of the important things and I’ve tried to help when she’s asked. I haven’t been overly involved but there’s things I enjoy doing, I did all the food and cake tasting which I actually loved.’ There will not be any honeymoon until later in the year. In the middle of next week Murray will head to Barcelona to train with incoming assistant coach, former Swedish player Jonas Bjorkman, before resuming his tournament schedule the week after that in Munich. Another change in the new rankings on Monday was Spaniard Rafael Nadal moving down to No 5.
The leader of France's far-right has been named one of Time magazine's 100 most influential people alongside President Barack Obama, Pope Francis and Kanye West. National Front leader Marine Le Pen, 46, who took over from her father in 2011, says it shows that her party's brand of political change is getting attention on both sides of the Atlantic. In an interview before a dinner in honour of the Time 100 ion New York on Tuesday, the leader of the staunchly anti-immigration Front spoke of representing a 'great political force'. Anti-immigrant honoured: The leader of right-wing National Front, Marine Le Pen, 46, said being one of the Time 100, shows that her party's brand of political change is getting attention on both sides of the Atlantic . 'People are taking note of the political upheavals that are happening, a great political force that I represent tonight - and that tomorrow can perhaps change the face of decisions that are made not just in France, but perhaps in Europe,' Le Pen said. The recognition comes at an eventful time for Le Pen, who recently announced she would oppose her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, on his candidacy in France's regional elections in December. Earlier this month, Le Pen Snr, who founded National Front in 1972, infuriated his daughter  with a series of racist and anti-Semitic remarks. The 86-year-old  had repeated his claim that the Holocaust was ‘a detail of history’ and had also praised France’s wartime leader Marshal Petain, who collaborated with Hitler. This angered Marine, who said she would not back him in the elections and accused him of ‘political suicide’. Far-right views: Before The Time 100 gala in New York, the leader of the staunchly anti-immigration Front spoke of representing a 'great political force' in Europe . Family feud: Marine, who took over leadership of the party from her father Jean-Marie, 86, in 2011 recently accused him of 'political suicide' after he repeated his claim that the Holocaust was ‘a detail of history’ After this, Jean-Marie Le Pen told French publication Le Figaro that he was withdrawing his candidacy  in the south-east Provence-Alpes-Cote d’Azur region ‘even though I think I am the best candidate’. The former paratrooper said it was because the party was at risk of being ‘dangerously weakened’ over what he called a severe but unjustified crisis over his comments. Mr Le Pen, who remains the Front’s honorary president, said the best replacement candidate would be his grand-daughter Marion Marechal-Le Pen, 25, who confirmed shortly after that she would seek the party’s nomination. Marine Le Pen declined Tuesday to discuss what she thought would be an appropriate punishment but said the party 'can no longer be the hostage of views that are personal views and that certainly contradict the political action of the National Front.'

Since taking over from her father in 2011, Le Pen has pushed to rid the party of its extreme right-wing past and recast it as a voter-friendly option for people frustrated with France's direction and traditional parties.

A woman who chartered her own weightloss success with body selfies found it so beneficial, she launched an app offering others the chance to do the same thing. Charlotte Li, 26, from London, decided to design Healthy Selfie with her husband Joe after they both achieved incredible results taking photos of their bodies while on a health kick. She said the idea for it came after an over-indulgent Christmas left her feeling ‘fat and unhealthy’. Scroll down for video . Charlotte reveals how taking selfies helped her to stay motivated to get fit and stay in shape . Charlotte said: 'With no holidays on the horizon and hence no impending bikini body exposure to panic about, we needed something else to give us some motivation to get in the gym. 'That motivation came in the form of stripping down to my bra and pants, and taking my first body selfie. 'I was by no means overweight, however, by looking at my body objectively, I wasn’t happy with what I saw and I decided I needed to make a change. 'I started a new fitness programme, and started eating reasonably healthily.’ Joe also charted his own success through a series of selfies before he and Charlotte decided to launch Healthy Selfie. Charlotte continued to take photos each week and would compare them to see how far she had come. She said: 'At the end of a six-week period, I compared the images with the help of Joe’s Photoshop expertise. 'The results were incredible – my body had completely changed – all in complete contradiction to the number on the scales - which had risen as I gained more muscle.' Charlotte and Joe (right) launched  the app after taking selfies  following an an indulgent Christmas . Joe charted his own success through a series of selfies before he and Charlotte decided to launch the app . Charlotte said: 'This was where the idea for Healthy Selfie was born. We wanted to create an app that made tracking and comparing your selfies a quick and easy process. 'By then publishing those photos in a social networking environment, the images become so much more than a self-tracking tool – they become a source of information from which other users can glean ideas and inspiration. 'Your images become testaments to the efficacy of whatever programme, diet, detox or cleanse you’re pursuing.' Charlotte says the app also provides a safe and supportive community for you to upload your pictures too, with users using the comments section to encourage each other on their journeys. Two people who have used the app said it helped them to overcome their own body issues. A student who was told he would never have a six-pack finally achieved his dream. When Harry was at college (left) he was told by his friends that he would never achieve a six pack, now he shows off his super fit body on Healthy Selfie (right) Harry's profile on Healthy Selfie shows how he is getting fitter week by week . Harry Kersley, 20, student: . Harry Kersley, 20, said he used to receive harsh criticism from the other boys at his college but is now proud of his body. Harry was told about the app by a friend at the gym. He said: 'I lacked confidence throughout school at Epsom College. 'The initial reason for starting my transformation was to improve strength as well as fitness for sport. 'However I received harsh “banter” from my peers at school and I recall one friend saying I will never get a six pack. I allowed this to fuel my determination to this day.' Harry says using the app he charted his progress: 'It's given me a great confidence boost, and yes, I definitely feel encouraged to continue posting progress pics. 'If you ever start doubting your progress; looking at old photos make you realise just how much your physique has improved. 'No one expects to become Arnold Schwarzenegger overnight, but the small incremental changes that you don’t notice from just looking in the mirror every day, is what kept me motivated to continue. 'You can't see how much you've progressed if you don't keep a record. I'm now using Healthy Selfie to track my aesthetic progression, and have seen drastic changes in my muscle definition and fat loss. ‘I feel great and definitely in the best physical condition of my life.' Anonymous, 17 . This anonymous anorexia sufferer used Healthy Selfie to chart her recovery process, posting selfies as she regained weight and muscle . A 17-year-old woman – who didn’t want to be named – revealed the app helped her fight anorexia, which started at 14, including helping her to regain weight and muscle. She said: 'I really got into healthy eating because I wanted to lose weight. 'My friend was a synchronised swimmer and she was so toned, I wanted to look just like her. ‘I joined a fitness club at school, got quite strong and pretty toned; I looked good. 'But it became obsessive: my “healthy” eating got so restrictive I was living off salads and fruit. I exercised every day, to the point of collapsing. ‘I ate less and less, thinking that was the key to being healthy, but I was so wrong. 'It took time for the weight to come off, and these habits continued on until I was 16. The user posted pictures of herself in the gym as she trained  to regain a healthy body with tone and muscle . 'I was diagnosed with anorexia. That really shocked me, because I didn’t feel like anything was wrong with me.' The user posted pictures of herself in the gym as she trained hard to regain a healthy body with tone and muscle . She revealed: 'I thought about what I wanted to be like before my eating disorder took a hold of me. I wanted to be strong and muscular, toned and fit.’ She started charting her transformation on Instagram but moved over the Healthy Selfie when it launched in January. She said: 'I think selfies are a great idea, especially for people with eating disorders. 'It allows you to see how much healthier you are. Not just in your body, but your face is filled out again, your eyes actually have a sparkle in them, your smile is real.’
John Truong thought he was helping his sister have a nice night out with her boyfriend. Instead, he ended up an unknowing accomplice to a bizarre abduction. Police arrested Truong's sister Alyssa Chang this week after she allegedly helped kidnap 2-year-old Ronnie Tran and his mother, with the child's grandmother, 65-year-old Vien Nguyen. Authorities say Chang and Nguyen incapacitated the child's mother at her home in Des Moines, Washington, bound her with plastic ties and then took the two to another home in Fife. Chang and the grandmother then took off the the toddler, leaving the mother locked in a cupboard. An Amber Alert was issued for the boy Tuesday night, after the mother managed to escape and find help. Scroll down for video . Babysitting: John Truong agreed to babysit 2-year-old Ronnie Tran (pictured) on Tuesday. He says his sister dropped off the boy, saying the toddler was her boyfriend's son and they wanted to go on a date night . That same night, Truong says his sister asked him to babysit the toddler he had never met before, saying it was her boyfriend's son and they wanted to go out on a date night. She promised to pick up the boy in the morning, but she never returned and eventually stopped answering her brother's messages. It wasn't until the next day that Truong realized he was harboring an abducted child when he read an Amber Alert on online. 'I'm eating my breakfast, I'm checking my Facebook, all of a sudden I see this Amber Alert for this child,' Truong recounted to KOMO. 'And it looks like this child in my bed, and I'm like, "Oh my God! What's going on?"' Truong then called police to report that he was watching the boy, who they found safe, sound an unhurt at his home. Safe and sound: Truong was reading Facebook in the morning when he realized that Ronnie had been abducted from his mother. He then called police, and they picked up the boy (above). Truong's sister Alyssa Chang has since been arrested in connection to the bizarre kidnapping . He says the boy appeared fine the night before, enjoying a quiet night in watching movies and eating popcorn. 'He was a great kid. He didn't cry much or anything. He enjoyed my dog's company and my children's company,' Tuong said. Truong says he was completely taken aback by his sister's arrest in the bizarre kidnapping. 'I feel like she was just helping her boyfriend out and just got into this horrible situation,' he said. 'We're family people, this is definitely not like this. Honestly I'm at a loss for words right now. It's just crazy.' In the aftermath of the incident, Chang was arrested on charges of kidnapping, assault and unlawful imprisonment and is being held on $250,000 bail. Nguyen later turned herself into police and was questioned for several hours. Detectives have yet to reveal a motive for the crime. 'Our detectives are currently investigating this case,' said Sgt Mike Graddon of the Des Moines Police told King 5. 'It's very, very complex, and that is all the information we have at this point, but Ronnie has been found.'
Tyler MacNiven became known to millions when the aspiring filmmaker won the ninth season of The Amazing Race, and a $1million prize, and now it seems he may have used some of that money to create one epic save the date. MacNiven and his fiancee, Kelly Hennigan, made a three-minute film to give friends and family a heads up on their fast approaching nuptials, and the two went all out in the process. The video, inspired by action films, shows the two literally saving 'the date' as they wash up on shore, fight friends disguised as villains and ultimately escape from one very large explosion. And, most importantly, it lets everyone know they should not make plans for September 26, 2015. Scroll down for video .

The video ends with the couple, dressed in a tuxedo and wedding dress, enjoying a boat ride with friends under the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. And while MacNiven was able to use his Amazing Race experience to film the action-packed clip, Hennigan also had something to draw from as her brother is WWE superstar John Morrison. Now word yet if the save-the-date video, which first appeared in the site Broke Ass Stuart, also comes with a magnet for guests to put on their refrigerator.
James Webster, 35, was spared jail after admitting outraging public decency . A voyeur who used a hidden camera to film up women's skirts as they bent over freezers in Lidl has been spared jail. James Webster targeted female shoppers at the Lidl store in Maidenhead, Berkshire, as they hunted for bargains in the large chest freezers. The 35-year-old was caught after attracting the attention of a fellow shopper, who spotted him moving the bag he was carrying closer to his unsuspecting victim. Security guards discovered Webster had cut a hole in the bag through which he placed the lens of a camera so he could carry out his covert filming. He admitted outraging public decency at a previous hearing and was warned that he could face prison. But Webster walked free from court after magistrates sitting in Slough, Berkshire, ordered him to complete a sexual offences treatment programme, as part of a three year community order. Opening the case, Helen Gambrill said: 'On January 12 the defendant was in Lidl in Maidenhead and outraged the public decency, namely filming up the skirts of women in that store. 'That offence came to light when a member of the public saw the defendant and thought he was acting in a strange way.' The court heard the shopper spotted Webster positioning his satchel, with a lens protruding out, under the skirt of a woman. Webster, who at the time was living in shared accommodation in White Waltham, near Maidenhead, was confronted by security guards and tried to cover the lens before denying any wrong-doing. However, after seeing an appeal for witnesses to the crime in a local newspaper he turned himself in to police. Webster  immediately showed remorse, telling a police officer, 'I threw the camera away in frustration on the day I did this.' He accepted that his actions had a sexual purpose but admitted he had no idea why he had carried out the crime. Francis Domingo, defending, said Webster had been struggling to deal with a break-up at the time and was incredibly ashamed at his actions. 'From the moment I've seen him, I can tell you this - Mr Webster has expressed nothing but sincere remorse over what took place,' he said. Webster, now of Fengate, Marsham, near Norwich, had been smoking cannabis around the time of the incident, but was now clean, the court was told. Webster had targeted women as the shopped at Lidl in Maidenhead, Berkshire (pictured) Sentencing him, Presiding magistrate Mark Lovett said: 'We note the early guilty plea and the fact that you were very upfront about it from the very beginning. 'You were remorseful for your actions. 'On the other hand, you did show obvious intention - you went equipped. This was hardly accidental.' He added: 'The other point I have to make is that you're not 18, you're 35, for goodness sake. 'That kind of action from someone of your mature years is quite extraordinary.' Webster was handed a three year community order  and was ordered to take part in a sexual offences treatment programme. He was also told to pay £85 in costs and a £60 fine.
He has long struggled to convince voters that he is a suitable choice for prime minister. Now Ed Miliband has hired a leadership coaching firm that helps people overcome anxiety and find their ‘inner voice’. The consultants drafted in by the Labour leader claim to work with politicians to build ‘leadership skills’ using ‘neuroscience’ and ‘business psychology’. Scroll down for video . Ed Miliband, pictured, has hired a US guru who can help him convince himself that he can be Prime Minister . Mr Miliband, pictured, has constantly lagged behind Prime Minister David Cameron in the personal rating polls . Services offered by ExtendedMind include coaching on how to look ‘authentic’ and tutorials on how to build alliances – which may come in useful during negotiations with SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon. The firm, which uses some American spellings despite being based in Britain, details how it can help politicians on its website. It says: ‘When we’re working with leaders who want to communicate their messages with greater impact, it’s typically the “how” of their style that we support, improving body language, breathing, posture and prosody.’ In a section entitled ‘The Politics of Authenticity’, it adds: ‘Is learning new communication techniques just a question of artifice rather than authenticity? ‘Our answer to that question would be “yes”, if you don’t throw yourself into the learning process and practice! Any new behaviour will feel inauthentic at the beginning, and will seem so to others, too. But with repeated practice we move from “acting” to “being”.’ When Ed Miliband tried to make a conference speech off the cuff in September, he forgot to mention the deficit and was roundly ridiculed. So ever since then he has made sure he always has one trusty aide at his side ... a lectern, right. Whether he is in a town hall, a car park or a factory during the election campaign, the prop – often holding helpful notes to jog his memory – has been there for him to lean on. His advisors believe the lectern makes him look more like a prime minister-in-waiting. But its non-stop UK tour has begun to look increasingly bizarre after he even dragged it into the car park of a Leicestershire factory, where it was carefully positioned between puddles. This week he spoke from a lectern as he launched Labour campaign billboards in Nuneaton, Warwickshire ... even though he was in the middle of a cricket pitch. The website continues: ‘The anxiety we all feel to different degrees when communicating an important message to others – and which can side-swipe our message – can be erased so that our inner voice can find its way into the world.’ And in a sign that the firm could help Mr Miliband prepare to negotiate post-election deals, it notes: ‘Our intelligent networks process encourages people to think about what they want to achieve [and] identify the people who might collaborate with them to achieve those goals.’ Mr Miliband has consistently lagged behind David Cameron in polls on their personal ratings during his five years as Labour leader. But he has seen a slight boost in his popularity since the campaign began last month. After the seven-way televised leaders’ debate on ITV, it emerged that Mr Miliband had been reading from motivational notes – including one reminding him to be a ‘happy warrior’. His cribsheet, found in his dressing room after the clash, also prompted him to ‘relish the chance to show who I am’. Mr Miliband has hired ExtendedMind despite already employing David Axelrod, a former adviser to Barack Obama, on six figures. One Labour MP said Mr Axelrod had so far been ‘invisible’ in the campaign, adding: ‘I don’t understand what we are getting for the £300,000, I think it is an obscene amount.’ Mr Axelrod, who is based in the US, has insisted he is in touch with Mr Miliband ‘all the time’ by phone, text and email. Asked yesterday whether his use of ExtendedMind had been ‘helpful’, Mr Miliband told a press conference: ‘I will let other people make a judgment on those questions. I take advice from a range of people.’ A Labour spokesman said: ‘We don’t comment on people we may or may not have employed.’ ExtendedMind did not respond to a request for comment. Tory Michael Ellis said: ‘There’s nothing authentic about Ed Miliband ... even after all his extensive coaching, could you imagine him standing up to Putin on the world stage? He should ask for his money back.’
A neo-Nazi charged with killing a gay supervisor at a community college said he did so because he hates homosexuality. Stancil, who gave himself fascist face tattoos, is awaiting extradition from Florida to North Carolina, where he is accused of fatally shooting 44-year-old Ron Lane. Kenneth Morgan Stancil III, 20, told Raleigh's WRAL-TV on Wednesday that he killed Lane earlier this week in North Carolina because Lane had made sexual advances to Stancil's 16-year-old brother. Scroll down for video . Kenneth Morgan Stancil III, 20, claimed in a prison interview on Wednesday that he had killed a gay college supervisor because he made sexual advances towards his teenage brother . In a telephone interview from a Daytona Beach jail, Stancil said Lane tried to take advantage of his brother. 'He ain't physically touched him, but he was in the proposal to try to and I wasn't going to let that happen,' Stancil said. Stancil said Lane was looking for Stancil on Facebook and found his brother. A Goldsboro police spokesman did not immediately return a phone message on Thursday about that allegation. 'I'd do anything necessary to take care of my family,' Stancil said. He said he has no regrets about the shooting. 'I did what I did, and I've got to live with it. If I get life, I just get life. 'I'm a murderer, you know, what the hell do I got to care? 'I don't give a damn if I go back to society.' Stancil, shot dead his former work-study supervisor Ron Lane (pictured) and claimed to have killed three others - although police had no reports of unsolved homicides . Stancil said he is a neo-Nazi who is concerned about the future of white children. 'I try to look out for my fellow white people,' he said. 'I don't believe in race mixing.' He was asked if he hates gays. 'Yes, I do, with a passion,' he replied, though he said that was only one of the reasons he killed Lane, who had been his supervisor in a work study program at the college before he was fired for absenteeism. Stancil also told the television station he had killed three other people, including two in the Wayne County area. But the sheriff's department told the station it has no report of any unsolved homicides that match Stancil's account. The accused killer appeared in court in Florida on Tuesday where he admitted to the killing, WRAL reported, despite the judge advising him he could remain silent. He confessed to the shooting in an obscenity-laced statement, saying he 'ridded one last child molester from the Earth'. He said Lane, who had been his supervisor at the college's print shop until Stancil was fired last month, had been 'messing with' one of Stancil's family members. Lane was gay, and authorities said they are investigating a possible hate crime. They haven't released a motive for the shooting, but Stancil was dismissed from a work study program at the print shop last month. His mother, Debbie Stancil, said her son was angry over being dismissed from his work-study job for excessive absenteeism. She also said Lane made sexually laced comments to her son. 'He was verbally inappropriate with Morgan at school. Very much verbally inappropriate,' she said. 'He would tell him to stop and he kept on.' The 20-year-old is facing a charge of open murder. Stancil pictured with his mother Debbie at his graduation. She said he is 'rattled and confused and needs mental help'. The mother also claimed that the victim had made sexually laced comments to her son .
Roberto Martinez has ruled Darron Gibson out of the rest of the season after he underwent tests on his damaged metatarsal. The Everton midfielder was hurt in the 2-1 win over Queens Park Rangers last month but Martinez was hopeful that Gibson would be able to play some part in the final seven matches of the campaign. Now, though, he has been forced to admit defeat with that plan. It is a blow for the Everton manager, whose side have staged a mini-revival in recent weeks, but he insists there is positive lining in that Gibson, who missed almost all of Martinez's first campaign with cruciate ligament damage, does not require surgery. Everton midfielder Darron Gibson will not play again this season after damaging his metatarsal . Everton manager Roberto Martinez expects Gibson to return to pre-season in the best possible shape . Martinez now expects the former Manchester United midfielder to return to pre-season in the best possible shape and maintains he has a crucial role to play in Everton's future. 'I don't think we are going to see him this season,' said Martinez. 'But I am not too worried about that. It is a tricky injury because if you don't heal it properly, it could come back. We need to make sure he is 100 per cent. If he is fully fit for pre-season, that would be fantastic. 'Darron has been through a lot. We don't have another player like him in the squad. We are trying to support him. He can add that calm feeling, he has shown his worth and what he is capable of adding. But it is tough, I won't lie. It is devastating for him. 'We just have to look at the positive that he doesn't need surgery, as at one point it looked very likely.' Martinez, meanwhile, has admitted Romelu Lukaku is only '50/50' to be involved in Saturday's trip to Swansea owing to a hamstring injury. The Belgian international, whose future on Merseyside has been the subject of speculation, has only been making slow progress. Everton striker Romelu Lukaku is only '50/50' to be involved against Swansea due to a hamstring injury . We will give him as much time as we can,' said Martinez. 'It is still 50/50 as to whether he will make it. We need to make sure he is 100 per cent before we put him on the football pitch again. It is not a big problem but we do not want to take any risks with him. 'But we are very strong in terms of numbers. The squad is developing really strong competition for places. We want everyone fit and available. The squad is big enough to cope with these problems. After the demands of Europe, we have fully focused on the league. 'We have been able to cope with the mental fatigue. I do feel that we will learn and the focus is getting good momentum in the season. There are lessons to learn. We are now a more mature team. It's been a tough season and we will learn our lesson. We want to continue our momentum.'
A Russian submarine close to the coast of Britain may have dragged a trawler violently backwards after snagging in its nets, a fishermen's organisation has claimed. The Karen was towed at 10 knots during yesterday's incident 18 miles from Ardglass on the south-east shore of Northern Ireland and the vessel was badly damaged. Ardglass is one of Northern Ireland's main fishing ports and local trawlermen are usually more concerned about hitting their quotas than Cold War-style intrigue. Violently dragged: Captain Paul Murphy of the Karen, a fishing trawler, holds up a snapped steel cable aboard his boat. The damage is thought to have been caused by a Russian submarine . The incident happened off the coast of Northern Ireland and is the second time in two months that fishermen have reported being dragged by a suspected submarine (file picture) The 60-foot boat's captain Paul Murphy was pictured holding a snapped steel cable on board his boat following the alarming incident. Nato exercises were held this week in northern Scotland and Ardglass fishing representative Dick James said the alliance's drills may have attracted Russian interest. This week RAF Typhoons were launched to intercept two Russian aircraft near UK air space, the Ministry of Defence has confirmed. Mr James said: 'Our defence forces are not up to much if a rogue submarine of unidentified nationality is tearing around the Irish Sea.' Last month a trawler captain claimed his boat was nearly dragged down by a Russian submarine while fishing off the Scottish coast. The Karen was towed at 10 knots during yesterday's incident 18 miles from Ardglass on the south-east shore of Northern Ireland . Alarming episode: The Karen was towed at 10 knots during yesterday's incident and was badly damaged . The trawler's captain Paul Murphy points to an on-board computerised tracking system that shows his boat's unusual movements during the incident . Angus Macleod, 46, was fishing for haddock and skate when he became convinced that a hostile vessel was caught up below his boat Aquarius. The submarine attempted to free itself, taking the 65ft vessel and his two-ton catch with it. Recently Russian warships reportedly used the English Channel en route to military exercises in the North Atlantic. The coastguard said the Karen reported a collision at a point known as the Calf of Man not far from the Isle of Man. The skipper said the boat had been snagged and dragged backwards at speed. Mr James added: 'You don't need to go long at that until you go under.' The four crew members scrambled to release wires connecting the net to the out-of-control trawler, which had been moving slowly forward but was suddenly sent careering backwards through the water. As the ship steadied the shaken seamen stopped to catch their breath but there was no sign of the cause. The vessel made its way back to Ardglass and part of the deck had to be lifted because it was so badly damaged, and another section was ripped off. Mr James added: 'It is a bl***y mess.' He said Royal Navy protocols mean an incident like this would not happen involving a British submarine. He said: 'It is possible that it was a Russian submarine. Another recent alert: This week RAF Typhoons were launched to intercept two Russian aircraft, believed to be 'Bear' bombers, (stock image) near UK air space . No explanation: Experts said Russian President Vladimir Putin's move to send planes capable of carrying cruise missiles so close to British shores could be seen as an act of aggression . 'You cannot always prevent it but if an incident like this did happen the (Royal Navy) protocols said that the submarine would immediately surface to check on the health and welfare of the people involved and this one did not. 'Paul Murphy, the skipper, said that he sat for five to 10 minutes catching his breath to see if the submarine would surface. 'It was a submarine, it had to be, it could not have been anything else.' The incident came as Britain hosted a Nato exercise in northern Scotland involving more than 50 warships. Separately, the MoD has said RAF Typhoons, from RAF Lossiemouth, were deployed 'after Russian aircraft were identified flying close to UK air space'. It said it could not comment on Royal Navy submarine movements or the fishing vessel incident. Tensions over the Ukraine conflict have soured relations between the West and Russia, which is suffering from US and EU sanctions imposed because the Kremlin is backing separatists in eastern Ukraine. A map showing how jets were launched from RAF Lossiemouth on Monday, shortly after HMS Argyll was deployed to monitor a Russian destroyer and two other ships as they passed through the English Channel . Mr James, chief executive of the Northern Ireland Fish Producers' Organisation, said: 'There has been Russian activity. There have been Allied exercises going on, the Russians have been taking an interest in it. 'The question mark now is what kind of a submarine was it? 'If it was Allied it should have been following an agreed protocol where this should not have happened.' Sinn Fein Northern Ireland Assembly member Chris Hazzard said the community was angry. He said: 'The fact that this submarine didn't even surface to make sure the fishermen were safe has caused considerable resentment in the area. It is totally unacceptable that a submarine would show such contempt for maritime workers. 'The skipper and his crew on the Karen, and indeed all of the local fleet, deserve to know the truth about what happened. 'Whether this is a British vessel attached to the hugely controversial Trident system or a Nato submarine in training, our local fishermen deserve justice.'
The baby boom generation is set to leave one last burden to its children and grandchildren – a wave of funeral debt. The cost of paying for rising numbers of deaths as the unprecedented numbers of post-World War Two babies come to the end of their lives may be too much for many families, a report said. It predicted that numbers of deaths in Britain, which have been falling for 40 years, will start to go up and increase by 20 per cent over the next two decades. At the same time the price of a funeral is rising fast, thanks to higher costs for cremation, rising undertakers’ bills as funeral firms are faced with bad debts, and the increasing fees demanded by churches. Deaths in Britain, which have been falling for 40 years, will start to go up and increase by 20 per cent over the next two decades, a report by a think tank has found (file photo) The report, prepared by an old age think tank, the International Longevity Centre-UK, and backed by insurance firm OneFamily, suggests that younger people who already feel financially hard pressed in comparison to their parents will still be under money pressure even after their deaths. Younger people are finding it increasingly difficult to afford homes or to start families, and in the long-term their pensions are much less secure than those of their parents, many of whom enjoyed the generous and fast-disappearing defined benefit pension system. The report from ILC-UK to be published next week said that death rates are set to go up following a long period in which medical advances, better diet, healthier lifestyles and the growing unpopularity of smoking, and the decline of dangerous heavy industrial jobs, have meant fewer people have been dying despite a rising population. ‘After decades of the number of deaths in the UK falling, 2015 will mark a tipping point where the historic trend starts to reverse,’ it said. ‘As the oldest of the baby boomer generation move through their later years, deaths are predicted to rise by 20 per cent.’ It added: ‘This will have significant implications for current forecasts of funeral costs and highlights a growing need for families to broach the delicate subject of end of life expenses.’ A 'simple' funeral with a cremation, a minister and an undertaker now costs £3, 590 . Baroness Sally Greengross of ILC-UK said: ‘More than half of UK households have less than £3,000 in savings and many will struggle to cover funeral costs. ‘We all need to talk more about dying and ensure we are prepared for the inevitable. State support for funerals is complex and inadequate and without reforms will contribute to more people falling victim to funeral debt.’ The report said that funeral costs have already risen by 80 per cent over the past 10 years and costs are set to go up further. A ‘simple’ funeral, with a cremation, a minister and an undertaker, now costs an average of £3,590, it found. However a family that wants to throw in a memorial stone, death notices, flowers, limousines, a wake and somewhere to hold it, is likely to be looking at spending almost £2,000 more. An average ‘full works’ funeral now costs £5,423, the report said. Costs are going up, it found, partly for technical reasons. Crematoria now need to cover costs for removing fillings from the teeth of the dead, for example, because they must remove mercury from the body before disposal. Funeral firms are under growing costs pressures, not least because some families cannot or will not pay their bills, and the fees for a Church of England vicar to conduct the funeral went up in 2013 from £102 to £160. More than one in five families do not have money left by the deceased to help with the cost of the funeral, the report said.
Lucas Leiva would like to remind people it is not just Steven Gerrard playing out his own emotional journey in Sunday's FA Cup semi-final against Aston Villa at Wembley. The Brazilian has been at Anfield for eight years and holds the unwanted record of playing more games for Liverpool without winning a major trophy than anyone else in 50 years. He missed the 2012 League Cup final and two other Wembley appearances that year with a serious knee injury sustained against Chelsea the previous November. His story might not have the celebrity appeal of Gerrard saying goodbye in an FA Cup final on his 35th birthday, but the desire to win the Cup is just as strong. Lucas has been the longest-serving player at Liverpool behind captain Steven Gerrard (right) Lucas has played more games for Liverpool without winning a major trophy than anyone else in 50 years . ‘I’ve played at the Maracana a few times but never at Wembley,’ said Lucas, 28. ‘I have been dreaming about it, to be honest. I’ve been at Liverpool so long. Gerrard deserves to win the FA Cup after what he has done for this club. He has won many trophies here but a lot of people here have been working for many years and not won as much as him. We want to win like him.’ When Lucas was signed by Rafa Benitez in 2007, Liverpool had just been in their second Champions League final in three seasons. But he has had to endure turbulent times since then; four managers and a change of ownership that dragged Liverpool into virtual civil war. Not surprisingly, the cup finals and trophies dried up. ‘I didn’t think I was going to stay this long. I felt after the first season I was gone,’ said Lucas with a laugh, having been pilloried by the Kop during his early days. ‘There have been big changes in the club during my time here and at some point you pay a price for that. Sunday will mark Steven Gerrard’s 36th, and possibly last, appearance at Wembley. Thirty-two of his games have been there for England (including one at the old Wembley) and three for Liverpool. Wembley record for England P32 W24 D4 L4 Goals 8 . Wembley record for Liverpool P3 W1 D1 L1 Goals 0 . Three Wembley highlights . England 2-0 Ukraine - 2000 . Makes his England debut at the old Wembley the day after his 20th birthday and impresses enough to earn a place in Kevin Keegan’s Euro 2000 squad. Plays for 81 minutes before replaced by Kieron Dyer. England 2-0 USA - 2008 . Scores his first goal at the new national stadium when he sidefoots Gareth Barry’s pass past American goalkeeper Brad Guzan. Liverpool 2-1 Everton- 2012 . Having lifted the League Cup earlier in the season, Gerrard returned to Wembley for a sweet FA Cup semi-final victory against their Merseyside rivals, with Andy Carroll heading a late winner. ‘There was discussion about ownership, the court and all that. It didn’t help. We saw a lot of senior players leaving. This is a chance for our new team to win their first trophy.’ Lucas has gone from an impressionable youngster learning from Gerrard, Pepe Reina and Xabi Alonso to one of the senior voices in the dressing room. He has seen youngsters Raheem Sterling and Jordon Ibe criticised for being photographed with a shisha pipe and said: ‘It is hard to give advice because there are so many people always around players. I just think young players shouldn’t get carried away. I had real role models in the dressing room like Pepe and Stevie. You saw they had success because of the way they do things, not just their talent. ‘Ten years ago, players would have more space. Today we go to a restaurant and everyone is filming, recording or taking pictures. You need to have extra care. If you are having a glass of wine, then people say you are drunk.’ Lucas tries to win a tackle during Liverpool's 2-0 victory at home to Newcastle on Monday night . Lucas celebrates Joe Allen's (right) second goal for Liverpool against Newcastle . Lucas is desperate to win the FA Cup and end his 270-game barren spell at Anfield. The last player to have played more times for Liverpool without winning a major trophy was Alan O’Court who played for the club 345 times between 1952 and 1964, collecting just a Second Division championship medal. Liverpool felt so sorry for Lucas, who was injured for the 2012 League Cup final win, they asked the Football League to send him a medal in the post. Liverpool’s improvements under Rodgers have not so far translated into silverware. They finished second to Manchester City in a thrilling Premier League title race last season and were beaten by eventual winners Chelsea in this year’s Capital One Cup semi-finals. Brendan Rodgers knows, with a far stronger squad than he inherited in 2012, they now have to take the cup competitions seriously. ‘For me, the objective in the first couple of years was getting into the Champions League,’ he said. ‘If you look at how we did in the cups we weren’t so good. I felt we didn’t have the squad to challenge. This year we’d arrived into the Champions League and could focus on winning a trophy. We have got to one semi-final already in the Capital One Cup and now we’ve got another chance. Our vision is to win trophies.’ Gerrard has returned to the squad after a three-match ban from being sent off against Manchester United . Gerrard (right) made his Wembley debut for England in 2000 in a friendly against Ukraine . The return of Gerrard into the squad after a three-match ban for stamping on Manchester United’s Ander Herrera is vital to calm any nerves. In contrast to Lucas and others in the Liverpool team, he has played at Wembley 35 times in his career — and been on the winning side in 25 of them. Rodgers smiles that he will be ‘heartless’ in deciding whether to name his captain in the starting XI but is adamant Gerrard will make a big contribution. ‘I’ve had a meal with him, talking over things,’ said the manager. ‘I am disappointed I didn’t have the chance to work with him for longer. At 24, I would have built a team around him like I did with Luis Suarez. ‘Wembley is like his second home. He knows what it takes to win there. He’s calm anyway before the games and that is important for us as a team. Everyone respects that I want to do what is best for the team. Status and star quality have never bothered me, really.’
A seller on eBay has claimed that he has former New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez's jailhouse identification card - and he's trying to auction it off. The eBay listing, posted Friday, showed a laminated badge featuring a photo of Hernandez, 25, and identifying information, including his height, weight and birth date. Hernandez is currently in prison during his trial for the the June 2013 shooting death of Odin Lloyd, who was dating his fiancée's sister. Lloyd was shot six times in an industrial park less than a mile from Hernandez's home. Scroll down for video . An eBay user posted what appears to be laminated badge that featured a photo of former New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez and identifying information about the 25-year-old . The listing on eBay claimed that it was selling Hernandez's Suffolk County jail ID card, according to CBS Boston. 'I was in jail with Aaron Hernandez the for patriot super star.. I happen to com across his jail id (sic),' the user posted. The starting price for the card was $500, though there were no bids on the item when the auction was removed from the site on Saturday. It is unclear whether the user or eBay staff removed the auction item from the site. The listing, which was deleted on Saturday and had zero bids, was posted by a user who claimed he was in jail with Hernandez . Jurors in Hernandez's trial deliberated for nearly 20 hours over the last week considering whether to convict the former football player. They return to court on Monday. In addition to the murder charge, they must decide whether to convict him on charges of illegal possession of a firearm and ammunition. Two friends of Hernandez, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, are also charged with murder and will be tried separately. Hernandez is currently in prison during his trial for the the June 2013 shooting death of Odin Lloyd, who was dating his fiancée's sister . Prosecutors contend that the three men, in the early hours of June 17, 2013, picked Lloyd up at his home in Boston and drove him to the industrial park where his body was found riddled with bullets later that day. During the trial, which began in January and featured more than 130 witnesses, prosecutors showed video footage of Hernandez coming and going from his home around the time of Lloyd's death. Investigators did not recover the gun that was used to shoot Lloyd, a .45-caliber Glock pistol. Hernandez faces a charge of murder and two firearms-related violations. If convicted of first-degree murder, he would be sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. A second-degree murder conviction would lead to a life sentence with the possibility of parole after 15 years. Hernandez had been a rising star in the National Football League with a $41million contract when he was arrested on June 26, 2013. The Patriots dropped him within hours.
Covered entirely in crystals, it may not be to everybody's taste - but a new £420,000 piano is possibly the most bling musical instrument in the world. The custom-made piano features half a million Swarovski crystals and was created following a request from an unnamed buyer described as an 'influential Sheikh' in Doha, Qatar. Goldfinch, a Cambridge-based piano maker, took six months to build it, with every crystal applied by hand. Scroll down for video . A £420,000 piano has been hand decorated with half a million Swarovski crystals . Company director Tomas Norman, whose family has been handcrafting high-end pianos for more than 40 years, said: 'It's been a delight to bring another customer's dream to reality. 'We love nothing more than blurring the lines between timeless tradition and contemporary British art, but it's not all about good looks - our craftsmanship is combined with cutting-edge technology for that seamless finish and ultimate musicality.' He claimed the company is the only piano manufacturer in the world which offers an almost limitless selection of shapes, sizes, colours, materials and textures. The piano was made in collaboration with British contemporary artist Lauren Baker. The sparkling piano was created for an 'influential Sheikh' in Doha, Qatar . When the light hits the crystals they shine in different colours . Previous projects have included a piano colour-matched to an RAF fighter plane and a baby grand piano that appears to melt down three flights of stairs. The company typically produces pianos priced between £100,000 and £1 million and has shipped instruments to Hong Kong, Dubai and Los Angeles in the past. Artist Lauren Baker added the half a million crystals by hand saying she has an obsession with working with the shining gem stones . Lauren said her work: 'I'm really drawn to working with crystals. My imagination runs wild with ideas. 'I've got an obsession and a fascination with crystals so this is the perfect project. It's every little detail that counts. 'It's the meticulous minute detail of the pieces that form the beautiful final outcome. It's all about the way the crystals catch the light and refract into a prism of colours. That makes it so extravagant.' Even the name of the piano was done in crystals, placed on with tweezers . Goldfinch regularly make custom pianos which range between £100,000 and £1million .
Frankie Dettori made it six winners in four days as well as three flying dismounts with a treble at Newbury on Saturday centred around a neck success on Charlie Hills-trained Greenham Stakes winner Muhaarar. Spring has sprung this week and Dettori has been bouncing higher than Tigger. In this sort of form, those who suggested his best days were well behind him will have to eat their words. Frankie Dettori leaps from his mount  after riding Muhaarar to win The AON Greenham Stakes at Newbury . Dettori rides Mr Singh to win The Al Basti Equiworld Maiden Stakes at Newbury racecourse . Thursday’s announcement that Dettori’s boss Sheik Joaan Al Thani had signed up Gregory Benoist to ride the French-based horses in his expanding string, means the 44-year-old Italian can concentrate on Britain. That means less tiring criss-crossing of the Channel for Dettori as well as having another positive spin-off – being available for rides going spare with old boss John Gosden after winter staffing rehuffles. So far, Dettori has been mopping them up. Three of the jockey’s winners – Derby prospect Golden Horn, who won the Feilden Stakes at Newmarket, Oaks candidate Star of Seville, who scored at Newbury on Friday, plus maiden winner Mr Singh on Saturday were all prepared for action by Gosden. Dettori said: ‘The Greenham was good. They went very fast and Muhaarar is a horse that needs to settle. He did and produced. ‘I don’t think I have had thee flying dismounts before so early. I have had a fantastic week. It is brilliant and being back at John’s – I have gone full circle. I am back to where I started.’ Dettori riding Muhaarar to victory in the The AON Greenham Stakes at Newbury on Saturday . Dettori had spoken of his enthusiasm for the season ahead when unveiled as the new ambassador for his home course Newmarket last week. He showed that on tricky Ayaar, 7-1 Luca Cumani-trained winner of Newbury’s Spring Cup. He now has nine winners from 29 rides, not sound seismic but it is significant compared to the last two seasons. The 2014 campaign had only 37 successes and, a truncated 2013 season when he returned from the doldrums of splitting from Godolphin and a six-month cocaine ban had him walking around like yesterday’s man. Dettori riding Ayaar win The Be Wiser Insurance Spring Cup at Newbury racecourse on Saturday . He is no longer champion jockey material but he does look to have significant better chances of good rides in quality races. His 1,000 Guineas ride will be Richard Hannon-trained Nell Gwyn Stakes winner Osaila, who runs for Sheik Joaan, while he must pick from Hannon-trained Craven Stakes third Moheet and John Quinn’s Group One winning two-year-old The Wow Factor in the 2,000. Hannon has insisted both Greenham Stakes second and third Istidhkaar and Ivawood will join his Craven Stakes winner Kool Kompany in the 2,000 Guineas. He also might still run Tiggy Wiggy, runner-up to Ralph Beckett’s Redstart in the Fred Darling Stakes Saturday, in the 1,000 Guineas. But after a disappointing show, some bookmakers have taken her out of the ante-post betting.
Last week she was barely showing – but Demelza Poldark is now the proud mother to the show’s latest addition. Within ten minutes of tomorrow night’s episode, fans will see Aidan Turner’s dashing Ross Poldark gaze lovingly at his new baby daughter. As Sunday night’s latest heartthrob, women across the country have voiced their longing to settle down with the brooding Cornish gentleman – but unfortunately it seems as if his heart is well and truly off the market. Scroll down for video . Last week she was barely showing – but Demelza Poldark is now the proud mother to the show’s latest addition . He may have married his red-headed kitchen maid out of duty, but as he tells her that she makes him a better man, audiences can have little doubt about his feelings. What is rather less convincing, however, is the timeline of the pregnancy. With the climax of the previous episode being the announcement of the pregnancy, it is quite a jump to the start of tomorrow’s instalment where Demelza, played by Eleanor Tomlinson, talks about being eight months pregnant. Just minutes after – once again without any nod to the passing of time – she is giving birth, with the last month of her pregnancy passing in less than the blink of an eye. With the climax of the previous episode being the announcement of the pregnancy, it is quite a jump to the start of tomorrow’s instalment where Demelza, played by Eleanor Tomlinson, talks about being eight months pregnant . As Sunday night’s latest heartthrob, women across the country have voiced their longing to settle down with Poldark – but unfortunately it seems as if his heart is well and truly off the market . Their fast relationship didn't go unnoticed by fans. One posted on Twitter: ‘If you are pregnant in Poldark times expect to have it in the next 10 minutes’ It is reminiscent of the show’s previous pregnancy that saw Elizabeth, another contender for Ross’s affection, go to full term in the gap between two episodes. This didn’t go unnoticed by fans, who posted on Twitter: ‘Poldark is rather good, would watch the next one now. Though if you are pregnant in Poldark times expect to have it in the next 10 minutes.’
A Nevada woman received a $200 ticket after she was pulled over for putting on makeup while she was behind the wheel as part of a statewide crackdown on distracted drivers. So what sort of beauty product was she applying while stopped at a red light?  Lip balm. Stephanie Fragoso was cited on Wednesday, April Fools' Day, after she was stopped in Las Vegas by a Nevada Highway Patrol (NHP) trooper. Scroll down for video . Stephanie Fragoso was cited on Wednesday, April Fools' Day, after she was stopped by in Las Vegas, Nevada . A Nevada Highway Patrol trooper issued a $200 ticket to Fragoso for putting on lib balm while at a red light . The state released distracted driving statistics as part of its campaign to have zero driving fatalities in 2015 . Fragoso said she initially thought the whole thing was a joke, but figured out it was no laughing matter after she was issued the $200 citation, 8 News NOW reported. She said: 'I told him it was ChapStick. 'He said, ''It could have been anything; you could have been drinking water, shaving your legs.''' The ticket caused Fragoso to receive points against her driving record. The crackdown is part of a campaign for the state to have zero driving fatalities in 2015, CBS Las Vegas reported. Distracted driving fines range from $50 for the first offense up to $250 and a six-month license suspension . NHP trooper Loy Hixson said: 'We have zero tolerance for distracted drivers. 'They put themselves and everyone else who uses our valley roadways at risk of serious injury or even death. 'Nevada's goal is and always will be zero fatalities.' Distracted driving fines range from $50 for the first offense up to $250 and a six-month license suspension for subsequent offenses within a seven-year period. Penalties may be increased if the alleged violation occurs in a work zone. Trooper Hixson added: 'I have seen men shaving with their electric razors. 'One time, when I was driving down US 95, I saw a lady watching a movie on her iPad and the iPad was attached to her steering wheel with Velcro.'
It is not a match to decide the title, as has been the case in earlier seasons. But the Manchester derby this Sunday still holds great significance for both clubs, managers and, of course, supporters. City have won the last four contests between the sides, as well as the previous three at Old Trafford. A number of intriguing strands run through this coming clash and could be pulled apart on full time. Here Sportsmail assesses ten key questions and tries to provide some answers. Can Manuel Pellegrini survive a derby loss? The word is the Chilean’s future will be decided come May when the dust on a creaking season has settled. Defeat to cross-town rivals would push chairman Khaldoon al Mubarak closer to pressing the termination button though. It would leave City trailing United by four points and likely to finish fourth, needing to get past a qualifying round to reach to Champions League – the very minimum requirement. Manuel Pellegrini (centre) is a man under-pressure at City and a defeat to their rivals is unthinkable . Who needs the win more? To that end you would probably have to say City. A victory would inject some happiness into what seems a rather glum situation, and reignite ambitions to finish second, possible saving Pellegrini from the axe. United look set to finish in the top four regardless, the baseline attainment for this campaign to be judged satisfactory. But they will be desperate to alter that current ugly sequence against their noisy neighbours. United have never lost five in a row to City before. Three points would begin to make their season look very decent indeed. Glenn Murray (right) tormented City at Selhurst Park as they dropped out of the Premier League title race . Would victory dispel any lingering doubts about Louis Van Gaal? Quite likely. Three successive wins on the bounce against opposition the stature of Tottenham, Liverpool and City would underline Van Gaal’s ability to rise to the big matches and suggest that, after a season of trial, error, and turnstile selections, the plan is coming together. Those uncertainties around the Dutchman would resurface just as swiftly with defeat of course. Louis van Gaal has had his critics this season but Manchester United's performances are proving them wrong . Should Vincent Kompany remain in the City side? It would be a big call for a game of such size, but the sense that City may be better off without their captain cannot be disregarded. These should be the 29-year-old’s peak years but injuries seem to have affected his body and mind. The Belgian is increasingly prone to errors of judgement. Martin Demichelis and Eliaquim Mangala do not provide the most robust competition but Kompany’s appearance in seven losses in 12 games speaks volumes. Mangala, on the bench against Crystal Palace, has experienced three losses in 24 matches all season. Vincent Kompany (left) has struggled for form this campaign and could lose his place for the derby . Where does this rank in English football’s biggest games? Manchester has become a powerhouse of English football through City’s ascent. The city has been home to the Premier League title for the past four seasons, oscillating between Old Trafford and the Etihad. That will not be the case this year but the rivalry still burns and allied to the global scale of these clubs the match ranks as high as any other, perhaps only beaten by Liverpool-United. Mario Balotelli (centre) produced one of the most iconic derby moments when he scored at Old Trafford . Who is the better player right now: Wayne Rooney or Sergio Aguero? No doubt Aguero is the better striker, his movement, angles for shooting, and goal-scoring record stands testament to that. But since being shifted to his preferred centre-forward role, Rooney is displaying form that would see him into any side. He has been approaching his all-action peak and scored seven goals in ten games for club and country, taking his overall season tally to 21. Aguero has 23 for the campaign, but has failed to find the net in his last six games, a run stretching back to February 24. At the moment you would have to go for Rooney. These two love the Manchester derby. Rooney holds the record for most all-time goals with 11, while Aguero has six in seven. Wayne Rooney (left) and Sergio Aguero are two of the best forwards in the current Premier League . How crucial might Michael Carrick be? His return to the United lineup in the fulcrum role in front of defence has lifted the side considerably. He has not enjoyed the best returns facing City in recent seasons – and in the corresponding fixture was asked to play centre-back as a first-half substitute – but will get more space in his deeper midfield role. It is unlikely Pellegrini will task anyone with marshalling Carrick, which is how he likes it. Michael Carrick (left) has become a key player for United over the years and is pivotal for Van Gaal . Will the real Yaya Toure show up? You would hope so. Yaya at the height of his powers in an awesome sight and could prove the difference. But those flashes have been all too fleeting this season. Now would be a good time to step up. Like Kompany, Yaya Toure's form is patchy but he scored a stunning goal against Crystal Palace on Monday . Will United solve the problem of Angel di Maria? The team looks balanced right now, with Ashley Young doing nothing to lose his place. United’s record signing has been coming on and providing assists, so Van Gaal is probably inclined to repeat the pattern. Ultimately, Di Maria must provide more, and will want to, but at this moment he should start on the bench. Why is kick-off at 4pm? Police saw no dangers of the late afternoon kick-off time on a Sunday, and have cited previous good behaviour between sets of supporters. As ever, television dictates the preference and the 4pm slot is prime for viewers. Angel di Maria hasn't quite settled in Manchester but recently has done well when coming off the bench .
One of Diego Simeone’s many managerial mantras – and there are already enough to fill a volume that would rival Louis van Gaal’s Biographie & Vision – is: ‘I always think that tomorrow I could be sacked’. It perfectly illustrates his work ethic and his obsession with guarding against complacency but even he must know that right now no-one is further from the chop than the 44-year-old coach who took Atletico Madrid to the title last season and leads them into the Champions League quarter-final against Real Madrid on Tuesday night. There was a communal sigh let-out across several boardrooms of top European football clubs two weeks ago when he put pen to paper on a new deal that ties him to the club until 2019. Diego Simeone shows off his playing skills as he prepare Atletico Madrid for their Champions League clash . Simeone talks to his squad ahead of Real Madrid's visit on Tuesday night in the quarter final first leg . Sporting directors from Manchester to Milan were watching his situation carefully and the new four year contract with the option of a fifth season appears to have ended his chances of arriving in Italy or England this summer. Back home in Madrid the Atletico supporters were delirious at the news. Never mind that last year’s title will not be repeated this season. The fans have long enough memories to remember how bad things were back in December 2011, before his appointment. Current Chelsea striker Diego Costa would also remember that period well. He was just about to return from a cruciate ligament injury that had sidelined him for three months. The Argentinian manager has imposed his incredible work ethic on his players since joining Atletico . Simeone has turned Atletico around since joining in December 2011, and recently extended his deal . His Atletico Madrid team-mates were stagnating under coach Gregorio Manzano and had just been knocked out of the Cup by a third division side, Albacete. Costa had previously been out on loan at Albacete and had the good grace to go into their dressing-room after the game and congratulate his former team-mates on their giantkilling scalp. Back in his own dressing room the mood was bleak. The team were closer to the relegation zone than the European places and Manzano was soon sacked and replaced by Simeone. Sceptics said his inexperience as a coach in Europe would prevent him succeeding. Romantics said the former captain and double winner at Atletico would bring back the glory days. The romantics were right. Without Costa, who was at first loaned out to Rayo Vallecano, Simeone’s Atletico won the Europa League and the European Super Cup. Costa returned to help them win the Copa del Rey and the league as well as making last season’s Champions League final. That final in Lisbon seemed to put Real back on top in the Spanish capital but Simeone’s noisy neighbours have refused to pipe-down. In the six subsequent matches between the two sides they have not let Real win a single game. In the two-legged Spanish Super Cup at the start of the season Atletico drew 1-1 in the Bernabeu and beat Real 1-0 in the Calderon. They then went to the Bernabeu in the league and won 2-1. Saul scores a brilliant bicycle kick during the 4-0 win over Real at the Vicente Calderon earlier this season . Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale were unable to do anything to prevent Atletico's dominance in February . And when the two teams were drawn against each other in the Copa del Rey Atletico won the first leg 2-0 and then drew the second. Worse was to come for Real Madrid in the League in February when they lost the away fixture 4-0. This season Atletico Madrid are not going to win the league but no one is ruling out another tilt at the prize they were seconds from winning last season – leading from Diego Godin’s goal until the last minute when Sergio Ramos scored to take the match to extra time. Atletico players had told anyone who would listen throughout last season that while they didn’t give themselves much of a chance in La Liga up against the stronger squads of Real Madrid and Barcelona, they did fancy themselves in the Champions League – ‘we can beat anyone over two legs’ was the message and that still stands. They showed tremendous resilience to come through against Bayer Leverkusen in the last round with Fernando Torres scoring the last penalty of the shoot-out. Ronaldo scored the fourth goal in Real Madrid's win over their rivals in last year's Champions League final . Simeone's players watch on after losing out in Lisbon, but are determined to bounce back this year . He put through his own net at the weekend in the league typifying that faltering league form and will probably make way for Mario Mandzukic Tuesday. The battering-ram bought from Bayern in the summer to replace Costa has not always met Simeone’s demands for constant pressing of the opposition’s defence this season. After a fall-out with Simone, who in one recent match was visibly furious with his striker, a fragile truce has been called although the likes of PSG’s Edinson Cavani and Villarreal’s Luciano Vietto are being looked at as replacements for next season. Mandzukic told his manager recently that he had regularly played through injury and wanted resting. He was obliged, and now looks set to be brought back in to face Pepe and Sergio Ramos. Former Bayern Munich striker Mario Mandzukic (behind) is set to start alongside Antoine Griezmann . Mandzukic has patched up his relationship with Simeone and will play ahead of Fernando Torres on Tuesday . Tuesday night may well be as much about keeping a clean sheet as scoring. Ronaldo returns the scene of Madrid’s biggest crime this season – that 4-0 defeat in the league on the day he celebrated his 30th birthday. Sometimes in training Simeone likes to play a very special game of attack against defence. He lines up a first team back seven against 14 youth teamers. He’s proud of the first-team defences’ ability to keep the ball out of their goal despite being outnumbered two to one. Whether 14 youth team players amounts to more or less than Gareth Bale, Ronaldo and Karim Benzema is open to debate. But then again those three were all on the pitch back in February for the 4-0 Atletico win and they never got anywhere near a goal. Tuesday night is a chance for Real Madrid to avenge that defeat, but it’ s also another chance for Simeone to show once again that in the Spanish capital he is the boss.
Kitted out: Mr Carney out running in Hyde Park . Just how many water bottles does a man need when running? If you’re the governor of the Bank of England, the answer seems to be four. Mark Carney was spotted on a day off from helping to run the economy jogging in London’s Hyde Park sporting a high-tech running belt with no fewer than four water bottles. The keen runner, who training for the London Marathon later this month, was wearing a Nathan Speed 4 Fuel Belt, which also features a zip pocket perfect for storing high-carb energy gel packs. The belt is available for $64.95 (£35) at Kintec, a Canadian sports retailer based in Vancouver, suggesting Mr Carney, originally from Canada, bought it before he moved to the UK. He was also wearing headphones and top-of-the range running shoes. His adidas Energy Boost ESM Shoes, in green and black, cost £120. According to the manufacturer, ‘more boost beneath your feet means more fuel in your tank’. They feature a ‘form-fitting techfit® upper’ which is ‘engineered for natural, flexible support and a seamless, sock-like fit’, the firm’s website states. Mr Carney, in charge of the world’s sixth largest economy, completed his look with a grey jumper, which was drenched in sweat by the end of his training session. The father of four daughters, who turned 50 last week, is known to be a keen sportsman and likes to keep fit. At Harvard, he played in goal for his ice hockey team. In 2011, he completed in Canada’s Ottawa marathon, finishing the 26.2-mile sprint in just three hours and 48 minutes in 2011 – an hour and 40 minutes shy of the winning time that year. He continued running when he moved to London to become the Bank of England chief in 2013, and is known to sometimes run from his home to Bank’s headquarters in the City of London to avoid the traffic. ‘Like many other Londoners I do run to work or home from work from time to time,’ he said in an interview. He will be running the London Marathon in aid of Cancer Research UK, a Bank of England spokesman announced in January.

At the start of the year the prospect of Manchester United leading rivals Manchester City going into April's derby at Old Trafford looked extremely unlikely. But Louis van Gaal's side have hit form at the right time, while the current Premier League champions seem to have blown their chances of retaining their title after crushing defeats at Burnley and Crystal Palace. Since City beat United 1-0 last November, plenty of players have improved, some have faded, while both Van Gaal and Manuel Pellegrini have tinkered with their systems. Here, Sportsmail looks at how a composite XI of the sides might take shape, choosing the 4-2-3-1 formation both teams seem to favour. The Manchester United and Manchester City composite Xi ahead of the derby - selected by Sportsmail . Louis van Gaal (l) and Manuel Pellegrini's (r) sides are in contrasting form going into the Old Trafford clash . Goalkeeper - David de Gea . Just gets the gloves ahead of Joe Hart. A very close call, especially given the Englishman's form over recent weeks, but the athletic Spaniard edges it. David de Gea edges out Joe Hart for the goalkeeper slot and has been in fine form at Old Trafford this season . Right back - Pablo Zabaleta . Form has been patchy this term but is the best right back either club can boast. Manuel Pellegrini may opt for the more defensive Bacary Sagna, but he should not do so if only so we can see Zabaleta renew acquaintances with Marouane Fellaini, who elbowed him in the face last season. Pablo Zabaleta hasn't been at his best but is the best right back either club can boast at the moment . Centre back - Vincent Kompany . Like Zabaleta, not had the best of seasons but remains far above anything United currently have at centre-half. Should be coming into his best years but appears to be going backwards. That said, would be some dip in form to see him miss the cut. Vincent Kompany - pictured looking dejected after the defeat by Crrytal Palace - is still the No 1 choice . Centre back - Chris Smalling . Impressive in recent weeks before illness, keeping the likes of Harry Kane and Daniel Sturridge quiet. Deserves his chance to rectify his derby disaster, when he was red-carded at the Etihad in November. Chris Smalling was sent off in the last Manchester Derby in November and will be looking to make amends . Left Back - Gael Clichy . Both clubs may strengthen at left back in the summer although United will want more from Luke Shaw. Clichy has done well to keep out Aleksandar Kolarov for long periods and is a better left back than Daley Blind, despite the versatile Dutchman's sterling performances there recently. Both United and City will be looking to strengthen at left back this summer but for now Gael Clichy is best fit . Sport analysts BSports are predicting Manchester City are likely to win the derby at Old Trafford . Centre midfield - Michael Carrick . Finally getting the recognition he deserves outside of Old Trafford. At 33 he is excelling at the back of midfield in a quarterback role and has been at the heart of United's revival. Michael Carrick has been at the heart of Man United's revival - playing in a quarterback position in midfield . Centre midfield - Ander Herrera . United's man-of-the-moment finally appears to be on the right side of Van Gaal after a sluggish start. The box-to-box Spaniard is evidence of the Dutchman's claims that given time to adapt to his methods, his players will succeed. Ander Herrera is Louis van Gaal's man of the moment and seems to be flourishing in the manager's system . Attacking midfield - Juan Mata . March's player of the month is another to flourish after a sluggish opening. His two goals at Liverpool and understanding with Ander Herrera have helped United launch what looked for a long time like an unlikely assault on second place. Juan Mata has a fine understanding with Herrera and scored this stunning goal against Liverpool last month . Attacking midfield - David Silva . Arguably City's greatest player of all time, the nimble-footed magician drifts effortlessly into the side. Has remained superb despite the slump and continues to create chances for his suddenly-wasteful team-mates. David Silva has remained superb despite City's slum and continues to create chances for his team-mates . Attacking midfield - Wayne Rooney . The Scouser who loves the Manchester derby. Has scored 11 times against City and has more goals than anyone else in the long history of this fixture. Wayne Rooney has scored more goals than anyone in the Manchester Derby and is in good form up front . Striker - Sergio Aguero . Another underperformer who should be doing better for City, the Argentine has not scored in his last six matches. That said, few would bet against him ending that run on enemy territory. Sergio Aguero is another City underperformer but could end his six-game run without a goal against United . PLAYER TALLY . MANCHESTER UNITED - 6 . MANCHESTER CITY - 5 .
Born-again Christian Victoria Wasteney has launched an appeal after she was given a written warning for praying for a Muslim colleague and inviting her to church events . A devout Christian has launched an appeal against an employment tribunal which found she had ‘bullied’ a Muslim colleague by praying for her and inviting her to church. Victoria Wasteney, 38, says she was branded a ‘religious nutcase’  when she was suspended from her job as a senior occupational therapist, after her colleague Enya Nawaz, then aged 25, accused her of trying to convert her to Christianity. Her lawyers have now submitted a challenge to an employment tribunal, arguing that they broke the law by restricting her freedom of conscience and religion - enshrined in article nine of the European Convention of Human Rights. Miss Wasteney, a born-again Christian, was working at the St John Howard Centre in Homerton, east London, when she became friendly with a junior colleague Miss Nawaz. The two women had discussed Islam and Christianity, as well as the work done by her church at the Christian Revival Church in the O2 Arena in Greenwich against human trafficking. When Miss Nawaz was upset about health problems, Miss Wasteney said she offered to pray for her – putting her hand on her knee and asking God for ‘peace and healing’. She also invited her to church events and gave her colleague a book, I Dared To Call Him Father, about a Muslim woman who converts to Christianity, but denied she was trying to make Miss Nawaz convert. Miss Nawaz went onto make a formal complaint, and the East London NHS Foundation Trust suspended Ms Wasteney on full pay from her £50,000-a-year job for nine months while they investigated in June 2013. A disciplinary hearing upheld three complaints about the book, the invitation to attend church and Miss Wasteney’s offer to pray for Miss Nawaz, and gave her a written warning for misconduct. She continues to work for the Trust, but not in her specialist field. She launched her own employment tribunal against the NHS in January, saying she wanted to raise awareness about the increasing difficulties experienced by religious people in the workplace and claiming the organisation had failed to clear her of wrong doing because it would be 'politically incorrect' to find a Christian innocent. Speaking in January to the Daily Mail Miss Wasteney said: 'I'm not anti-Muslim and I'm always very mindful to be sensitive to other people's beliefs. The senior occupational therapist put her hand on her Muslim colleague's knee while praying for her . 'We discussed our beliefs but I certainly didn't tell her that my way was the only way. I don't even believe it's possible to force someone to convert. 'But the way it was all handled left me looking like a religious nutcase and I would like an acknowledgement that there is a negative attitude towards Christianity in some areas of the public sector.' The latest legal bid, she argues, will have implications for the right to express religious beliefs in the workplace. Miss Wasteney will be represented in court by human rights barrister Paul Diamond, and her appeal is supported by the Christian Legal Centre, according to The Sunday Times. Chief executive of the centre Andrea Williams told the paper: ‘Persecution starts with marginalisation. ‘Where countries let go of a cohesive Christian world view you get chaos and marginalisation. ‘We are letting go of what has given us our freedom.’ Miss Wasteney was suspended for nine months at the St John Howard Centre, a secure psychiatric hospital in east London, after a colleague claimed she had tried to 'bully' her into converting to Christianity . She added:'The tribunal found it was inappropriate for her to engage in prays or give her colleague a book given her senior position. 'She is just an open, friendly, kind person and had a normal relationship with a colleague and there was nothing untoward. 'We are going to the Employment Appeals Tribunal and will be arguing that the ECHR enshrines the freedom to be able to speak about faith in the workplace and not be disciplined for it and have conversations with others. 'We lodged the papers on Thursday. 'The NHS is increasingly dominated by a suffocating liberal agenda that chooses to bend over backwards to accommodate certain beliefs but punishes the Christian.' - June 2013: Enya Nawaz makes a formal complaint about Victoria Wasteney after she prayed for her and invited her to attend church events.

Tom Cleverley has hailed Tim Sherwood's style and insists Aston Villa's attacking gambles are paying off. The midfielder helped Villa reach the FA Cup final after their 2-1 last-four victory over Liverpool on Sunday. Christian Benteke and Fabian Delph scored to cancel out Philippe Coutinho's opener as Villa booked a final showdown with Arsenal on May 30. Tom Cleverley has lauded the impact of Tim Sherwood after reaching the FA Cup final with Aston Villa . Sherwood celebrates after Villa beat Liverpool 2-1 in the FA Cup semi-final at Wembley on Sunday . Christian Benteke  (second right) levelled for Villa after Liverpool took the lead through Philippe Coutinho . And Manchester United loanee Cleverley reckons boss Sherwood's gameplans are allowing Villa to express themselves and clinch results. 'He has brought an attacking style of football. At times we gamble, and it is a case of entertaining the fans and that's what was needed to bring back to the football club,' he said. 'Along with some fantastic defensive displays, we are good to watch and it's (a) great (team) to play in. 'I'm playing with four fantastic midfielders here in Westy (Ashley Westwood), Carlos (Sanchez) and Delphy, so it's an absolute pleasure to play with them every week and I'm really enjoying my football.' Holders Arsenal, who beat Hull 3-2 after extra-time last May, have thrashed Villa 3-0 and 5-0 in the Premier League this season and will go into the final as clear favourites. But Cleverley dismissed any suggestion the game is a foregone conclusion and believes Villa can stun the Gunners to win their first major trophy since 1996. Villa midfield player Fabian Delph (left) scored the winner for his side in the 54th minute . Cleverley (second right) celebrates Delph's goal with  Villa team-mates and says they're confident for the final . 'I think The FA Cup final is a one-off day. Hull nearly managed to do it against them last year and we'll be going into the match in full confidence,' the 25-year-old told TheFA.com . 'When we have played Arsenal this year we have been in bad spells, but hopefully come Saturday, May 30, we will be right on form. 'It hasn't sunk in yet that we will be playing for a major trophy in a massive final - it's (a) hugely proud moment.'
Manchester United had four different scorers On Sunday. At the start of the season I don’t think anyone would have thought that quartet would be anywhere near the team, let alone scoring vital goals in a huge Manchester derby. With all that money flashing around you would have picked Angel di Maria over Juan Mata, Marcus Rojo over Chris Smalling and just about anybody over Marouane Fellaini and Ashley Young. But all four have proved their worth. People said Mata was too slow but his brain is certainly quick enough. Fellaini is now United’s go-to guy and Smalling has improved. Juan Mata celebrates after scoring against Manchester City, and he is part of Louis van Gaal's 'fab four' Ashley Young is another player that few would have expected to be a key part of Van Gaal's plans . Marouane Fellaini has become Manchester United's go-to player in midfielder this season . Chris Smalling has improved and despite the summer spending he remains a key aprt of the team . As for Young, who would have thought he would become one of United’s most consistent players? It just shows how Louis van Gaal works. He doesn’t care about names — he wants to pick the right person at the right time and give everyone a chance. The only potential problem would be a Michael Carrick injury. He has been instrumental in United’s revival. As for Manuel Pellegrini, I feel for him because he seems a good guy but this could be the final straw. Van Gaal doesn’t care about names — he wants to pick the right person at the right time and give  a chance . The only potential problem would be a Michael Carrick injury as he has been instrumental in United’s revival . ADDING GOALS WILL MAKE JAMES A STAR . We've heard a lot about James Ward-Prowse and he was one of my 10 players to watch at the start of the season. He is a fantastic young player with fine technique and an excellent set-piece. But it’s incredible that the penalty he scored on Saturday was only his second goal in 85 games for Southampton. He grew up idolising David Beckham and Steven Gerrard but they did not just provide, they scored too. James Ward-Prowse was one of my 10 players to watch at the start of the season and he scored this weekend . Now he has to go up a level and try and emulate his heroes by scoring goals on a regular basis. If he does that, he could well be one of the young England stars fighting for a midfield place at Euro 2016. Ward-Prowse grew up idolising David Beckham (right) and Steven Gerrard (centre), he must score like them . My tip for Ward-Prowse from August 2014 as one of my 10 players to watch this season . 1998 - The last time all three promoted teams were relegated the following season was in 1997-98. RELEGATION RIVALS . With Leicester’s last-minute win and QPR unlucky to lose against Chelsea, it’s all becoming very tight at the bottom. The three promoted teams are all in the relegation zone as it stands but I’ve got a sneaky feeling one of them will get out of it. And here’s a good omen for them. Only once before in Premier League history have all three promoted teams gone straight back down and that happened 17 seasons ago. The race is on. QPR were unlucky to lose against Chelsea but I’ve got a feeling one of the promoted teams will survive . LENNON LOOKING HAPPY AGAIN . When Aaron Lennon went on loan to Everton, his first photo shoot caused quite a stir. There was barely a hint of a smile and plenty of people wondered if he really wanted to be there. Now he looks like he’s loving life under Roberto Martinez. He is a good player, has scored a few goals and suits how Martinez wants to play. I would not be surprised if he made the switch permanent. Aaron Lennon looks like he’s loving life under Roberto Martinez and he suits the way the manager plays . CRESSWELL'S CURLER . Aaron Cresswell’s free-kick was one of the finest set-piece goals we’ve seen all season. It feels like a lot of free-kicks have gone flying in this campaign and I wondered if the referee’s vanishing spray was having a big impact. But even with the spray, which is a good addition, there hasn’t been a big change in terms of successful free-kicks, as our table shows. Aaron Cresswell’s free-kick against Stoke City was one of the finest set-piece goals we’ve seen all season . Cresswell's was good but there hasn’t been a big change in  successful free-kicks, as our table shows . 4 - In 29 games this season, Bolasie has four goals. In his last 77 Palace games he only scored three. BOLASIE STARTS TO BANG THEM IN . Yannick Bolasie has been one of the main reasons behind Crystal Palace’s incredible run of form this year. Alongside Wilfried Zaha and Jason Puncheon he has formed an incredibly potent attacking trio. Everything he does happens at blistering speed and he absolutely terrorises defenders. He’s such a tricky player and quite old-fashioned in the way he hugs the touchline and takes defenders on. But the very best wide men don’t just create goals, they score them as well. If he keeps firing them in like he did at Sunderland, then his value is only going to go up. Yannick Bolasie has been one of the main reasons behind Crystal Palace’s incredible run of form this year . HOMEGROWN STARS . Francis Coquelin and Harry Kane have been the two breakthrough players of the year and in positions where their clubs needed reinforcements. Coquelin has become such a strong presence in Arsenal’s midfield and Kane is a striking star for Spurs. It just goes to show you don’t always have to go out and spend huge money to solve a problem. The answer can be right under your nose. Harry Kane's progress goes to show you don’t always have to go out and spend huge money to solve issues . SPURS STAGNATE . That was a big win for Tim Sherwood at White Hart Lane. It gave Aston Villa some vital points and he also proved a point to his old employers. But how much has really changed at Spurs? If it weren’t for Harry Kane, there would be some serious criticism heading their way — as the table below shows, they have not improved on last year. It is still a young team and they have time on their side but yet again their season is over sooner than it should be. Tim Sherwood enjoyed Aston Villa's win at White Hart Lane, it proved a point and earned vital league points . TRUE MASTERS . I was lucky enough to go Augusta this week to watch some of the golf and it was fantastic to see how hard all the players work. Plenty of footballers fancy themselves as golfers but these guys show just how dedicated you must be to be the best.
The mother-of-five who police said threw her teenage daughter a party, played naked Twister with her friends and then had sex with an 18-year-old in the bathroom looked upset today as she walked outside her house. Rachel Lynn Lehnardt, 35, from Evans, Georgia, was spotted outside her house wearing a hooded jacket and workout clothes just days after being arrested. She was arrested on Saturday night and has been charged with two counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor. Scroll down for video . Rachel Lynn Lehnardt, 35, from Evans, Georgia, appeared to be stressed as she walked outside her house on Wednesday. She was arrested on Saturday after having a drunken party with her teenage daughter and daughter's friends . The mother-of-five has been charged with two counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor and is out on bail . The details of the drunken party emerged when Lehnardt met with her Alcoholics Anonymous sponsor last Friday and told her about the wild party. The sponsor then contacted authorities. She told the woman that her children, who are aged between four and 16, were with their father when her oldest daughter texted her to ask if she could bring over some friends. Lehnardt allegedly responded: 'Come on, let's party', WJBF reported. When the teenagers arrived, she allegedly allowed them to drink alcohol and smoke marijuana in her home, before she played naked Twister with them in the living room. See more video at WJBF . She allegedly threw the party at her home in Evans, Georgia, pictured, and lost custody of her children after the incident . She allegedly played naked Twister with the group of teens before she had sex with an 18-year-old male in the bathroom. She later had sex with her daughter's 16-year-old boyfriend . While the youngsters continued playing, she allegedly went into a bathroom and had sex with an 18-year-old man, the sponsor told authorities. When she returned, she brought out sex toys and started to use them on herself in front of the teenagers, she told her sponsor, Augusta Crime reported. She later went to bed alone and around 3.30am, she awoke to find someone having sex with her, she told her sponsor. 'She stated at first she thought it was the 18-year-old from earlier, but then realized it was the 16-year-old who was in fact her daughter's boyfriend,' Lehnardt's sponsor told deputies. Lehnardt told police that she awoke to find the 16-year-old having sex with her and that it was her teenage daughter's boyfriend . She also allegedly used sex toys in front of the teenagers and showed her daughter explicit photos of her having sex with her current boyfriend . The daughter told her mother she felt guilty because the boyfriend's 10-inch penis was so large she could not have sex with him, and he needed to have sex with her mother instead. While the incident sounds as if the 16-year-old raped the mother, Sheriff's spokesman Captain Steve Morris said there was no evidence of a crime and no charges are pending against the boy. No sexual crime charges have been filed against Lehnardt because 16 is the legal age of consent. Lehnardt also allegedly told the sponsor that she had shown her daughter explicit photos, including of Lehnardt having sex with her current boyfriend. The sponsor said that the mother has also previously spoken about being a porn addict. Following the incident, an emergency custody hearing was held and she lost custody of her five children, who are aged four, six, eight, 10 and 16, WJBF reported. Police became aware for the incident after Lehnardt told her Alcohol Anonymous sponsor about the party thrown in her Evans home (neighborhood pictured), and the sponsor alerted the Columbia County Sheriff's Office . At their meeting last week, the sponsor asked Lehnardt how long she had been sober and her future plans for sobriety, and the mother told her about losing custody of the children days before. After their meeting, the woman, who was only recently assigned to sponsor Lehnardt, contacted the Columbia County Sheriff's Office and the mother was arrested on Saturday. She has been released from the Columbia County Detention Center after posting a $3,200 bond, according to the Columbia County News-Times. According to online profiles, Lehnardt crafts and paints dolls. The children's father is in the military. Lehnardt was arrested after sharing details of the incident with her Alcoholics Anonymous sponsor, who then went to authorities. As part of the AA's 12 Step program, members write a list of incidents they feel guilty about and confide in their sponsor about the acts (known as the Fifth Step). The person is then required to make amends for past wrongdoings, as long as doing so does not cause harm to others. While there is an expectation of anonymity at meetings, there is no guarantee, and experts recommend exercising caution when detailing crimes, according to The Fix. AA literature simply states that 'anonymity provides protection for all members from identification as alcoholics'. The main 'Understanding Anonymity' booklet does not mention safety from disclosure of a crime and there have been multiple cases of AA members being convicted of crimes, including, murder after confessing to their sponsors. But there has also been some debate over whether the confessions can be used in court. In 2001, a 1995 murder conviction was thrown out after it was ruled that a killer's confession to fellow AA members was constitutionally protected and shouldn't have been used against him. The decision was reached after the judge deemed the 12 Step program had religious undertones, meaning that the members engaged in  religious activity, which is constitutionally protected.
A Chinese-born American geologist was deported and returned to his Texas home following his release from prison in China after serving nearly eight years on charges of 'illegally procuring state secrets'. Xue Feng returned to his family in Houston on Friday following his release from Beijing's No. 2 Prison. He served all but ten months of his eight year sentence after getting it reduced for good behavior. Xue Feng returned to his family in Houston, Texas, on Friday following his release from Beijing's No. 2 Prison . The 50-year-old doctor served all but ten months of his eight year sentence at the Chinese prison (pictured) Xue Min (right) waits with daughter Guo Jie (left) for the trial of her brother outside a Chinese court in 2010 . At the time of his release, Xue was the only American citizen serving a sentence in a Chinese prison for the crime of endangering state security, according to the  Dui Hua foundation. The foundation has long advocated on Xue's behalf. Executive director John Kamm said: 'Dui Hua is delighted that Dr Xue has finally been reunited with his family in America after a terrible ordeal,' 'The foundation wishes him every success as he rebuilds his life.' The 50-year-old Xue was detained in November of 2007 and sentenced in 2010 on charges of illegally gathering information on China's oil industry. His case raised questions about whether normal business activities elsewhere might conflict with China's vague state security laws. Supporters also said Xue was physically abused in detention and denied proper legal rights. American diplomats had lobbied hard for Xue's release, saying his alleged crimes didn't warrant the harshness of his sentence. Tong Wei, the lawyer for the jailed American geologist, seen leaving Beijing High People's Court in 2011 . President Obama personally lobbied for Xue's release during a visit to Beijing in November of 2009, the New York Times reported. After a court upheld Xue's conviction in February of 2011, American ambassador Jon Huntsman said: 'This has been a long, difficult and painful ordeal for Xue Feng, but not only for Xue but also for his wife, Nan, and his two kids. 'We ask the Chinese government to consider an immediate humanitarian parole of Xue Feng, thereby allowing him to get back to his family and his way of life.' Xue was born in China and earned a doctorate at the University of Chicago, where he was praised by his advisers for his thoroughness and hard work. After becoming a United States citizen, he returned to his native country to work for US consultancy IHS Energy, now known as IHS Inc. In pronouncing him guilty, the Beijing No. 1 Intermediate People's Court said his actions 'endangered our country's national security'. The verdict said Xue received documents on geological conditions of onshore oil wells and a database that gave the coordinates of more than 30,000 oil and gas wells belonging to China National Petroleum Corp. and listed subsidiary PetroChina Ltd.
Sickening footage has surfaced of a teenage girl being struck by a fast moving car and flung into the air before appearing to land on her head. The driver can be heard beeping his horn at the girl who is standing middle of the road before hitting into her with a horrifying thud. Astonishingly, the 15-year-old girl, who was hit on Entrance Road in Warrilla at about 1am on Wednesday morning, suffered minor injuries and has already been released from Shellharbour Hospital. The driver can be heard beeping his horn at the girl who is standing middle of the road before hitting into her with a horrifying thud . A witness told Illawarra Mercury that the girl was drinking heavily at a nearby houseparty and had been 'mucking around' with friends in the middle of the road. 'All the girls and boys ran over the road. They seen a car coming and decided - I don't know what. She was safe and then ... she would have been safe but the car flew into her,' the witness said. They said the girl was unconscious for about five minutes after the crash, but that she evaded serious injury. A witness claimed the girl suffered grazing and a possible fracture, and was limping after the incident. Police have already spoken with the driver and are continuing their investigations. It is understood witnesses have refused to come forward for fear of being punished for underage drinking. The sickening vision shows the girl being flung into the air before appearing to land on her head . Amazingly, the 15-year-old girl suffered minor injuries and has already been released from Shellharbour Hospital .
It was 25 years ago this week that the skeletal remains of a woman were found near Daytona Beach in Florida - and police are still trying to find out who she is, and who killed her. The Jane Doe was found in a wooded area in Volusia County on April 23, 1990. Investigators believe her badly decomposed remains, which consisted mostly just bones, had been there for up to eight weeks before they were discovered. The death was ruled a homicide and the case remains open, and police hope a new facial reconstruction using the latest technology with help them finally solve the murder. Unsolved homicide: Forensics have used the latest technology to reconstruct the skeletal remains of a woman found near Daytona Beach 25 years ago this week to produce this image. She was never identified . A forensic artist recently created a lifelike, computer-generated image of the woman’s face, which is the biggest development in the case in years,The Daytona Beach News Journal reported. The Jane Doe is described as between 25 and 40 years old, about 5-feet 4-inches in height and of a medium build. At the time of her death, her brown hair was tied into pig tails. According to forensics, the woman seems to have had multiple children. The new reconstruction shows the vast improvements in forensic science over the years. The last image, released in 2001, was done by a FBI-trained facial reconstruction artist using the victim's skull. Advancements: The last image of Jane Doe was done in 2001 using the controversial method of forensic facial reconstruction, which relies on the victim's skull and an artist building the face using clay . Scene: The victim was found in a wooded area east of Clyde Morris Boulevard in Volusia County in April 1990 . Investigators are urging anyone with information to call Sgt. Pat Thoman at 386-254-1535. Anonymous tips can also be lodged using Crime Stoppers of Volusia and Flagler counties at 888-277-TIPS (8477). There is a cash reward on offer of up to $5,000.
The diversity of life on Earth is increasing despite dire warnings that the planet is facing a mass extinction, a leading writer has claimed. Stewart Brand, president of the Long Now Foundation and editor of the Whole Earth Catalogue, believes the focus on widespread extinctions may actually be harmful. Instead he argues it is highly unlikely that the planet is facing a sixth mass extinction as many threatened species are recovering. This chart shows the increase in marine biodiversity from the fossil record and the five mass extinction events . His views are likely to be controversial with conservationists who have been warning that human activities risk killing off a large proportion of species on Earth in an event to rival the extinction of the dinosaurs. Mr Brand, who campaigns for long term solutions to the world's problems rather than short term policy decisions, said that the rate of discovery of new species was currently outstripping the loss of species to extinction. 1. Indonesia - 184 . 2. Madagascar - 114 . 3. Mexico - 101 . 4. India - 94 . 5. Brazil - 82 . 6. China - 73 . 7. Malaysia - 70 . 8. Thailand - 55 . 9. Australia - 55 . 10. Peru - 54 . Writing for Aeon, he said: 'Viewing every conservation issue through the lens of extinction threat is simplistic and usually irrelevant. 'Worse, it introduces an emotional charge that makes the problem seem cosmic and overwhelming rather than local and solvable.' Instead he argues that the trends for conservation are actually 'looking bright' as depleted ecosystems are being enriched and damage in others is slowing. He said: 'The five historic mass extinctions eliminated 70 per cent or more of all species in a relatively short time. That is not going on now.' Mr Brand points to recent research by the ecologist Mark Costello at the University of Auckland who found that the number of new species being recorded was now at around 18,000 a year. They said that the current extinction rate of one per cent of species per decade was far lower than the discovery rate of three per cent per decade. Fossil records also indicate that biodiversity in the world has been increasing for the past 200 million years and is now at its highest level ever. The black rhino, pictured, was considered to be one of the most endangered species in the world and intensive efforts have been made to help conserve the species and its numbers are slowly beginning to rise again . Major efforts to remove rats from Codfish Island in New Zealand has allowed the kakapo (above) to recover . Mr Brand also points to the efforts that have taken place on many islands around the world - where species are most vulnerable to extinction. He said that schemes to eradicate invasive species like rats and goats had been hugely successful and allowed many island species to bounce back. He also pointed to the example of cod, which the ICUN Red List describes as being threatened with extinction, but many cod fisheries are now recovering. Mr Brand, who is also a campaigner to reintroduce extinct species such as woolly mammoths and passenger pigeons, believes biotechnology could also help to bring other species back from the brink by allowing their genetic diversity to be improved. Sumatran orangutans (pictured) have a population of just a few thousand as their forests have been destroyed . He said that some wild animals are moving back into areas where they have long been absent by themselves. Salmon for example have moved back into the Rhine, Seine and the Thames as the water has becoe cleaner. Wolves, lynx and brown bears are also spreading in many parts of Europe. He said that even with climate change, it is unlikely that all of the 23,214 species currently deemed as threatened with extinction would die out. Ordovician-Silurian mass extinction - 443.4 million years ago . This was the third largest extinction in Earth's history, and had two peaks of dying separated by hundreds of thousands of years. Around 26 per cent of all marine families were wiped out and 60 per cent of all genera - an estimated 82-88 per cent of all species. Late Devonian mass extinction - 375-359 million years ago . Three quarters of all species on Earth died out in the Late Devonian mass extinction, though it may have been a series of extinctions over several million years. Around 22 per cent of all marine families, and 57 per cent of all genera were wiped out - an estimated 79-87 per cent of all species. Permian mass extinction - 252 million years ago . The Permian mass extinction has been nicknamed The Great Dying, since an incredible 96 per cent of species died out. All life on Earth today is descended from the 4 per cent of species that survived. Triassic-Jurassic mass extinction - 201 million years ago . There were two or three phases of extinction that made up the Triassic-Jurassic mass extinction event. 22 per cent of all marine families and 53 per cent of all genera - an estimated 76-84 per cent of all species. Cretaceous-Tertiary mass extinction - 66 million years ago . The Cretaceous-Tertiary mass extinction was the event that wiped out the dinosaurs. However, many other organisms perished including 16 per cent of all marine families and 47 per cent of all genera - an estimated 71-81 per cent of all species. The map above shows the countries with the highest number of threatened mammals in the world . There are more than 1.5 million known species in the world. Mr Brand said he did not believe climate change is likely to have much impact on the loss of wildlife as many species will evolve and adapt to cope. He said: 'My own prediction is that climate change will be deemed intolerable for humans long before it speeds up extinction rates, and even if radical steps have to be taken to head it off, they will be taken.'
A 3-year-old's recurring nightmare about a mysterious white van may help shed light on what really happened the day her mother died in an SUV crash that Virginia police have ruled a tragic accident. Natali Castellanos-Tyler, 30, a married mother of three from Chesterfield County, was returning home from a birthday party February 21 with her daughter, Elisa, in the backseat when she supposedly slid off a rain-soaked road, slammed her silver Ford Explorer into a tree and died at the scene. Investigators concluded that the crash was a one-car collision that was caused by poor road conditions. Scroll down for video . Loss: Natali Castellanos-Tyler, 30, pictured with her husband, Craig, and their two children, was killed in an SUV crash in Virginia two months ago to the day . Deadly impact: Castellanos-Tyler was just a few miles from her home when her 2002 Ford Explorer ran off the road in the 15400 block of Genito Road and careened into a tree . Accident: Police said the crash was a one-car collision caused by a rain-soaked road . Elisa Tyler emerged from the accident largely unscathed, but according to her father, Craig Tyler, the little girl has been plagued by disturbing nightmares and daytime visions about the accident. 'She’ll just start walking and she’ll start screaming, "The van, the white van!”' the young widower told CBS6. 'I’ll say, "What happened with the white van?" And she says, "It hurt me — it hurt my car!”' Tyler, who is now raising his their children, ages 9, 3 and 1, on his own after his wife's passing, at first did not know what to make of Elisa's night terrors. But then this past weekend he came across several Facebook posts from nearby communities of Foxcroft and Magnolia Green about a series of hit-and-run accidents involving a white box truck. One Facebook user, 17-year-old Caitlyn Thomas, claimed she was side-swiped by a white delivery-style truck on Otterdale Road March 30; the impact of the collision reportedly sent a piece of her side-view mirror crashing through the driver's window. Doubt: Little Elisa, pictured left with her parents and baby brother, and right with her mom, has been having nightmares and daytime visions about a white van, which her father believes may have something to do with the crash . Widower: Craig Tyler says the toddler, pictured above, has told him that the white van in her dreams 'hurt' her and her car . Sightings: A plain white delivery-style box truck, possibly similar to the one pictured above, has been linked to no fewer than three hit-and-run incidents in which two cars and a school bus were side-swiped . According to an eyewitness, the driver of the truck briefly slowed down and turned his head back to look at Thomas' damaged car, but then took off from the scene without waiting for police to arrive. A day earlier, Subastree Thompson said she was also side-swiped by a white box truck on the same road. According to the woman, who was driving with her 3-year-old in the backseat, the white van was carrying two or three men sitting in a single row. The van slowed down for a moment but then sped off before Thompson had a chance to take down its license plate number. Then on April 3, a plain white van matching the same description as in the two earlier incidents allegedly side-swiped a school bus filled with students from Cosby High School. Chesterfield County Police said they were investigating a possible connection between the crashes, but a spokesperson for the department said there was no evidence in Castellano-Tyler's collision to suggest the involvement of another vehicle. Dashing duo: Natali, a native of El Salvador, and Craig met by chance at a restaurant several years ago and married in a courthouse in 2013 . The 30-year-old leaves behind three children, including a 9-year-old boy from a previous relationship in El Salvador and her and Craig's two kids, ages 1 and 3 . Tragic twist: The couple had been planning to have a formal wedding ceremony this coming July and Natali had picked out an ivory lace dress (pictured) for the big day. Instead, she was laid to rest in her dream gown . The woman was just a few miles from her home when at 2pm her 2002 Ford Explorer ran off the road in the 15400 block of Genito Road and careened into a tree, reported the station WRIC. Paramedics arrived on the scene but it was too late for the mother. Her daughter Elisa was taken to a hospital with minor scrapes and bruises. On Monday, nearly two months to the day after the crash, Natali’s husband, Craig, wrote on his Facebook page that he was praying ‘for the truth to be revealed.’ He and Natali, a native of El Salvador, met years earlier at a local restaurant and married with little fanfare in a courthouse on June 21, 2012. The couple had been planning to have a formal wedding ceremony this coming July, followed by a long-awaited honeymoon. Natali had an ivory lace gown picked out for the big day, but instead of wearing it to go down the aisle, she was laid to rest in her dream dress February 27 in the presence of her heartbroken family. A GoFundMe account has been set up to help cover some of the Tyler family's living expenses. So far, more than $15,440 has been raised.
A one-year-old boy who was shot and killed by another toddler who picked up and fired a loaded gun has been pictured. Braylon Robinson was playing at a house in Cleveland, Ohio, on Sunday when another three-year-old boy found the unattended weapon and pulled the trigger. The bullet struck the baby boy in the face. Minutes later, he was rushed to an area hospital, where he was later pronounced dead. It is unclear whether the infant was related to the older boy. Now, investigators are apparently trying to determine where the gun came from - and the identity of the person responsible for bringing it into the house and leaving it within the toddler's reach. Scroll down for video . Horrifying: Braylon Robinson was killed while playing at a house in Cleveland, Ohio. Another three-tear-old boy found the unattended weapon and pulled the trigger . Tragic: A three-year-old boy has shot dead a one-year-old baby after picking up a gun that had been left unattended in a Cleveland, Ohio, home, police said on Sunday night. Above, police outside the property . Cousin Trashawn Robinson told NBC on Monday the family has been torn apart by the youngster's death. He said the boy was 'always smiling' and 'kept everyone happy'. 'He didn't even make it to the hospital,' he said. 'Everybody loved Braylon.' Speaking to Cleveland.com, Cleveland Police Chief Calvin Williams said that this person will likely face charges in relation to the shooting, which has shocked residents across the city's east side. 'It's a sad day for Cleveland, Williams told reporters outside the home. 'This fascination that we have with handguns, not just in this city but in this country, has to stop. This is a senseless loss of life.' He added: 'Currently we're investigating where this firearm came from. We're also investigating how this tragedy actually happened. A three-year-old can't be held accountable for a tragedy like this. 'There have to be adults that either supplied the weapons, had charge of the weapons or knew the weapons were there and didn't do anything to safeguard them.' Investigation: The child, who has not been identified, fired the weapon after discovering it inside the house in East 63rd Street, where s at least one adult were reportedly staying. Above, investigators inspect the scene . Police chief: Cleveland Police Chief Calvin Williams (pictured) said that the person responsible for leaving the gun attended will likely face charges in relation to the shooting, which has shocked residents in the city . On Sunday afternoon, when the shooting occurred, the baby's mother could be heard screaming on the back porch after learning of the death of her son, who was later named as Braylon Robinson. Cleveland Emergency Medical Service Capt. Michael Threat told ABC the infant had been shot in the face. Throughout the afternoon, emergency crews were seen entering and exiting the home. Neighbors said that the mother lived in the house with at least three small children. 'They were really nice,' next-door neighbor Larry Simpson said, adding: 'It's a shame this had to happen.' Another neighbor told Fox: 'I was lost for words. It's sad. Why is there a gun in the house?' The toddler's parents' names were not released immediately. An investigation is ongoing.

Northampton's maligned hit man is primed to go big-game hunting again  with no intention of toning down his use of legitimate force in the wake of renewed criticism. Courtney Lawes arrived in France with the Saints, ahead of the Champions Cup quarter-final against mighty Clermont Auvergne, carrying notoriety as excess baggage. His brutal tackle on France fly-half Jules Plisson at Twickenham last month, in the Six Nations finale, angered the visitors to the extent that they tried to have him banned. While the match officials and citing officer deemed that no action was needed, the England lock has been derided as a thug across the Channel and there were cries of protest in these parts, too. England lock Courtney Lawes made a trademark hit on France fly-half Jules Plisson . Click here to read Jeff's article on Lawes' tackle . Writing in these pages, Jeff Powell suggested that Lawes should apologise for an offence that he argued would put parents off allowing their children to play such a brutal, damaging game. The comments found their target but the 26-year-old is a laid-back character and was unfazed by the storm he had created. ‘I just took it on the chin and thought, “People are going to say what they think sometimes, and sometimes people are going to view things differently”,’ said Lawes as he prepared for another momentous Anglo-French encounter. ‘Obviously he has the outlet of the Daily Mail to post his thoughts. I tweeted him. I wasn’t fussed about it but I thought I’d send him a little tweet, just to get my own back a bit!’ Aside from that particular outburst of condemnation, there were widespread concerns expressed about the timing and legality of his tackling style, but Lawes is unperturbed and emphasised his largely clean disciplinary record. ‘To be honest, as long as it is legal and I’m not putting my team in any jeopardy doing it, in terms of me getting booked or sent off or anything like that, I’m going to do anything I can to help the team,’ he said. ‘I’m not the sort of person who is fussed about what people think of me. I’m only bothered about what I can do for my team and for myself as a player. Coaches know how good you are, no matter what things other people are saying outside the room. Lawes crumples Plisson in the aftermath of his monstrous tackle on the French fly half . ‘The fact is that my record is very clean. I’ve only been cited once and I’ve never been red-carded. I don’t think I’ve had many yellows, if any, this year. I don’t have a malicious streak. I know I’m not a thug, I don’t go around punching or fighting, any of that rubbish. ‘I just get on with the game. I don’t even allow people to get me too aggravated, I just get on with my own thing. I’m comfortable being who I am. If people want to say I’m something else, that’s fair enough.’ One of the accusations levelled at Lawes is that he sets out to intimidate smaller opponents, notably half-backs, leading to a multitude of one-sided collisions. He argues that trying to unsettle and nullify these primary decision- makers is a reasonable and vital aspect of his repertoire. ‘If you can put pressure on the 10, then you go out and put pressure on the 10, and if you can do it legally then why can’t you do it?’ he said. ‘That’s the way I see it. I’ve got that kind of timing around the ruck and I’ve got the speed to get to the 10. My size is the reason that the impact is so big, but I don’t go looking for it. A livid Yoann Maestri pushed Lawes in the face and grapples with the England man following his challenge . Lawes and Maestri continue their disagreement on their feet as matters threaten to boil over . ‘It makes a big difference to the game if you can stop the 10 from passing or stop that particular play. It doesn’t even have to be a big hit, it just makes a difference if that 10 knows that he has pressure on him. ‘There is obviously a line between a legitimate and a late tackle because people get yellow-carded for late tackles. ‘You watch the replay of the hit on Plisson and the other player has not caught the ball before we’ve hit the ground. The fact is, had the tackle not looked as severe as it did no-one would have said anything. ‘The only reason is because of the impact, which looks bad because he’s landed on his head. I haven’t tipped him up or anything like that — I’ve just followed through with my tackle. I didn’t even know he didn’t have the ball until I looked up afterwards.’ 26-year-old Lawes passes the ball during a Northampton Saints training session earlier this week . Lawes has revealed that he intends to maintain his destructive style of play for Northampton on Saturday . Asked if he intended to resume normal, destructive service for Northampton on Saturday — in defiance of the criticism — he added: ‘Yeah, of course. I’ve never done anything to get myself sent off in terms of my tackle timing or whatever, so why would I stop if it is legal?’ Northampton, the champions of England, face a colossal challenge against a French club who simply do not lose at home, especially in Europe. The Saints and three of their fellow Aviva Premiership teams have daunting ties away from home, but captain Dylan Hartley has hope for the quartet. ‘I am fully confident in ourselves,’ Hartley said. ‘I think Wasps have a big ask in Toulon but we saw with 14 men the other night how dangerous they can be. I think Sarries against Racing could get a result there. And Bath v Leinster, who knows? I think there could be a few upsets.’
Shay Given has revealed the pain still lingers from Ruud Gullit’s decision to snub him for the 1999 FA Cup final between Newcastle and Manchester United. The Republic of Ireland goalkeeper played every round of Newcastle’s run but was dropped in favour of Steve Harper for the Wembley showpiece, won 2-0 by Sir Alex Ferguson’s side. Given has yet to experience a truly fulfilling visit to the national stadium. He played in the 1998 FA Cup final loss to Arsenal, as well as the semi-final defeat to Chelsea in 2000 . Shay Given will start for Aston Villa against Liverpool in Sunday's FA Cup semi-final at Wembley . He has an FA Cup winners’ medal from 2011 but was an unusued substitute for the final against Stoke with Joe Hart in net. He is out to make amends against Liverpool. ‘It was nice to be part of winning it with Man City but when you don’t play it doesn’t have the same value,’ he said. ‘I don’t know where my medal is to be honest. ‘1999 was a bit of a slap in the face. Do you ever get over it, I suppose? It’s not an easy one. Ruud Gullit didn’t even tell me, he got the goalkeeping coach Terry Gennoe to tell me I wasn’t playing. ‘But you can’t look back in football, you’ve just got to look forward. I’d love to win a trophy and make a bit of history at Aston Villa.’ The 38-year-old has played in all four of Villa's FA Cup matches this season and has kept two clean-sheets . Villa manager Tim Sherwood confirmed Given will start on Sunday, a day before the Irishman turns 39 . Manager Tim Sherwood has confirmed Given, who turns 39 tomorrow, will keep his Cup place rather than be replaced by No 1 Brad Guzan. Given has played every round of the competition, beginning under Paul Lambert, and make key saves along the way. Given admitted he felt matches of this magnitude had passed him by when he was out on loan at Middlesbrough last season, as Lambert jettisoned players he needed to remove off the wage bill. Last April, he was in the dugout assisting Villa’s former manager as coach when Ian Culverhouse and Gary Karsa were suspended. ‘I am employed by Aston Villa and I felt I could help out,’ said Given. ‘Life is too short to have grudges.’ Sherwood watched his Villa side in training as they prepare for the Sunday's crunch clash . Sherwood, his former Blackburn teammate, has provided a ‘new lease of life’. ‘Tim is a very ambitious guy, he wants to keep the club in the Premier League and win the FA Cup. There have been occasions this season where people have seen the angry side. But ten minutes later he is putting his arm around the same player. One of his best skills is man management. He knows how to get the best out of people.’ Given has regained his place in the Ireland team and is wants to play at Euro 2016 should his country qualify. He would also like to take the goalkeeping shirt off Brad Guzan in the Premier League. He has a year left on his contract this summer and will discuss his prospects with Sherwood. ‘This run has shown I’m still capable and hopefully it gives a seed of doubt into the manager’s head as well that if he wants to mix it up in the Premier League.’ Aston Villa defeated rivals West Brom 2-0 in the last round to book their semi-final appearance at Wembley .

A former New York City investment banker faces trial in eastern Long Island on charges he raped a woman he took home after celebrating his birthday at a Hamptons nightclub. Jason Lee, 38, a former managing director at Goldman Sachs, was arrested in August 2013 after the woman accused him of attacking her in a bathroom at the home he had rented with his wife in the summer resort town of East Hampton. Lee has pleaded not guilty and is free on $100,000 bail. He has opted for a non-jury trial before Suffolk County Court Judge Barbara Kahn. Charged: Former Goldman Sachs managing director Jason Lee, 38, faces charges of allegedly raping a 20-year-old Irish woman in the Hamptons in August 2013 . Lee's attorney, Manhattan lawyer Andrew Lankler, did not respond to email and telephone messages seeking comment. A lawyer who represented Lee at his arraignment in 2013 said his client was innocent and that the sex was consensual. Prosecutors said Lee was celebrating his birthday at Georgica restaurant and lounge in Wainscott when he invited the woman and her friends back to his rental home for a pool party. The woman, a then-20-year-old Irish student said that once at the house, Lee undressed, forced his way into a bathroom and pinned her to the floor. Scene: This is the house on Clover Leaf Lane in East Hampton, New York, where the sexual assault allegedly occurred . Restaurant: The group met at Georgica's restaurant and lounge, pictured, popular with the jetset summer crowd of East Hampton . Suffolk County District Attorney Tom Spota said the woman was treated at a hospital following the assault. A nurse, who was trained in sexual assault cases, examined the woman after the alleged incident and said her injuries, including bruises, were consistent with her allegations, according to the Irish Times. At the time of the incident, police who arrived at the house reportedly found the banker cowering in his Range Rover. It also emerged Lee's own friend, Rene Duncan, called the police, believing one of the alleged victim's friends had stolen a car from Lee's rental home. Accused: Lee was a managing director for Goldman Sachs and works at the investment bank's headquarters at 200 West Street in Lower Manhattan. A representative from the company said he left the firm last year . But when police arrived, the young woman's brother drew a female officer aside and led her into the house where his sobbing sister reported she had been raped, according to The East Hampton Star. A source told the newspaper that Lee then went to the driveway of the $33,000-a-month summer home he was renting, got into his late model Range Rover, which was dark with tinted windows, and hid. But officers soon found him cowering inside, the source said. One of the other foreign students borrowed Duncan's car to drive home another friend and did not return, prompting Duncan to call the cops. However, the car was found the next day. Spota said the woman was  was working in the U.S. at the time and was visiting her brother in the Hamtons. She is expected to return to the United States from Ireland to testify during the trial. Opening statement are scheduled for Wednesday morning. A Goldman Sachs spokesman said Lee left the firm sometime last year; he had worked in the equity capital markets department.
Eerie footage has emerged showing a mysterious 100 metre-wide black ring of smoke floating over clear skies in Kazakhstan - convincing locals it was caused by a UFO. The clip was filmed on Saturday in Shortandy village, 40 miles north of the capital Astana, and captures the  cloud hovering in the sky for 15 minutes before suddenly vanishing without trace. The video has been viewed more than 50,000 times since being uploaded to YouTube, prompting all manner of bizarre explanations for the phenomenon - with many seemingly convinced it is definitive proof of extra-terrestrial life. Spine-chilling: The creepy footage shows a mysterious 100 metre-wide black ring of smoke floating over clear skies in Kazakhstan - convincing locals it was caused by a UFO . Confused locals watched the mysterious cloud hover ominously over Shortandy for a quarter of an hour on Saturday morning before it vanished as quickly as it appeared. Once the cloud had rapidly dispersed, no trace of it was left in the sky. Speaking to local news website Today.kz, villager Oleg Menshikov said: 'It was like a black cloud. We saw it at around 4 pm on April 3. It dissipated like smoke, but it was completely odourless.' Within minutes of the video being shared online, YouTube users began to question whether the thick black hoop was an alien spacecraft, while others suggested it might just be cigarette smoke immediately in front of the camera but giving the perception it is in the sky. Others thought the cloud was likely to be a naturally occurring weather event known as a thermal microburst, which is caused by a falling mass of warm air. Mysterious: The clip was filmed on Saturday in Shortandy village, 40 miles north of the capital Astana, and captures the cloud hovering in the sky for 15 minutes before suddenly vanishing without trace . Dispersing rapidly: Confused locals watched the mysterious cloud hover ominously over Shortandy for a quarter of an hour on Saturday morning before it vanished as quickly as it appeared . Experts believe the cloud was roughly 100 metres in diameter and floated close to a mile in the air. Speaking to Russia Today, Andrey Solodovnik - associate physics professor at the Northern Kazakhstan State University - dismissed suggestions the cloud was caused by aliens. He said that based on similar clouds seen in the skies in recent years, the giant black hoop was likely to have been little more than a smoke ring generated by combustion at nearby factories. Plenty of industrial machinery is known to create ring-shaped clouds of smoke, though these are usually lighter-coloured, considerably less dense and vanish in just one or two minutes. In the latest instance it is likely the cloud was far more visible and hung around in the sky for much longer than usual for the simple reason it was cloudless day with little to no wind.
Just over a decade ago Gianfranco Zola was voted the greatest Chelsea player of all time in a poll of the club's supporters. This may seem a little premature, but as Eden Hazard prepares for to make his 100th Barclays Premier League appearance for Chelsea at QPR on Sunday, the little magician could have a rival in years to come. Hazard is some player, one of the elite in English football with those dazzling runs and the sparkling feet that can open up the best defences in the league. Eden Hazard has developed into one of the world's best players after flourishing at Chelsea . Hazard has proven himself as a goalscorer and a creator of chances during his time with Chelsea . Hazard celebrates scoring against Hull earlier this season as Chelsea march towards the Premier League title . This season he has been imperious, full of movement and flexibility as Chelsea close in on a double of Capital One Cup and Premier League in Jose Mourinho's second season back at Stamford Bridge. After Chelsea's 1-1 draw with Paris Saint-Germain in February at the Parc des Princes, Mourinho demanded more protection from referees for Hazard. Chelsea's dancing winger is a marked man. The PFA young player of the year had been fouled nine times, with Laurent Blanc's team taking it in turns to nobble the Chelsea No 10 in the first leg of their Champions League second round tie. He has scored some special goals, 17 so far with another nine assists, as Mourinho's team close in on a fourth Premier League title in the Abramovich era. On Sunday, April 26 the PFA players' player of the year award could be his, joining a list of winners that includes Luis Suarez, Gareth Bale, Wayne Rooney, Cristiano Ronaldo, Thierry Henry and his Chelsea team-mate John Terry in recent times. He has grown to love English football, adapting to the demands of the Premier League and the numerous managers he has already played for since his move from Lille in 2012. Roberto Di Matteo was still Chelsea's manager when Hazard tweeted that he was joining 'this season's Champions League winner' ahead of his £32million move from France. He made an impressive start in the Premier League, assisting the opening goal for Chelsea in the 2-0 victory at Wigan and winning the penalty for Frank Lampard to convert at the DW Stadium. Hazard joined Chelsea from Lille for £32million in 2012 after the Blues beat a host to clubs to his signature . Hazard was involved in a controversial incident at Swansea when he kicked the ball as it lay under the ball boy . Hazard was sent off after the ball-boy incident as Chelsea were beaten in the Capital One Cup semi-final . Hazard, his wife Natasha and their kids enjoy some off time at Disneyland Paris . Di Matteo loved him as a player and he went through a notable dip in form when the European Cup-winning coach was fired after the 4-1 defeat against Juventus in the Champions League. A few months later he was sent off when he infamously wrestled with a ball-boy during Chelsea's Capital One Cup semi-final defeat against Swansea City at the Liberty Stadium. He finished the season with a Europa League medal after Chelsea's victory over Benfica the Amsterdam ArenA, but it is the arrival of Mourinho that has transformed his game. Last season there was a period of frustration among Chelsea's first team players because they shared the view of the coach that they had signed a world class talent. Despite his ability he was often one of the first to leave after training, heading home to his family - wife Natasha and their two young children, after a quick shower and lunch with his team-mates. Slowly he has bought into dressing room culture. There is a ruthless streak about him these days and Mourinho, to his credit, drew it out of him after meeting Hazard's father, along with his lawyer, after Belgium's disappointing World Cup in Brazil. Hazard has grown in stature since he was handed Juan Mata's old No 10 shirt, requesting the jersey after the winger left for Manchester United in January 2014. The No 10 shirt is also the number of his hero Zinedine Zidane, the player a young Hazard idolised when he was making his way through Belgian football before his move to Lille. In recent times he has been encouraged to drift across the front three positions, interchanging with Oscar (in the centre) and Willian (on the right) when it takes his fancy. Hazard helped Chelsea win the Europa League under Rafa Benitez when they beat Benfica in the final . Hazard, pictured alongside Luis Suarez, was named the PFA Young Player of the Year last season . Hazard added a second trophy to his Chelsea collection this season when the Blues won the Capital One Cup . Jose Mourinho transformed Hazard's game after he suffered a dip following the departure of Roberto Di Matteo . Mourinho poses with Hazard after he was named Chelsea's Player of the Year last season . He is the focal point of Chelsea's attack, a willing outlet with a first touch that you can melt when he takes it on the instep of his right boot. He has been scoring goals again, adding to his tally this season in recent weeks with strikes for club and country as the season hurtles towards the finish line. At 24 he is maturing nicely, a humble man who impressed Chelsea's hierarchy during the complex negotiations over a new contract towards the end of last year. He has never been responsible for the glut of stories linking him with a move back to France to play for Paris Saint-Germain and he consistently told the club that he was willing to remain at Stamford Bridge. Hazard's contract talks were reminiscent of Gary Neville at Manchester United, leaving it with the club to determine the terms on his new five-year contract. Chelsea settled on £200,000 a week. To those who know him, he speaks of trophies and a hunger to be remembered as a player who contributed to one of the most successful periods in Chelsea's history. Given time, he could even be remembered as the very best. Hazard recently signed a bumper new five-year deal at Chelsea worth £200,000 a week . In Hazard, Gianfranco Zola may soon have a rival as Chelsea's greatest ever player .
Could these be the boots of a disembodied samurai soldier, lingering mysteriously behind this little girl? A spooky dark visage that appears behind the child in this photograph has sparked online rumours of a ghost. This photograph was captured in Kanagawa prefecture, Japan - 'nearby some samurai tombs', apparently - late last year. The Reddit user who posted it online - a friend of the photographer - insisted it was 'not photoshopped' and that paranormal forces could be at work. 'I'm not saying it's anything - just that it looks an awful lot like disembodied boots and legs...' 'Obiaruf ' told users. Scroll down for video . A trick of the light or paranormal forces at play? There is chatter online about what the cause of this apparent black boot apparition is . Eerie: A pair of black boots are clearly seen behind the little girl - even though her photographer father apparently does not recall a person standing there . The Reddit user who posted the controversial image online suggested they could be samurai boots - although others are not so sure . He then suggested they appeared to be 'samurai boots to me'. 'I know there are several very old samurai tombs nearby. 'Again, not saying that this is what is there, just that, based on preliminary research, this is my best guess...' Photographs from the same set show the little girl with nothing behind her and the snapper 'swears' there was nothing behind her at the time. In this picture from the same set, no one appears to be standing behind this little girl . However, in this other picture, the black boots have returned . Another conspirator suggested they could be combat boots from the World War II era. 'My grandfather was in the pacific theater (Okinawa Japan) in WWII and I recognize what the man in the background is wearing. Its a US Navy Uniform from WWII.' But not everyone was so convinced by the tricky picture. Some users suggested it was likely an optical illusion - a trick of the light - or the presence of a real-life human being. Or both. 'Looks like a living person in boots and dark pants and a light blue, possibly denim colored shirt,' said Jack_Shid. Sceptics have noted the presence of a blue piece of fabric lingering behind the little girl . 'Because of the perspective, the rest of the person is hidden behind the girl . Last month, a chilling image emerged on the 'Toowoomba Ghost Chasers' Facebook past, with its owner claiming it showed the ghost on a young drowning victim. The photograph, which was taken in 2014, was posted on Facebook by Australian Kim Davison, from Queensland. Social media users are claiming that the white shape at the back of the image, circled, shows a ghostly face . Photo was taken at Murphy's Hole which is the same location 13-year-old Doreen O'Sullivan drowned in 1915 . Was it Doreen O'Sullivan' ghost? Ms Davison claims her daughter's leg was grabbed by something in the water . The image appeared to show two women and four children swimming at Murphy's Hole in the Lockyer River, south-east Queensland. But Ms Davison and Jessie Lu, the other adult in the photo, were adamant they were only accompanied by three children. It provoked fierce discussion online after it was revealed a little girl had died in the watering hole a century prior. A Brisbane Courier newspaper clipping from November 22 1913 included a death notice for a little girl who died in that watering hole. 'Doreen O Sullivan, aged 13 years, eldest daughter of Mr. James O'Sullivan was accidentally drowned whilst bathing in the Lockyer Creek on Friday afternoon,' the notice read. 'Nearly an hour elapsed, before the body was recovered. The spot, which has always been considered dangerous, is known as Murphy's Hole, and is over 20 foot deep. Ms Davison insisted: 'At the time of taking this photo there was nothing between us. 'I'm holding the little girl and that white head next to me with horns is not human, I can promise you that. 'Its fingers are on my shoulder and on my daughter's arm. They are long skeletal type fingers.' An admin from the Toowoomba Ghost Chasers Facebook page posted a negative version of the image, saying: 'Light flare will always show up as black shadowing when the photo is inverted.. and in this case the light flare is coming from full sunlight reflecting off the water onto the child' Tragic Doreen O'Sullivan was only 13 when she accidentally drowned in the swimming hole in 1915 . Disturbingly, Ms Davison claims that there had been strange occurrences that day as they swam in the water, which only firms her belief that a spirit was present. 'On this day my daughter had her leg grabbed two times by something in the water.' 'When I went back in for one last dip to cool off I did feel something behind me as I was walking out of water but tried to ignore it. Ms Davison was convinced the shadowy visage in the photograph was Doreen O'Sullivan's photograph. A sceptic responded to Ms Davison's claims, pointing out another possibility. 'The eye sees what it wants to see. In my opinion, it's nothing more than a splash of water,' wrote Max Meara. 'Notice the child facing away from the camera - their left arm has just surfaced, causing a splash.' Brad Glynn had another explanation: 'I think it is another kid just the sun is over exposed more on the face as they are facing the sun.' The 'Toowoomba Ghost Chasers' Facebook page administrators were not convinced by either explanation. 'We used to swim there all the time growing up and all I can say is just to be safe I'm never swimming there again!' they wrote. Ms Davison posted the photo on the Toowoomba Ghost Chasers Facebook page . The administrators were shocked by the photo, writing 'We used to swim there all the time growing up and all I can say is just to be safe I'm never swimming there again!' Ms Davison claims that two paranormal experts looked at the photograph and after extensive investigation came to the conclusion that the shape in the image is a child who drowned in the river in 1915 . Ms Davison was also of the opinion that the figure in the photo was a demon who tried to take her daughter . The spot, which has always been considered dangerous, is known as Murphy's Hole, and is over 20 foot deep .
A federal judge on Thursday ordered California's corrections department to provide a transsexual convicted murderer with sex change surgery, the first time such an operation has been ordered in the state. According to the spokeswoman for the federal receiver, who controls California prison medical care, the surgery could cost taxpayers as much as $100,000. U.S. District Court Judge Jon Tigar in San Francisco ruled that denying sex reassignment surgery to 51-year-old Michelle-Lael Norsworthy violates her constitutional rights. Right to be a woman:  U.S. District Court Judge Jon Tigar in San Francisco ruled that denying sex reassignment surgery to  Michelle-Lael Norsworthy, 51,  pictured last year, violates her constitutional rights . Her birth name is Jeffrey Bryan Norsworthy. Norsworthy has been in prison since 1987, serving a life sentence for second-degree murder. She has twice delayed her scheduled parole hearings in recent months. The ruling says it would be the second time nationwide that such a surgery has been performed on an inmate, an apparent reference to an inmate who castrated himself in Texas then was given the surgery out of necessity. Norsworthy has lived as a woman since the 1990s and has what Tigar termed severe gender dysphoria. 'The weight of the evidence demonstrates that for Norsworthy, the only adequate medical treatment for her gender dysphoria is SRS,' Tigar wrote, referring to sex reassignment surgery. He found that the decision by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to deny the procedure was medically unacceptable under the circumstances. Corrections officials said they are considering whether to appeal the ruling. Attorneys for Norsworthy did immediately comment. Paid surgery: Michelle-Lael Norsworthy has been living as a woman since the 1990s and her birth name is Jeffrey Bryan Norsworthy. 'This would be a first for California, said Joyce Hayhoe, a spokeswoman for the federal receiver who controls California prison medical care. The cost to taxpayers for such surgery is uncertain, she said. 'It's several tens of thousands of dollars, possibly close to $100,000, depending on the circumstances. But It's hard to estimate,' Hayhoe said. Corrections officials, in previous court filings, argued that Norsworthy has received proper medical and mental health care for more than 15 years and is in no immediate medical danger if the surgery is not performed. Her care has included counseling, mental health treatment and hormone therapy that the department said 'has changed her physical appearance and voice to that of a woman' while helping her find her gender identity. That care is consistent with what other judges nationwide have found to be appropriate for transgender inmates, the department said. She currently is housed at Mule Creek State Prison, an all-male prison in Ione, 40 miles southeast of Sacramento. The sex change surgery will prompt practical problems, the department said. The department also said keeping Norsworthy in a men's prison could invite violence, including possible assault and rape. But she could also face danger at a women's prison — or pose a threat herself — because she had a history of domestic violence before her murder conviction, the department said. Possible danger of rape: She currently is housed at Mule Creek State Prison, an all-male prison in Ione, 40 miles southeast of Sacramento and there are fears she may be raped when becoming a woman .
As any parent will know, children's feet will often grow faster than it is possible to buy them new shoes to keep them shod. However, one charity has come up with an innovative new type of shoe that grows with a child's feet. The Shoe that Grows uses adjustable buckles and a strap on the toe to expand by five sizes. Scroll down for video . The Shoe that Grows (pictured) has adjustable points at the front, sides and the back of the sandal to help it expand. Kenton Lee, from Nampa, Idaho, came up with the idea while working in Nairobi in Kenya after seeing children running around barefoot and in shoes several sizes too small . Kenton Lee, from Nampa, Idaho, came up with the idea while working in Nairobi in Kenya after seeing children running around barefoot and in shoes several sizes too small. He said: 'It got me asking questions and finally all these questions led to an idea - what if there were a shoe that could adjust and expand? Self-tying shoelaces could become a reality after engineers designed a shoe that can automatically lace up, adjusting itself to the shape of your foot. Pressure sensors in the shoe tell it when your foot is in position, triggering a tiny motor in the heel that pulls the laces tight. When you want to take off the shoes, click your heels together twice and the motor will release a spring in the shoe’s tongue, loosening the laces so the footwear can be slipped off. The ingenious invention even runs on power generated by the swing of your foot as you walk. 'What if we had a pair of shoes where they could just adjust their shoes any time their feet grow. 'That way they will always have a pair of shoes that always fit. 'I really feel that we have created something incredible.' Children's feet grow incredibly quickly with those aged between two and six years old going up a size almost every few months. For those living in the wealthy developed countries, this can be a burden on their parent's wallets. However, for those living in developing countries where buying new shoes every few months is not an option, the risk of running around barefoot can be severe. Children can cut their feet and get infections while they can also pick up parasites like worms through their skin. The Shoe that Grows, which resembles a typical sandal, has a tough compressed rubber sole to protect the wearer's feet, with a soft leather upper. The shoe can expand five sizes by adjusting the straps at the front and back and the poppers on the sides (pictured). It currently comes in two different size ranges - small and large and a single pair costs $30 (£20) but buying 100 pairs reduces the cost to $12 (£8) The shoe has a tough rubber sole and a leather upper that is designed to last five years, the maker say. Poppers on the side allow the width to be adjusted as the child's feet expand while a strap on the toe can be moved to make the shoe longer.A buckle on the back also can be ajusted to help make the shoes fit better . Poppers on the size allow the width to be adjusted as the child's feet expand while a strap on the toe can be moved to make the shoe longer. A buckle on the back also can be adjusted to help make the shoes fit better. Mr Lee said the shoes were designed to grow five sizes and last five years. They currently come in two different size ranges - small, which is designed for children from Kindergarten age up to 4th grade - and large which is for children from 5th grade to 9th grade. A single pair costs $30 but buying 100 pairs reduces the cost to $12. Mr Lee is working with an organisation called Because International which aims to send the shoes to orphanages in Africa. They are hoping that other charities and health workers will take shoes out with them when they visit areas to hand out to children . Mr Lee is working with an organisation called Because International which aims to send the shoes to orphanages in Africa. They are hoping that other charities and health workers will take shoes out with them when they visit areas to hand out to children. Mr Lee had been working with 140 Aids orphans at the Motherly Care Children's Home in Nairobi, Kenya, when he had the idea for the shoe. He said: 'I'll never forget it. One day I was walking down a road with a group of kids from an orphanage where I was staying. 'Next to me there was a girl in a white dress. As I looked down her shoes were so small and as I looked around there were so many other kids with shoes that were too small for them.'
Housing chiefs have been were accused of hypocrisy for opposing plans to revive Margaret Thatcher’s flagship right-to-buy policy. The pledge to extend the dream of home ownership to 1.3million social tenants was the centrepiece of Tuesday’s Tory manifesto launch. But housing associations responded furiously – with one board member lambasting the proposal as the ‘right to steal’. There were even threats of a legal challenge, potentially under European human rights laws. Jane Ashcroft (left) the Anchor housing association boss is reported to earn £332,000 a year while David Bennett (right) of the Sanctuary Group is said to earn £314,000 a year . Jane Ashcroft's modern detached home (left) in the Midlands was bought for £750,000 in 2005 while David Bennett's detached farmhouse (right) in rural Herefordshire was bought for £295,000 in 2003 . But the bosses of housing associations, which are not for profit, were themselves in the dock after details emerged of their lavish salaries. Eighty pocket more than Mr Cameron’s salary of £142,500. One – David Cowans of Places for People – takes home an astonishing £432,928, including bonuses. Five others are on £250,000-plus. Bob Neill, a Tory Party vice chairman, said: ‘It’s a bit rich coming from chief executives who are lining their pockets with six-figure salaries. ‘Everyone should have the opportunity to buy their own home. ‘Right to buy has already helped around two million families realise their dream of owning their own home – and by extending it, we’ll give even more hardworking people the chance to move on and up the housing ladder.’ The housing associations said it was wrong that they should be forced to sell their homes at a discount. The National Housing Federation, the trade body for the organisations, pledged to fight the proposals ‘every step of the way’. And Rev Richard Coles, a vicar and BBC broadcaster who sits on the board of Wellingborough Homes, a small housing association in Northamptonshire, launched a furious attack on Twitter. ‘So a housing association, like the one on whose board I sit, goes to the market, raises finance, does deals with contractors and builds urgently needed units for people to live in at social rents and then the government forces us to sell them off at a 35 per cent discount. That’s right to buy? Sounds like right to steal to me.’ Simon Dow (left) of the Guinness Partnership is said to earn £264,000 a year while Darrell Mercer (right) is reported to earn £247,000 a year . Simon Dow' townhouse (left) in trendy North London has an estimated value of £750,000 while Darrell Mercer's five bed-room semi-detached townhouse (right) in West London was bought for £732,500 in 2006 . The policy director of the National Housing Federation, Ruth Davison, a Labour party member in Islington, said it was wrong to hand money to ‘some of the most securely-housed people in the country on some of the lowest rents’. She told the BBC: ‘We are independent organisations and charities – you can no more force a housing association to sell their assets at less than they’re worth than you can force Tesco, or even Cancer Research. ‘So housing associations would have to be fully recompensed for any sale. There will be a cost to the taxpayer.’ Council house tenants in England can already buy their home at a discount of up to £103,900. The Tories would extend this to 800,000 housing association tenants who now have limited purchase rights and to 500,000 who have no rights at all. Around 2.7million people live in these properties. The subsidies would be funded by making councils sell their more costly properties once they become vacant. Every house purchased would be replaced ‘on a one-for-one basis’. Unveiling the policy in Swindon, Mr Cameron said: ‘Part of having a good life is having a home of your own. It’s not about assets and appreciating values – it’s about someone standing there with their keys in their hand thinking “this place is mine”. ‘The next Conservative government will extend the right to buy to all housing association tenants in this country. That’s 1.3million extra families – a whole new generation given the security of a home. The pledge to extend the dream of home ownership to 1.3million social tenants was the centrepiece of Tuesday’s Tory manifesto launch . ‘So let the message ring out from this generation of Conservatives: you’ve worked hard, you’ve saved, the home you live in, it’s yours to buy, yours to own. ‘The dream of a property-owning democracy is alive – and we will fulfil it.’ The plan was welcomed by Paula Higgins, chief executive of the HomeOwners Alliance, who said: ‘The overwhelming majority of British people of all backgrounds want to own their own home, rather than rent them.’ Tony Stacey, of South Yorkshire Housing Association, said last month that he would definitely launch a challenge. ‘This is so fundamentally critical to us,’ he said. ‘It would shoot up to the top of our risk map if it was confirmed. We are duty bound morally to fight it in any way we possibly can.’ Industry sources believe the plans could fall foul of charity law, because housing associations are generally prohibited from selling off their assets at below market value. One lawyer said it might even breach article 1, protocol 1, of the European Convention on Human Rights, which grants the ‘right to the peaceful enjoyment of one’s possessions’. ‘I can’t see how this could get through the legal system. It’s completely reckless,’ said Richard Murphy, of Tax Research LLP. Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg said the right-to-buy pledge showed the Tories had ‘run out of ideas’, adding that it was just ‘a poor cover version of one of Margaret Thatcher’s 1980s hits’. Housing association chief executives whose salaries have been revealed by Inside Housing magazine include Jane Ashcroft of Anchor who was on a package of £332,316 in 2013/14. Four others were: David Bennett of Sanctuary Group, who was on £314,416; Keith Exford of Affinity Sutton (£289,088); Simon Dow of the Guinness Partnership (£264,000); and Darrell Mercer of the A2 Dominion Group (£247,000). A study by the GMB union found that two out of five council houses sold in Wandsworth, south-west London, in the 1980s, are now owned by private landlords, who rent them to tenants. It said reviving the policy would benefit private landlords.
The French state railway company on Monday demanded police action against 'irresponsible' Paris-Roubaix cycle race riders who breached a safety barrier seconds before a high speed train hurtled by. The SNCF company made an official complaint to French prosecutors saying the action in Sunday's prestigious race had risked a deadly tragedy. The last of the riders went through the barrier in northern France about eight seconds before the TGV train arrived at the Waller crossing, 87 kilometers (54 miles) from the end of the so called 'Hell of the North' race. SNCF have spoken of their fury at the riders who breached a safety barrier as a train approached . SNCF slammed the riders for an 'extremely grave an irresponsible action' One rider was even clipped by the barrier as it came down, as the racers hurry through with the train near . Another cyclist made his way over the track after police tried to stop anymore competitors getting across . A number of riders wait safely for the train to pass through while others risked crossing . The train hurtled through at high speed shortly after a group of riders went through the barrier . One rider from the Belgian Lotto team was clipped by a barrier as it came down. John Degenkolb, winner of the race famed for its 26 sections of bone-jarring cobbled roads, was among the group who went through the barrier as it closed. Race organisers said it had not been possible for the leaders to stop in time. 'Several riders deliberately, and against all safety rules, crossed a closed safety barrier,' said a SNCF statement announcing the complaint to French prosecutors. 'Millions of television viewers saw live this extremely grave and irresponsible action which could have been tragic,' the company added. 'A few seconds later, a TGV ran on this line and could have hit the peloton.' When the last rider had gone through the crossing, a police motorcycle was in place to stop more riders going through. The riders are held at a level crossing in the Paris-Roubaix race as a train approaches . A number of cyclists breached the barrier to cross the track before the train sped through . The last cyclist appeared to cross the track around eight seconds before the train went through . Normally riders who go through a closed safety crossing are disqualified. But Guy Dobbelaere, president of the jury of race commissioners, defended the action of the riders on Sunday. 'It wasn't possible for the leading riders to stop sufficiently safely,' said Dobbelaere. 'The peloton was 10 metres away when the barrier started to close.' Race director Thierry Gouvenou added: 'By neutralising the race for a few moments to not penalise those who stopped, we respected the spirit of the rule. 'In theory, those who pass when the barrier is down are thrown out of the race. 'This time, that would have been unjust in respect of those riders who weren't identified,' said Gouvenou. German John Degenkolb won the race and was one of the riders who went through the closed barrier . Degenkolb celebrates his win alongside Zdenek Stybar (left) and Greg van Avermaet (right) Race officials slowed the leading riders so that those held up by the barrier could catch up. In 2006, three riders were disqualified for going through a closed railway crossing. The three - Leif Hoste and Peter van Petegem of Belgium and Russian Vladimir Guseve - were less than 10 kilometers (six miles) from the finish and had been disputing top places.
It is just 12 weeks since bold claims were emanating from an ultra-confident Dundee United dressing room that this season could yield an unprecedented domestic Treble. ‘I believe we can win all three trophies,’ trumpeted goalkeeper Radoslaw Cierzniak. ‘People might laugh at me but maybe in May we will have won the league and cups and I will be laughing.’ On Wednesday night against Dundee at Dens Park, however, those carefree early January days seemed so long ago as Cierzniak’s grip of the ball for Greg Stewart’s opening goal proved as tight as his grasp on footballing reality. Dundee United manager Jackie McNamara is under pressure following his side's recent slump . Dundee United failed to get their hands on the Scottish League Cup  as they fell to a 2-0 defeat by Celtic . Scottish Premiership outfit Dundee United have failed to win any of their last 10 games . As United slumped to a first derby defeat in 11 years, the loss at Dens Park saw Jackie McNamara’s team make it 10 matches without a win. It’s not yet May but nobody is laughing at Tannadice as the club gets to grips with an implosion of cataclysmic proportions both on and off the park. It does seem a touch bizarre that all is not well at a club that has reached back-to-back domestic cup finals for the first time in 29 years; qualified for European competition in three of the last four years; finished in the Premiership top six in every one of the last seven years and won the Scottish Cup in 2010. Yet as United have dropped like a stone from early-season table-toppers to potentially even missing out on Europe, the fallout has come amid an increasingly acrid war of words surrounding revelations about McNamara’s entitlement to a cut from outgoing player sales. Those close to Tannadice speak of a series of damaging schisms developing on all sides between fans, board and manager; cumulatively casting increased uncertainty over McNamara’s future. Ahead of the annual general meeting of influential supporters’ group ArabTRUST, one leading fan told Sportsmail of ‘overwhelming unhappiness’ with McNamara’s bonus, while his recruitment and tactical nous are also being questioned. There is, he added, a growing belief among fans that the manager’s position is ‘untenable’. But this has been a slow-burning civil war. The seeds of the crisis that appear to have taken place at almost every level of the club were first sown at the end of the winter transfer window when chairman Stephen Thompson took the unpopular decision to sell star players Stuart Armstrong and Gary Mackay-Steven to Celtic. As furious fans pointed out, hadn’t Thomson used the eve of last May’s Scottish Cup Final defeat by St Johnstone to declare Tannadice finances to be their finest since 1986 and vow there would be no player exodus, as occurred after the Scottish Cup win in 2010 under Peter Houston? Dundee United sold Stuart Armstrong (left) to Celtic during the January transfer window . Gary Mackay-Steven also sealed a winter move to Celtic on transfer deadline day . The Tannadice supremo even went as far as name-checking Armstrong along with Ryan Gauld and Andrew Robertson as players he would like to keep for ‘at least another year’ to help ‘compete’ with Celtic. Gauld and Robertson were quickly sold for £3million each last summer, although the fees for both made the sales palatable. Yet parting with Armstrong and Mackay-Steven just 48 hours after reaching a League Cup Final against a Celtic side Thompson had vowed to ‘compete’ with proved particularly painful for the rank and file. ‘I thought it was a strange decision, I must admit,’ said former United defender and BBC analyst Mark Wilson recently. ‘I can understand letting Mackay-Steven go because he had signed a pre-contract with Celtic but Armstrong is a different case. ‘United were in touching distance of Celtic and if you are serious about challenging, then you can sell him in June. ‘I read McNamara saying he wanted to keep both players but that they needed to balance the books. But they sold Gauld and Robertson for substantial fees in the summer and I read the chairman talking about how great the club’s finances are. ‘It was just a bit odd. Especially selling to Celtic, a rival, rather than an English team.’ At first, United closed ranks to slap down their detractors, reacting with an almost weary derision to anyone questioning the wisdom of selling key players at such a crucial part of the season. Dundee United striker Ryan Dow has scored just two league goals during the course of the current season . Dundee United striker Nadir Ciftci celebrated a goal by blowing a kiss at opposition goalkeeper Scott Bain . After starting life post-Armstrong and Mackay-Steven with a comprehensive 3-0 Scottish Cup victory at Stranraer, the line spun was that the two players, while talented, did not constitute a two-man team. They were at pains to point out that as United stormed to the top of the Premiership at the start of the season, Armstrong was often injured while an off-form Mackay-Steven was regularly left on the bench. Indeed, it was argued that, together, the duo started just three of United’s first nine games of the campaign, of which McNamara’s side won seven, drew one and lost one. After that Stair Park victory, two-goal Ryan Dow was hailed as the man to step into Armstrong and Mackay-Steven’s goalscoring boots. Dow has not hit the net since. Worryingly, United then slumped to their first back-to-back defeats of the season and went on to lose the League Cup Final to Celtic. Bain refuses to react as the Turkish striker does his best to rile his rival goalkeeper at Den Park . Turkish forward Ciftci celebrates with a kiss but ends up blushing as his side lose derby match . Jake McPake wheels away in celebration as helps Dundee earn first derby win in over a decade . Over the course of four March meetings with Ronny Deila’s men, United were dispatched from the Scottish Cup and defeated in the league, too, as McNamara’s season started to disintegrate. As the heat rose on Thompson, the United chairman first admitted the sales were a wrong footballing decision but correct from a financial standpoint. Curiously, though, the spotlight would then eventually turn on McNamara as ArabTRUST and the Federation of Dundee United Supporters’ Clubs released a statement saying they were shocked 25 per cent of £6.3m worth of transfer fees for Gauld, Robertson, Armstrong and Mackay-Steven were paid in commission to unnamed parties. United continue to deny the figures in question but eventually made the bombshell confirmation that McNamara was indeed entitled to a cut of player transfers. Even if it was done with the best of intentions — to reduce the manager’s salary in straitened times while bumping his earnings up if successful in developing young talent to sell — the revelation was toxic in the eyes of many fans. Their new-found ire towards a manager who led them to two consecutive finals has been further roused by United losing five-in-a-row for the first time since May 2006. Amid this poor run, St Johnstone defender Frazer Wright recently claimed that if McNamara’s men fall behind, ‘it gets in their heads’ and they ‘argue amongst themselves’. Dundee Utd goalkeeper Radoslaw Cierzniak looks back at his goal after Mark Stewart opened the scoring . Stewart celebrates his derby goal with a fan as he runs over to the home faithful at Den Park . Defeat at Tannadice against hapless Hamilton — without a win in 12 games — is now rendered unthinkable, even if victory would clinch a top-six finish for city rivals Dundee. There are those within Dens Park who sense a real opportunity to become the first Dark Blues side to finish above United in the league since 2002-03. A loss, coupled with a win for on-form Dundee at St Johnstone, would see Paul Hartley’s men go above United in the table on Saturday. Few could have guessed that scenario when, in the first hours of 2015, United took Dundee apart in a record 6-2 derby win at Tannadice. Not least Paul Heffernan, who, as a Hibs player, was impressed by United in a thrilling 3-3 draw at Easter Road in the League Cup in October before McNamara’s side sneaked through on penalties. ‘I’m sure the fans would love us to finish above United — and it’s all to play for,’ said the Irish striker, who scored the third in Dundee’s 3-1 win at Dens on Wednesday night. ‘We’re only two points behind United now, so we’ve just got to keep going when the split comes. Dundee United's Chris Erskine goes down under a challenge from Stephen McGinn during the Dundee derby . Dundee's Paul Heffernan taps home his side's third goal of the game as they close in on derby victory . ‘I’m surprised that they have gone 10 games without a win. When I was still at Hibs earlier this season, we played them in the League Cup and they were a very good side. ‘It’s a long time not to win but they’ve still got very good players in the team. I’m sure they will come good again. ‘I’d actually like it if they came good against Hamilton on Saturday, though. That would be perfect because it would cement our place in the top-six. ‘So here’s hoping they can turn it around on Saturday because it would help us. It would be ironic, I know, if United clinched us a top-six place. ‘But we go to St Johnstone knowing we are definitely in the top six if we win there.’ While the tangerine half of Dundee mourns its fall from grace, the Dark Blues are in raptures after breaking a sequence of derbies without victory stretching back to November 2004. ‘Ending that run against United was a big motivating factor — and I felt that was the best I’ve seen us play,’ said Heffernan. ‘A lot of the players haven’t been here that long. But, for the sake of the fans who haven’t witnessed a win over United for such a long time, it was really important. We did it for them. I’m sure they will enjoy this one for a long time to come.’ After a long era in the shadow of their neighbours, Dundee are daring to dream. Amid a tangerine nightmare, however, for a United side in crisis, the Treble that once lay ahead has been replaced by trouble.
My first trip to New York was with my aunt when I was about 18 and I had been appearing in Coronation Street for about 12 months. I can remember it all so clearly. We had a lot of fun together - we went to see the musical Chicago on Broadway and did lots and lots of shopping. We returned to the city that never sleeps in January 2001, eight months before the terrible events of 9/11, and one of the first things my boyfriend Sylvain Longchambon and I did on my latest trip was to visit the site of the World Trade Center to see the monument to those who died. It was a very poignant moment. Coronation Street star Samia Ghadie and boyfriend Sylvain Longchambon take a selfie in New York . There were hundreds of people visiting the memorial at the time but everybody was quiet and extremely respectful. Sylvain and I flew to the US from Manchester and spent four nights in the city. I love flying from Manchester if I can, not just because it's nearer to my home but because it's not so vast and sprawling as either Gatwick or Heathrow. We stayed at the Marriott where the service was fantastic - when we checked in the concierge desk wanted to know if they could help us to make bookings for shows or restaurants. And when we got to the room, we were met by a butler who immediately took away our shoes for shining - very impressive. You don't get that at a Travelodge! We had a beautiful suite on the 31st floor, giving us panoramic views of Central Park. We valued the fact that the suite had a separate lounge area, and it came in really handy because during our stay Sylvain's cousin in New York celebrated his 30th birthday, so lots of people came back to our room for a glass of bubbly. We sipped champagne as we gazed out across Manhattan - and The Rovers Return suddenly felt a very long way away. The JW Marriott Essex House as seen from Central Park, of which it boasts panoramic views . One of Samia and Sylvain's first stops was to pay their respects to those lost on September 11, 2001 . On the second night of our break, we went on the Bateaux New York cruise, which offers an unforgettable three-hour trip along the Hudson River. We enjoyed cocktails and then a great three-course meal, and after that there was music and dancing. You can go outside on deck where you have amazing views of Manhattan. Actually we only just made the cruise by the skin of our teeth. President Obama was in New York to address the United Nations and as we were in a taxi heading for the pier to board the cruise, we discovered that the police had closed a lot of the streets to let the President's motorcade through. With the clock ticking and our yellow cab going nowhere, we decided to get out and find the nearest subway station. Once our train reached its destination, we had to dash to get to the cruise boat, but fortunately we just made it on time. I'm so glad we did because to see Manhattan like that was an unforgettable experience. The couple, who met as partners on Dancing on Ice, enjoyed a Bateaux New York Cruise of the Hudson . The bright lights and busy traffic of Fifth Avenue which Samia covered extensively during her four-day trip . During our break, we saw most of the famous sights, including the Statue of Liberty, where we took some great pictures. We didn't manage to catch a show, though - we simply ran out of time. We wanted to have a juicy steak at a proper New York steakhouse. Friends had told us about a place called Burger Joint in Le Parker Meridien Hotel - it doesn't look very special (in fact, there's graffiti all over the walls outside) but it's reckoned to serve the best burgers in town. I have to agree they're pretty special. It was Sylvain's first visit to New York and he absolutely loved it. He also enjoyed the shopping. We must have covered the whole of Fifth Avenue during our stay, and yes, purchases were made. I have to confess I bought a few dresses. The pound was very good value against the dollar at the time, so there were a lot of bargains to be had. I calculated that many things were half the price compared with the UK - so how could I resist? While Samia shopped at famed New York stores such as Tiffany and Co, Sylvain worked out in the gym . For bargain shopping, Samia recommends discount outlet store Century 21 for lots of major brands . Sylvain wasn't always my shopping buddy. He chose to remain at the hotel a few times and work out at the gym. So while I was at Tiffany's he was on the running machine. A crowd of paparazzi turned out to be for Lady Gaga, but sadly a selfie with the pop star wasn't an option . Despite our world renown as an ice-dancing couple - we met while we were partners on the ITV show Dancing On Ice - we managed to resist the lure of the rink at the Rockefeller Centre. For Sylvain, ice skating is too much like work. I still skate from time to time and I have to say I'm a lot better at it than I was on the programme. I think that's because I'm just doing it for fun now and there's no pressure on me. If anybody is looking for good shopping, I can recommend BCBG - it's great for dresses, and their prices are excellent. If you're after big savings, head to Century 21, which is like an outlet store for lots of major brands. Friends had told us about it before we travelled to New York. I'm glad they did because the prices were so temptingly low. And of course I also made sure to visit the Disney Store to get presents for my little girl - we were loaded up with bags from there, much to her delight, when we returned to England. Perhaps the biggest surprise of the trip was when we had stopped to have lunch at a small Italian restaurant on Central Park near our hotel . While we were eating, we noticed a crowd gathering - with lots of paparazzi photographers. We were wondering who was going to emerge when out stepped Lady Gaga. It was the ultimate holiday treat - it was just a shame I couldn't arrange a selfie with her. That would have been the icing on the cake. American Sky (0843 636 2001) offers a three-night holiday to New York from £899pp. This includes accommodation in the JW Marriott Essex House New York on a room-only basis and return flights with British Airways from Heathrow.

It has been revealed the blue-eyed, Australian doctor who's been hailed the 'new face' of the latest Islamic State propaganda videos was reportedly a 'womaniser' who was thought to be a 'pretty normal guy'. In  ISIS's most recent video, a young doctor, identified as Tareq Kamleh, called on foreign medics to travel to the ISIS stronghold in Raqqa to help launch the ISHS (the Islamic State Health Service). The video of Kamleh, who refers to himself as Abu Yusuf, showed him handling babies in a maternity ward while wearing western-style blue surgical scrubs and a stethoscope. Scroll down for video . The blue-eyed Australian doctor who features in the latest IS propaganda video has been identified as Tareq Kamleh . Calling himself 'Abu Yusuf', Kamleh introduces the launch of the Islamic State Health Service . Once the propaganda video went viral, people from Kamleh's past started to recognise the previously unidentified doctor. It was revealed Kamleh, who is believed to be in his late 20's, completed his medical degree at Adelaide University. Upon completing his degree he reportedly worked as a paediatric registrar at the Adelaide Women's and Children's Hospital until 2013. Kamleh then moved to north Queensland where he worked at Mackay Base Hospital, the Age reported. He completed his final stint in the Australian medical system working in Perth until late 2014. It was revealed Kamleh, who is believed to be in his late 20's, completed his medical degree at Adelaide University . 'He was a pretty normal guy, he didn't have any IS related interests' A university student who knew Kamleh, but did not want to be named, said he showed no signs that he would defect to the radical militant group. 'He was a pretty normal guy, he didn't have any IS related interests,' she told news.com.au. She said the 'clean cut' doctor was well known in her social circle as a 'womaniser' who didn't shy away from drinking alcohol. Kamleh was also recognised by Dr Stephen Napoli, co-owner of the Mannum Medical Centre in South Australia. He told the Age the 'intelligent' doctor had interned with him for 10 weeks back in 2010. 'As a doctor he worked quite well; he was quite intelligent, he presented to our practice as quite a sound doctor with good medical knowledge,' Dr Napoli said. 'As a doctor he worked quite well; he was quite intelligent, he presented to our practice as quite a sound doctor with good medical knowledge' Kamleh was known to practice medicine in Adelaide, Mackay and finally in Perth before he took up working for IS . Dr Napoli agreed that Kamleh had shown no signs of holding extreme Islamic views. 'There was no indication I'd be worried about his other associations when he was with us. 'There was nothing that I saw of his work as a medical practical that would suggest he would have any of these sorts of views.' The video's poster shows a cropped image of a doctor, wearing an western-style blue surgical scrubs which appear to mimic Britain's National Health Service . A former college from Adelaide Hospital also came forward reporting that he recognised Kamleh in the footage immediately. 'I was taken aback as much because I certain certainly wouldn't have associated him with an association like IS. His principle seemed to be sound and focused on the care of his patients,' he told the Age. The collegue, who also chose not to be identified, said Kamleh's behaviours were not consistent with the Islamic State's conservative views on drinking or dating. 'I know he dated a few nurses and other doctors over the years… he was heterosexual and certainly interested in the ladies, with some success.' Yusuf  is shown monitoring and handling babies in a maternity unit as well as teaching another doctor how to care for the infant patients . The video featuring Kamleh, which is the latest in a string of high budget propaganda videos from the depraved militant group, shows the doctor interviewed inside the paediatric ward of a Syrian hospital. 'My name is Abu Yusuf. I made hijrah from Australia to the Islamic State to live under the khilafah,' he says. 'I saw this as part of my jihad for Islam, to help the Muslim Ummah (community) in the area that I could which is the medical field.' He claims to be sad he delayed travelling to Syria for so long. 'It is disappointing to think how many fellow Muslims brothers and sisters in the medical field, who are doctors and nurses, physios, who are still living in the West and unfortunately the Muslims living here are suffering, not necessary from a lack of equipment or medicine but a mainly a lack of qualified medical care.' The vision is the latest in a string of high budget propaganda videos from the depraved militant group . Yusuf urges foreign Muslims with medical training to come forward and join the latest caliphate initiative. 'We really need your help. It is not the equipment that we are lacking, it is truly just the staff. Inshallah see you soon.' Australian National University terrorism expert Dr Clarke Jones confirmed the authenticity of the video to Daily Mail Australia. 'I'm familiar with IS propaganda and this is certainly legit,' he said. Abu Yusuf al-Australi calls upon foreigners with medical training to join the Islamic State's new medical initiative . 'The video is interesting because it's trying to communicate a sense of normalcy within the caliphate. The babies, ambulances and modern medical equipment are a far cry from the barbarity of their other videos.' 'In reality, the conditions are not accurate: Syria remains a very hostile environment. But it communicates a major shift in their recruitment.' Dr Jones believes the group are trying to attract more sophisticated demographic than in the past, when they targeted disillusioned youths. 'They are asking for foreigners with medical training and an education, and they aren't trying to lure them for militant purposes. This poses an interesting question: is this still considered radicalisation?' Nine British medical students have travelled to Syria to work in hospitals in Islamic State-held areas. Pictured from left to right: Hisham Mohammed Fadlallah, Lena Maumoon Abdulqadir and Tamer Ahmed Ebu Sebah . The four women and five men apparently kept their plans secret from their families and fled to Syria .             Left to right: Rowan Kamal Zine El Abidine, Sami Ahmed Kadir and Ismail Hamadoun . The medical students are believed to now be in the ISIS-held area of Tel Abyad,                                                    From left to right: Nada Sami Kader, Mohamed Osama Badri Mohammed and Tasneem Suleyman . The footage, which appeared on social media on Thursday, comes after nine Brritish medical students travelled to Syria last month, claiming they were going to help treat victims of the civil war. The students are all believed to be of Sudanese origin and were studying at a medical school in Khartoum, Sudan. The students have been named as Lena Mamoun Abdelgadir, Nada Sami Kader, Rowan Kamal Zine El Abidine, Tasneem Suleyman Huseyin, Ismail Hamdoun, Tamer Ahmed Ebu Sebah, Mohammed Osama Badri Mohammed, Hisham Mohammed Fadlallah and Sami Ahmed Kadir. In February, Australia's Attorney-General George Brandis announced an $18 million initiative to battle extremist propaganda. The operation, which will be launched in July, will employ a team of technology experts to assess the impact of online extremist propaganda. The government also plans to seek the help of platforms such as Google, Twitter and Facebook, to counter extremist messages.

Appointment: Courtney Brain, 16, was taken out of lessons when she visited her GP for treatment . A straight-A schoolgirl was given a detention for missing half an hour of lessons for an emergency appointment with her GP, her mother claimed yesterday. Courtney Brain, 16, was taken out of school at Skegness Academy when she visited her GP for treatment for a water infection. But she was stunned upon her return to class in Lincolnshire to be told she must make up the missed time for the ‘unauthorised absence’. Her mother Jane Burnham, 50, criticised the ‘mind-boggling’ decision last Wednesday to punish Courtney - who she claimed has a 98 per cent attendance record, although the school put this figure at 91 per cent - and accused the Academy of being ‘petty and unreasonable'. Mrs Burnham, who runs a hotel in the town, said: ‘I was gobsmacked. My daughter has never been in trouble before. She is expected to get straight A*s in her exams and helps out after school with extracurricular activities. 'She is not a problem child, she works hard and this was the only appointment I could get. Trying to see your GP around here can be a nightmare and I’ll always try and get an appointment after school. But on this occasion she couldn’t, so you take it when you can. 'She was only out of lessons for half an hour. It wasn’t like she was round the back of the bike sheds having a cigarette or going on a shopping spree. Then it would be different. 'She had a water infection for which she needed antibiotics - and I find the decision to give her detention mind-boggling. Concern: Skegness Academy (above) in Lincolnshire claimed the detention was to give Courtney, whose mother runs a hotel in the seaside town, the best chance possible of doing well in her exams in the summer . ‘Water infections can get worse so it was important to go to the doctor as soon as she could. I think it very petty and unreasonable for her to be punished in this way. I am not happy at all. 'We were gone half an hour, that’s all she was missing. It’s mind boggling. It’s disgusting really.’ The school claimed the detention was to give Courtney the best chance possible of doing well in her exams in the summer. But Jane Mrs Burnham who runs the Carmelle Hotel with husband Trevor, 53, said she did not think the extra half-hour revision will ultimately make any difference to her overall grades. Detention: Courtney (pictured) was told she must make up the missed time for the 'unauthorised absence' She added: ‘I think the extra half an hour really would not make that much difference especially as she has already done all her coursework and practical work. GP visit: Courtney had a water infection for which she needed antibiotics last Wednesday . ‘It is just revising for her English and maths GCSE now. It is not as though she makes a habit of missing school for doctor’s appointments, it was a one off. 'Courtney’s attendance is 98 per cent, which is above what the school requires and she teaches the younger kids dance after school anyway. She was left upset by this and like she had done something really wrong.’ The girl's attendance figure was contested by the school, which insisted it was 91.2 per cent - below the national average. Principal Elizabeth Silvester said letters were sent out last month in response to a growing concern about the number of sixth-form students missing vital lessons due to medical appointments. She said: ‘As a matter of course, we request that students make any routine appointments out of school hours. 'Where this is not possible, we request that students make up any time that they have lost. ‘We want to ensure students complete all the work for their relevant subjects in order to give themselves the best chance of succeeding in their forthcoming examinations.’ Skegness Academy caters for 1,191 pupils aged 11 to 18 and was given a rating of ‘good’ by Ofsted in its last inspection in October 2012.
The new 4G mobile phone services in the UK are not as super-fast as the industry promised - and could get worse. The mobile phone companies boasted that 4G services would be ‘five times faster’ than the existing 3G networks when they launched in the autumn of 2012. However, a new official study puts the real figure at an average of 2.5 times faster - 14.7 megabits per second compared to 5.9Mbit/s per second on the 3G service that most people use. A study by Ofcom says 4G speeds in the UK are slower than promised. Mobile phone companies boasted 4G would be five times faster than 3G. But the actual figure is actually only 2.5 times faster - 14.7 megabits per second. Shown is an HTC One XL smartphone at a news conference in Zurich launching 4G in 2012 . At the same time, the evidence suggests that 4G services are likely to slow down as more people connect to them. 4G technology is being promoted by the big mobile networks on the basis it offers high speed internet access and smooth video streaming without annoying buffering. More than 10 million people have been won over by the promises and have signed two year contracts costing an average of £20 ($30) a month. The 4G speed data comes from the telecoms regulator, Ofcom, which supports the technology and insists the figures show a meaningful and significant benefit over the 3G services. Despite this, the figures make clear the step change has not been as remarkable as the major networks - EE, O2, Vodafone and Three - promised. Ofcom’s research compares the speed and geographic coverage of the networks and puts EE, which is the subject of a £12.5 billion ($18.5 billion) takeover by BT, on top. EE’s 4G network, which covers 81 per cent of homes and businesses, delivered the fastest average download speed of 18.6Mbit/s. This looks good when compared with its 3G service, which was a slow 4Mbit/s. Second fastest was Vodafone with 16.4 for 4G versus 6.6 for 3G. O2 came next at 13.9 versus 6.6, followed by Three at a relatively slow 8.5 for 4G which was not very impressive against the 5.4 for 3G. Upload speeds are important when sharing content, such as pictures and videos to social media sites like Instagram and Facebook. EE was also fastest on this measure at 17.6Mbit/s, followed by O2 on 13.2, Vodafone on 13.1 and Three with 9.4. The Three network was the fastest to load a web page at 0.63 seconds, compared to 0.71 for O2, 0.76 for Vodafone and 0.77 for EE. There is good evidence to believe the speeds offered by 4G are slowing down. When 4G services launched at the end of 2012, the average download speed was up at around 19 Mbit/s, however the new research suggests an average of 14.7 and other studies put it as low as 10. This has happened because more people are using the service, effectively causing jams on the airwaves. The only way this can be countered is if the networks spend millions upgrading masts and installing new ones. Ofcom’s research compares the speed and geographic coverage of the networks and puts EE, which is the subject of a £12.5 billion ($18.5 billion) takeover by BT, on top. EE’s 4G network, which covers 81 per cent of homes and businesses, delivered the fastest average download speed of 18.6Mbit/s . The Ofcom figures are based on 120,000 smartphone tests in five sample towns and cities - Edinburgh, Leeds, London, Newcastle and Poole/Bournemouth - between October and December. Its study found that download speeds in Edinburgh fell by 12.5 per cent between the summer and end of last year. The time to call up a web page improved marginally from 0.8 seconds to 0.72. Ofcom admitted: ‘As more people are taking 4G services from the mobile operators, this is likely to affect the average speeds being received.’ The speeds for London were unchanged over the same period, while there was no data for the other areas. Claudio Pollack, Ofcom’s Consumer Director, said the study is designed to boost competition by helping consumers decide which mobile networks are offer the best service. He said: ‘People are increasingly connected, communicating and sharing content on their mobiles when out and about. ‘4G is delivering a significantly enhanced mobile experience and, as these services roll out across the UK, our research will support consumers when choosing the right mobile package for their needs.’
Thousands of motorists have been fined or had their cars towed away after falling foul of new rules following the switch to digital tax discs. Many are buying used cars unaware that the old paper documents are now automatically cancelled when a vehicle changes hands. Ignorant that they must fork out for a new digital one – even if the existing paper disc is months from expiry – rising numbers of drivers are falling prey to clampers. Scroll down for video . Thousands of law-abiding motorists have had their cars clamped because they were unaware of major vehicle tax rule changes. File photo . Critics allege that the DVLA has been operating a 'money-making scam' after figures yesterday showed clamping soared after the paperless system was introduced in October last year. Many say the authority was too quick to penalise motorists without first warning that their car was not taxed. Drivers have faced bills of up to £800 to get their impounded vehicles back. The Government abolished the paper tax disc (pictured) last autumn . The DVLA was accused of 'heavy-handed and Draconian' behaviour yesterday after figures showed its use of clamping rocketed by 60 per cent from about 5,000 vehicles a month before the changes to 8,630 last month. With no right to appeal against the fines to an independent body, drivers have little choice but to pay up. The DVLA is estimated to be making millions of pounds a year because it receives double road tax payment – from both the seller and the buyer. Christopher and Marianna Webb, from Bridport, Dorset, were hit with an £822 bill to get their Ford Focus back after returning from holiday to find it had been impounded for non-payment of vehicle excise duty. The couple decided to swap their cars with each other and informed the DVLA of the change in ownership, without realising it meant the tax for both vehicles would be cancelled. Mr Webb, 56, told The Guardian: 'I feel they are very heavy-handed. Why did they not send a reminder letter?' Pete Hallam, whose car was also clamped, said: 'This is shady practice and reminiscent of the car parking wheel clampers a few years ago. It is a money-making scam.' Paul Watters of the AA said there had been only limited publicity from the DVLA about the changes to the vehicle tax system. 'There are a lot of people who are not aware of this – some may think they are covered because they see there is a tax disc on the windscreen,' he said. 'Clamping is quite heavy-handed and Draconian. Before they clamp they should try to get in touch with these people if they can.' A DVLA spokesman said: 'The changes have been widely publicised and we write to every vehicle keeper to remind them of the new rules before the vehicle tax expires. 'We also write to every new vehicle keeper when they buy a used vehicle to inform them that they must tax the vehicle before they use it. 'In addition, if a driver does not tax their car we will send a warning letter to remind them to tax as they are at risk of enforcement action.'
This extraordinary video - captured when a skydiver dropped his GoPro camera at 10,000ft - shows what it is like to freefall to the ground. The clip shows the very moment the helmet camera becomes detached and makes its dizzying descent back to earth. After what begins as a routine skydive - with two of the jumpers linking hands in mid-air as two companions circle them - the camera slips from helmet and makes its stomach-churning plunge to the ground. It spins quickly to the ground for a minute and a half before crashing into a field. Remarkably, the camera remains intact despite falling from the great height. The video was taken of a routine skydive in Everöd, Sweden and recorded on the helmet of one of the divers . A Go Pro video shows the skydivers linking arms as they jumped out of the plane at 10,000 feet . As two of the divers continue to link hands, their two friends circle them as they free fall from the plane . At that moment, the Go Pro camera from one of the diver's helmets becomes detached and falls to the ground . The camera was discovered by Kristoffer Örstadius's father in a meadow in Gringelstad outside Kristianstad, Sweden. It is believed the footage was taken four years ago and Kristoffer uploaded the footage in the hope of finding its owner. After posting the video to YouTube, the owner was located in Everöd, Sweden. It has amassed more than 250,000 views since it was uploaded to the site. Once detached, it whizzes to the ground - taking one and a half minutes to hit the ground . The camera continues to record as it spins out of control, and captures some dizzying footage . As the camera plummets to the earth, the footage of the free fall becomes even more blurry . Eventually, the camera crashes into the ground in thick grass - remarkably it remained intact .
Three women who were filmed twerking in front a Second World War memorial in Russia have been jailed for hooliganism. In a YouTube video, six dancers are seen performing the provocative and popular move along to music while stood in front of the Malaya Zemlya monument in Novorossiysk, southern Russia. Prosecutors said their 'erotic and sexual twerk dance' was disrespectful to those who fought in the war and jailed two of the women for ten days and a third for 15 days. Scroll down for video . 'Hooliganism': Three women have been jailed after releasing a video of their dance group twerking in front of the Malaya Zemlya monument in Novorossiysk, southern Russia . Two others escaped with fines, while another dancer avoided punishment altogether as she was under 16 - with a reprimand being handed down to her mother instead. According to the BBC, prosecutors said: 'This incident of disrespect for the memory of war history is unacceptable and any attempts to desecrate sites of military glory will be stopped immediately.' The Youtube video currently has more than 400,000 views and sees the six dancers performing a well-choreographed one and a half minute routine. After surfacing earlier this week,it was brought to the attention of the mayor of Novorossiysk, where the women are from. The mayor was said to be 'outraged' and personally charged officials with identifying the names of the performers - who posted the video to attract new recruits to their modern dance school . 'We condemn these women. Every inch of this land is covered in blood. It is inappropriate,' said Viktoriya Dikaya, the press secretary for the city's education department. Recruitment video: The one minute 30 second clip was posted by the women to encourage people to join their dance school . Punished: Two of the girls were jailed for ten days, while a third was sentenced to 15 days in prison. Two others were fined, while the sixth dancer escaped punishment as she was under 16 . Prosecutors are now said to be  carrying out checks at the institutions where the women, who were all under 30, are enrolled, to make sure they are in compliance with 'programs aimed at ensuring respect for the law among their members', reports RT.com. The Malaya Zemlya memorial, completed in 1982, commemorates a battle to free Novorossiysk from German occupation in 1943. The women's sentences come as Russia prepares to mark the 70th anniversary of the Second World War victory. The incident comes just weeks after Russian officials closed down a dance school after footage emerged of teenage students performing hip-thrusting moves on stage. The video clip, entitled Winnie the Pooh and the Bees, showed a group of teenage girls dancing in striped leotards, long socks and mini-skirts at the Orenburg dance school in southwest of the country. Condemned: Prosecutors said the women's 'erotic and sexual twerk dance' was disrespectful to those who fought in the Second World War . Increased sensitivity: The women's sentences come as Russia prepares to mark the 70th anniversary of the Second World War victory . A committee is currently investigating whether the hip-thrusting performance amounts to negligence or even 'debauched action' - punishable by a range of sanctions from community service to three years behind bars. In 2012, members of the Russian punk band Pussy Riot were jailed after performing a protest song in Moscow's main cathedral - also on charges of hooliganism. Nadezhda Tolokonnikova and Maria Alyokhina were not released until the end of 2013 after their act was seen as 'hooliganism motivated by religious hatred'. Historical site: The dancers performed at the Malaya Zemlya memorial, completed in 1982 to commemorate a battle to free Novorossiysk from German occupation in 1943 . Recent controversy: Just weeks ago, Russian officials closed down a dance school in Orenburg after students posted this twerking video to YouTube .
Northampton will await expert opinion before deciding when George North will next play after confirming the Wales wing will miss Saturday's European Champions Cup quarter-final at Clermont Auvergne after his latest head injury. North has been knocked unconscious three times in recent months, including in last Friday's 52-30 win over Wasps, and was on Wednesday being assessed by a neurologist. 'We won't play him at the weekend,' Saints director of rugby Jim Mallinder said. George North lies motionless on the Franklin's Gardens turf after being knocked out against Wasps . 'Clearly he had a nasty knock. He did get knocked unconscious for a very short period of time. Thankfully he was well looked after, he came round very quickly and has had no real bad adverse after-effects. But even so, we won't play him this weekend. 'He's making good progress. He's improving and down there at the moment going to see a neurologist and we'll wait to see what the experts say. 'We've got to make sure the medical experts are happy and satisfied that he is fit to return to play and as soon as they say he is, then we'll be happy to pick him again.' North left the field unconscious after scoring the second of two tries in Saints' win, with Wasps forward Nathan Hughes sent off for dangerous play as the Wales wing touched down. Hughes protested his innocence but on Tuesday was banned for three weeks. North also suffered blows to the head on Wales duty in the autumn and during the RBS 6 Nations when twice he had head knocks in the opener against England, controversially continuing before being stood down for the Scotland clash. Former World Rugby medical adviser Dr Barry O'Driscoll says North - the top try-scorer in the competition with seven this season - should not play again this term. Nathan Hughes arrives late as North touches down - moments later his leg connected with the wing's head . Mallinder is not unduly concerned but will await medical opinion. 'There's been lots of opinion over the last few days in particular,' Mallinder said. 'We've got to be careful that we don't blow anything out of proportion. 'It's a tough game. George has said that himself. People who play the game understand that there are inherent dangers, I suppose, of playing. 'We're always going to have incidents but player welfare will always come first. We will make sure we follow all protocols.' North might have been eligible for Saturday's match, had he passed the return to play concussion protocols. Mallinder added: 'If it was his first one (concussion) then we would be considering him, if he passed all the protocols that he had to and was available. 'Seeing as it's not his first then it's the sensible thing to take specialist opinion.' Mallinder was reluctant to comment on Hughes' three-week ban - a punishment which left his Wasps team-mate James Haskell to tweet 'astounded would be an understatement' - but insisted he did not want to see the incident repeated. The Welshman receives medical treatment on the pitch before being taken off on a stretcher . Mallinder said: 'I said at the time I think it was a red card offence. I still do. The disciplinary process has taken place and that's what he's got. 'You've got to be very, very careful. George North scored a try and therefore there wasn't much anybody could do about that. 'You've got to make as much effort as you can to get away from that incident. We don't want that happening again.' The English champions will, without North, bid to end Clermont's 22-game unbeaten run in European competition at Stade Marcel-Michelin. Two previous meetings have been won by the Frenchmen, who have never lost a home quarter-final in the competition. Mallinder said: 'It is going to be a massive challenge but we have had a few of these challenges over the years.

Americans who were on Mount Everest when it was hit by a deadly avalanche have described the moment the wall of snow and ice hit their camp and the carnage that surrounded them during the aftermath. At least 17 climbers, including three Americans, and many sherpas died as a result of the earthquake that has killed 2,500 people across the Himalayas. Some people managed to survive, but others are still trapped on the mountain waiting to be rescued. Scroll down for video . Jon Reiter, a contractor from Kenwood, California, was attempting his third ascent to the summit when the avalanche hit. He described how he tended for the injured even after doctors told him there is little chance they will survive . Scott Holder, a financial adviser from Santa Rosa, California, and Jon Reiter, a contractor from nearby Kenwood in Sonoma County, were caught up in the deadly avalanche. Reiter, who was making his third attempt at the summit, called is wife Susan by satellite phone, The Press Democrat reported. He described how he was given medicine to give to the injured, but one doctor told him: 'Don’t worry, you are just comforting these people. Most of them are not going to survive.' Saying he had a 'pretty rough day' Saturday, he added during an interview with CNN that he was forced to zip a dead body into a sleeping bag. She then posted on his blog about what had happened. 'He said that the ground shook for a very long time and that avalanches were happening one right after another on the mountain, ' she wrote. 'We just talked for a minute and he got off the phone because he and his climbing partner Moises are helping with the rescue effort. Jon and Moises don't have medical training but they are acting as medics because so many people are injured. 'He said that most of base camp was damaged. All the IMG (International Mountain Guides) group tents are being used as temporary medical facilities for the injured. ' Jon also spoke to CNN on Sunday, saying: 'We're feeling pretty lucky today.' Holder managed to escape the carnage - having to leave the mountain with a severe head cold one day before the earthquake hit. He said: 'God definitely had his hand in my survival. My cold took me out of the danger zone. I guess you could say God gave me a cold.' Ashleigh Stumler from Charlotte, North Carolina, thought she was getting dizzy as she hiked on Mount Everest, but a guide soon informed her it was an earthquake. She told WSOC that she was forced to hang onto a tree as the earth shook. Ashleigh Stumler from Charlotte, North Carolina, thought she was getting dizzy as she hiked on Mount Everest, but a guide soon informed her it was an earthquake . As she makes her way down from the mountain, she is hoping to help survivors and is gathering contacts in the United States in a bid to raise funds. 'These have been some of the most incredible, strong people I've ever met in my entire life. Just good people and they are in dire need of help.' Melissa Arnot, who was set to be only the second woman to climb Everest without oxygen checked in via sattellite phone to say her team was safe on Saturday. Among mountaineers thought to have died in the disaster is 33-year-old Google executive and a former medical student doctor offering care at the site while a filmmaker recording a documentary at the base camp was also killed. American Google executive Dan Fredinburg was the first confirmed fatality on the mountain yesterday. Dr Marisa Eve Girawong, 29, was also killed when ice and rock crushed the 18,000-foot-altitude base camp where she worked as a medic for Madison Mountaineering. A third American, Tom Taplin, 61, who owned TET Films & Photography, was making a documentary when the earthquake hit, NBC News reported. His wife Corey Fryer told the station he died 'doing what he loved'. It is the worst natural disaster Nepal has seen in 81 years, and the highest death toll ever recorded on Everest. Before now, the mountain's deadliest year was 2014, when 16 people died in one day. Rescuers help a porter onto a makeshift stretcher after he was injured when the wall of ice and snow hit .
An Oregon couple announced they are expecting a child in a rap video they made set to the theme  from '90s television sitcom 'The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.' The clip, which features Jesse and Melissa Meek rapping as they drive in a car, has been viewed over 1.7 million times on YouTube.

In the Meeks' parody video, Melissa raps, 'When our family and friends, who were up to no good, started asking questions about parenthood. 'We told one little lie, said "It's not time yet." Parents said "We're ready for grandkids, get a move on it!"' Jesse raps that the couple thought it would take longer than the two months the pair spent trying to conceive. Melissa says in the video 'I woke up in the morning about 7 or 8 and I thought to myself, "Oh man, I'm late!" Looked at the test and it was finally there. The little plus sign. We're now three. Not a pair.' At the end of the video, the Meeks smile and share a sonogram of their unborn child. It took five takes to film the clip, the couple told KPTV.

Arsenal duo Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Kieran Gibbs appear to have convinced American rapper Tyga to nail his colours to the red half of north London. Oxlade-Chamberlain and Gibbs posed for a picture with Tyga while taking the Rack City artist for a tour of the Emirates Stadium. Tyga, who has been making headlines during the last few months for dating the youngest Kardashian sister - 17-year-old Kylie Jenner, appeared to dye his hair red to show his support to Arsenal.

A Hillary Clinton campaign official explained on Monday why her presidential advisers have brought pre-screened partisans to some events promoted as an opportunity for the former secretary of state to meet with 'everyday Americans.' Just steps away in a Keene, New Hampshire bakery, a few run-of-the-mill people decided they didn't want to be seen with her. 'There was a bit of a thing back here when she came in,' explained Marcia DuBois, a cashier at Kristin's Bistro & Bakery on Washington Street, where Clinton spent a half-hour talking with customers and shaking hands. 'A few of the staff didn't want to come out to meet Hillary,' DuBois said. 'They just don't like her.' 'Which is too bad,' a co-worker offered while looking furtively to see who was listening. 'You may not agree with her. Okay. But you should respect the office she's shooting for.' Scroll down for videos . Hillary Clinton met a few employees at Kristin's Bakery in Keene, New Hampshire on Monday as her presidential campaign in the Granite State got underway, but some in the kitchen refused to be seen with her . The former first lady, senator and secretary of state posed with locals before a small-business roundtable event, but her communications director wouldn't rule out the possibility that some of them were brought in for the occasion . CHAT:  On her way to a discussion at a local company Hillary Clinton stopped at Kristin's bakery and met some customers. MEETING: Hillary was welcomed by people in the coffee shop - although not universally . The dissenting kitchen staffers declined to be identified or speak on the record. Others at Kristin's were more congenial, including an infant girl named Molly who cooed while Clinton held her. 'I'm going to take her home,' the Democratic White House hopeful joked. While Clinton held court with three Granite Staters and their pastries, her communications director Jennifer Palmieri explained the unfolding scene. Asked whether the campaign had brought any of the customers with them, Palmieri said, 'I think maybe some of them, but I don't know.' New Hampshire's WMUR-TV later reported that two of the people Clinton spoke with had been asked to come. Clinton's team took flak last week in Iowa after a Democratic Party operative conceded that Clinton's state political director Troy Price pre-vetted and drove a trio of activists to a coffee shop, where they played the part of everyday Americans while shutters snapped. The man, Austin Bird, had been an Obama intern in 2012 and was Vice President Joe Biden's chauffeur when he came to Davenport Iowa last year. As senior campaign aide Huma Abedin made tea, Palmieri defended the practice of recruiting participants to attend those small meetings. It's a necessary evil in early primary and caucus states, Palmieri said, and part of recruiting future Clinton evangelists from among the Democratic base. 'We have to go after Democrats before we do anything else,' she insisted. 'And in Iowa? Especially in Iowa, and New Hampshire.' 'But sure. People are asked –' MEET MOLLY: Clinton enjoyed the oldest campaign tactic in the book – posing with a baby – on Monday, and gushing that she wanted to bring the infant home with her . SIT-DOWN: Hillary Clinton at the campaign stop at Kirsten's bakery and coffee shop in Keene, New Hampshire . AIDE: Huma Abedin, Hillary's right-hand woman was present for the stop today. She was by her side as they stopped in Chipotle in Ohio, where they left without leaving a tip . In LeClaire, Iowa six days ago, Clinton's campaign took flack for bringing three Iowa Democratic partisans to a cafe where they appeared to be 'everyday Americans' meeting over coffee . Jennifer Palmieri (file photo) Palmieri thought briefly and reframed her comments in the past tense. 'People were asked to come to a meeting at a coffee house,'  she said, referring to a stop in in LeClaire, Iowa. Price, the Iowa political strategist, brought Bird to the Iowa coffee house along with two young women – one a Planned Parenthood employee, the other a College Democrats chapter head. 'If someone like that loves her, then they'll talk to other people, and so on, and that's going to help,' Palmieri said. 'We wanted to go after those specific people. I mean, they could go for O'Malley. They could do a lot of things.' Former Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley has been sending signals that he's ready to mount a challenge to Clinton. Clinton was in Keene on Monday for a roundtable discussion with small business employees. She will lead a similarly intimate event on Tuesday in Concord.

TUNE-UP: One of the Scooby vans gets a tune-up before beginning the new road trip from Chappaqua to New Hampshire this weekend . As the Democratic front-runner made her way to the back to shake hands with some of the bakery employees, she ignored questions and kept her comments superficial. One man addressed her as 'Secretary Clinton,' while a woman settled on 'Mrs. Clinton.' Palmieri said her boss has become accustomed to answering to a variety of titles and honorifics. 'Secretary Clinton, Senator Clinton, Mrs. Clinton – she doesn't care,' she said.
David Moyes has revealed that Chelsea were close to signing Wayne Rooney during his ill-fated tenure as Manchester United manager. Moyes, who gave Rooney his professional debut as a 16-year-old at Everton, succeeded Sir Alex Ferguson in the summer of 2013 - with the England striker being heavily linked with a move to Stamford Bridge at the same time. The pair had a well-publicised falling out following Rooney's departure from Goodison Park in 2004, but Moyes fought hard to retain the United forward's services at Old Trafford. Wayne Rooney (left) tracks Eden Hazard during Manchester United's clash with Chelsea on Saturday . Rooney gets a shot away despite the attention of Kurt Zouma during his side's 1-0 loss at Stamford Bridge . 'I look at Wayne Rooney. I gave him his professional debut aged 16 and he's now on the verge of breaking all Manchester United's scoring records,' Moyes told the Sunday Times. 'It was only a short time ago that Wayne could have easily left United. But I always felt he was as good as any British player out there; wherever he plays, he's a great footballer and, most importantly, he'll always score goals. 'Now, I'm delighted for Wayne, because Chelsea were close to taking him. Jose (Mourinho) was interested but we wouldn't do any business. David Moyes succeed Sir Alex Ferguson as United manager during the summer of 2013 . 'I had to fight to make sure he stayed - and was at the heart again, of what Manchester United were going to be moving forward.' Rooney has been a vital cog in Louis van Gaal's new-look United outfit this season with his side on course on for a Champions League place next year despite their 1-0 loss to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Saturday. Moyes gave a 16-year-old Rooney his professional debut at Everton back in 2002 .
Sweden’s passport has been named the most powerful in the world, but it turns out it’s also one of the most highly sought-after travel documents on the black market. The latest research suggests Swedish passports are among the most frequently sold in underground trading, as there is no upper limit on the number of replacements available to the rightful holder. They can sell for as much as £6,000 each – far more than the £28 fee that Sweden’s government charges for new or renewed travel documents. Sweden's passport was among the most frequently sold travel documents on the black market . The findings are contained in a new GoEuro infographic which ranks the world’s most powerful passports and takes a look at quirky facts . When placed under an ultraviolet light a Canadian passport displays colourful images on its pages, including the Parliament building in Ottawa. The Finnish passport displays a walking moose when the pages are flipped, while the cover of Belgium’s passports offer three different sequences of languages, starting with Dutch, French or German. Meanwhile, the British passport is also one of the most powerful travel documents on the planet, but it doesn't come cheap. Britons have one of the most powerful passports in the world, allowing visa-free access to 174 countries . The study suggests that UK travellers are paying some of the highest passport costs in the world, with fees being far less in places such as Afghanistan, the United Arab Emirates, Czech Republic, China and Russia. Research by travel website GoEuro found that the British passport is the 11th most expensive of 51 countries included in the study, and it takes a worker earning minimum wage 11 hours to pay it off. The UAE has the most affordable passport at just £9, while Turkey has the most expensive at £166, said Berlin-based GoEuro. Based on its research the travel website named Sweden's passport the most powerful in the world. It allows visa-free entry into 174 countries – the same as Finland, Germany, the UK and the US – but was ranked No 1 by the website due to its cost. Swedes pay just £28 for a passport, with GoEuro claiming that it takes only one hour for the average worker to pay it off. Sweden doesn’t have a legal minimum wage, and salaries are determined through collective bargaining. When cost is used as the deciding factor, the UK passport is the fourth most powerful in the world – behind Sweden, Finland and Germany – with a fee of £73. In Liberia, it would take a worker earning minimum wage 278 hours to pay off the country's £33 passport. And it appears travellers around the world would love to get their hands on a UK passport. In a recent poll 20 per cent of those surveyed said they would choose a UK passport if they could get an extra nationality in addition to their own, even though it is one of the most expensive in the world. It was followed by passports for the US (18 per cent), Switzerland (17 per cent), Germany (10 per cent) and Canada and Australia with nine per cent each.
Turkey has blocked access to Twitter and YouTube after they refused a request to remove pictures of a prosecutor held during an armed siege last week. A Turkish court imposed the blocks because images of the deadly siege were being shared on social media and 'deeply upset' the wife and children of Mehmet Selim Kiraz, the hostage who was killed. The 46-year-old Turkish prosecutor died in hospital when members of the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front (DHKP-C) stormed a courthouse and took him hostage. The DHKP-C is considered a terrorist group by Turkey, the European Union and US. Scroll down for video . A Turkish court has blocked access to Twitter and YouTube after they refused a request to remove pictures of prosecutor Mehmet Selim Kiraz held during an armed siege last week . Grief: The family of Mehmet Selim Kiraz grieve over his coffin during his funeral at Eyup Sultan Mosque in Istanbul, Turkey. He died in hospital after he was taken hostage by the far-left organisation . Two of his captors were killed when security forces took back the building where the far-left group was holding him. Gunshots were heard and smoke could be seen rising from the scene at the end of the six-hour stand-off. Mr Kiraz, a father-of-two married to a judge who also worked at the courthouse, was targeted for his part in an investigation into the death of Berkin Elvan. The 15-year-old was severely wounded after being hit on the head by a tear-gas canister fired by a police officer during anti-government protests in Istanbul in June 2013. After spending 269 days in a coma, Elvan eventually died on March 11 last year. His death, and the subsequent investigation, have since become a rallying point for the country's far-left. Gathering: Prosecutors, lawyers and judges stand near a statue of Lady Justice during the funeral ceremony . A British national, of Polish origin but who has not been named, was arrested on Saturday as part of an operation against the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front, according to reports. A Foreign Office spokeswoman said this morning: 'I can confirm that a British national has been arrested in Turkey and that we are offering consular assistance.' Before imposing the blocks on the websites, Turkish authorities had tried to prevent newspapers printing images taken during the siege last week. The newspapers were accused by the government of 'spreading terrorist propaganda' in sharing the images of the hostage-taking. Presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said: 'This has to do with the publishing of the prosecutor's . picture. What happened in the aftermath (of the prosecutor's . killing) is as grim as the incident itself. 'The demand from the prosecutor's office is that this image . not be used anywhere in electronic platforms. 'The wife and children of prosecutor Kiraz have been deeply . upset. The images are everywhere.' He added: 'A request has been made to both Twitter and YouTube for the . removal of the images and posts but they have not accepted it . and no response has been given. 'That's why . this decision has been taken through a court in Istanbul.' Critical: Prosecutor Mehmet Selim Kiraz was taken to hospital with gunshot wounds but died of his injuries . Strength of feeling: Elvan has since become an icon for the Turkish far-left and his supporters accuse the authorities of covering up the circumstances and perpetrators of his death . Google said it was working to restore service to the YouTube . video-sharing site, which it owns. Twitter also said it was . working to restore access for its users. Facebook said it had complied with a Turkish court order requiring it to restrict access to some content or face a block on its service. A company spokesman said it would appeal the order. Turkey's telecoms regulator could not immediately be reached . and there was no statement on its website. This is not the first time that Turkish authorities have imposed blocks on social media sites and networks. In the run-up to local elections in March 2014 blocks were imposed after recordings circulated allegedly revealing corruption among senior officials. Figures provided by Twitter revealed that Turkey filed more requests to remove content from the social network than any other nation between July and December 2014.
Stuart McCall revealed captain Lee McCulloch apologised to him and the Rangers players after being sent off in the 2-1 win over runaway Scottish Championship winners Hearts at Ibrox. Goals from striker Kenny Miller and the returning midfielder Haris Vuckic had the home side two ahead and cruising before McCulloch was shown a straight red card by referee Bobby Madden for fouling striker Osman Sow. It left the 10-man Govan side to fight a rearguard battle in the second half and, although Jambos striker Genero Zeefuik reduced the deficit in the 83rd minute, Rangers held on to move into second place in the league, three points ahead of Hibernian with a game in hand over the Leith club. Lee McCulloch was sent off during Rangers' crucial 2-1 victory against Hearts in the Scottish Championship . Staurt McCall says the Gers captain apologised to him as well as the players after the incident . The Gers boss said: 'Believe it or not I haven't seen it again and I didn't see it live - all I was interested in was Zeefuik going through the middle - but I spoke to Bobby coming off and he said he caught him with his elbow. 'Jig (McCulloch) came in after the game and apologised to me and the team so obviously it must have merited a red card.' The former Rangers midfielder paid tribute to Gers supporters in the crowd of 40,521 who willed their team on to a third successive win when they were down to 10 men. He said: 'In the second half, that was the first time for a long, long time, since I was playing, that I got goosebumps out there. McCulloch walks off the pitch after he was shown the red card on Easter Sunday . 'The fans deserved that (win) but I thought the players deserved their applause coming off the park because you need both together to be a success. 'It was pleasing in a lot of ways. We set out with a game plan to stop Hearts playing because they are a good side, no doubt about that. 'Obviously it was two terrific goals, but I thought the tempo and passing in the first half was outstanding. 'I thought the second half was just about guts, desire, being a good team-mate, so it was a hard shift but a nervy finish.' Man of the match Nicky Law also noted the improving relationship between players and supporters. The Rangers midfielder said: 'The crowd just lifted everyone and the atmosphere was as good as it has been since I signed at the club and Hearts fans played their part in that as well. 'Probably for the first time the fans have been right behind us and united as one, which it hasn't been for a while and that was great to see. 'We know that has been down to ourselves in large parts because it hasn't been good enough. 'But we hope that they see the effort we are putting in and hopefully we can achieve the aim that we started the season with and repay the fans. 'It was a huge win for us. Three wins on the spin now and the boys are buzzing.' McCall has paid tribute to the 40,521 Rangers fans who made it to Ibrox for the game . It was Hearts' first away defeat in the league all season and head coach Robbie Neilson refused to be too downbeat. He said: 'I thought we dominated in the second half without creating a lot of chances. I don't think we did enough to win. 'But the pleasing think is I am sitting here at Ibrox, having lost 2-1 and everyone is devastated. 'We have to take a step back and look at the big picture. 'We are 23 points clear at the top of the Championship and we are guaranteed top level football next year. 'So I don't want to be too down. I spoke to the players after the game and told them to put it into perspective. 'When they walk out of Ibrox they should have their heads held high because they are champions and it doesn't matter what happens in one game, it is a 36-game league and they have been the best team.'

The man who was sat in the car with Walter Scott moments before his fatal shooting has broken his silence. Pierre Fulton was in the passenger seat when Officer Michael Slager pulled them over for a broken tail light. When Scott fled, Fulton and another officer stood by the Mercedes watching in shock as Slager chased him into a park and shot him dead. Now, as Slager faces murder charges and national scrutiny, Fulton's attorney has released a statement. Warning: Graphic Content Below . Scroll down for audio and video . 'He didn't deserve to die': Pierre Fulton, who was in the car with Walter Scott when Officer Michael Slager pulled them over for a broken tail light, has broken his silence. He said he does not know why Scott ran . 'Walter was a dear friend and I miss him every day. 'Over the past five years he helped me to become a better man and showed me the value of hard work. 'I'll never know why he ran, but I know he didn't deserve to die. Please keep Walter and his family in your prayers and respect my privacy moving forward.' His words on Monday night came as audio surfaced of Officer Slager laughing and admitting to experiencing a rush of adrenaline in the minutes following the deadly shooting in South Carolina on April 5. Slager, 33, can be heard chuckling nervously while talking with a senior officer. The conversation was picked up by the dashcam in the officer's patrol car following the incident in North Charleston on April 5. The dashcam footage showing Scott, 50, a Coast Guard veteran, being pulled over for a broken tail light just minutes before Slager shot him, was released to the media on Thursday. The camera continued to record for another hour and a recording of the audio feed, including the conversation between Slager and a senior officer, was obtained by The Guardian. 'By the time you get home, it would probably be a good idea to kind of jot down your thoughts on what happened,' the senior officer said. 'You know, once the adrenaline quits pumping.' 'It's pumping,' Slager said, laughing. The senior officer replied: 'Oh yeah. Oh yeah.' The senior officer told Slager during the conversation to go home and relax, assuring him that he would not have to answer questions about the shooting for days. Scott was shot five times in the back as he ran away from the traffic stop. The father of four's death has sparked a nationwide debate about police brutality and bias against black people after a witness published video contradicting the police account of the event. Slager can be heard laughing nervously while talking with a senior officer. The conversation was picked up by the dashcam in the officer's patrol car following the incident in North Charleston on April 5 . Slager, 33, who is white, said that he felt 'threatened' by Scott, who is black, during a confrontation over his Taser, but video shows the civilian running away before being shot. The dashcam also recorded a cellphone call that Slager received about five minutes before his conversation with the senior officer. 'Hey. Hey, everything's OK, OK?' Slager said, after an iPhone ringtone was heard. Slager then appears to say: 'He grabbed my taser, yeah. Yeah, he was running from me.' His wife, Jamie, is eight months pregnant with their first child. Slager was fired from the North Charleston police and charged with murder on Tuesday. A group of black attorneys have called for the second officer connected to the fatal shooting to be arrested. National Bar Association officials said that Officer Clarence Habersham, 37, who was the second policeman to arrive at the dead man's body after Slager, should be fired and prosecuted for filing a false report. The National Bar Association is calling for North Chareston officer Clarence Habersham, 37 (right) to be arrested for falsifying a report about the actions of  Michael Slager, 33 (left), during the death of Walter Scott . Habersham (right) was the second office to arrive at the body of Scott, 50, and did not report Slager's actions leading up to the shooting . Habersham, who approached the body after Slager went to go grab the Taser that fell, can be seen examining Scott. Slager then drops the Taser next to the dead body in the presence of Habersham. Habersham then used his radio to report that Scott had gunshot wounds to his chest, right side, and backside. However, the black officer gave a two-sentence supplemental report and said that he tried to render aid to the body, which no one in the video does. Officers in the video are seen walking around and checking the pulse of the body. Sergeant James Gann wrote in his report that he helped Habersham administer first aid and CPR. On April 4, 2015 I Officer Habersham responded to the empty Lot behind Mega Pawn in reference to the above incident. I (Habersham) attempted to render aid to the victim by applying pressure to the gunshot wounds and directing the best route for EMS and fire to take to get to the victim faster. Video released after Slager's account into the death shows Scott (left) running away from the traffic stop when he is shot. Mourners have placed flowers at a memorial to the veteran (right) over the past week . Slager said after the incident that he 'felt threatened' by Scott, though video shot by Feidin Santana contradicts his report . Feidin Santana, who filmed a widely circulated video of the incident, said he did not any officers giving Scott CPR. The National Bar Association, the country's oldest group of black lawyers, said that Habersham 'deliberately left material facts out of his report' and left it 'incomplete'. The group said it was 'outraged' by the incident and that any other officer of the seven that quickly arrived on the scene should be indicted if they filed a false report. Police are interviewing all officers involved, a police source told CBS News. Chief Eddie Driggers said that he would not comment because the investigation is ongoing. Habersham was accused of excessive force by another black South Carolina resident, Sheldon Williams, 47. POLICE VERSION . Police officer Michael Slager said in a statement earlier this week that his encounter with Walter Scott began at around 9.30am on Saturday. He said he pulled Scott's Mercedes over as a routine traffic stop for a broken brake light. He said Scott then ran away into a vacant grassy lot where, at some point during the chase, the victim confronts Slager. The officer then tried to use his Taser to subdue Scott, but claims the suspect grabbed the stun gun during the struggle, according to the statement. According to police reports, Slager fired the stun gun, but it did not stop Scott. At that point, the officer fired at Scott several times because he 'felt threatened,' Slager's statement said. He added that his actions were in line with procedure. Police then said Slager reported on his radio moments after the struggle: 'Shots fired and the subject is down. He took my Taser.' His department said the officers then performed CPR and delivered first aid to the victim. WHAT THE VIDEO SHOWS . Slager's account has been called into question after the video appears to show him shooting Scott in the back. The footage begins in the vacant lot apparently moments after Slager fires his Taser. Wires which administer the electrical current appear to be extending from Scott's body. As Scott turns to run, Slager draws his pistol and, only when he is 15 to 20 feet away, starts to fire the first of the eight shots at his back. The video shows Slager handcuffing Scott's lifeless body. Footage then appears to show Slager jogging back to the point where the Taser fell to the ground, bringing it over to Scott's body around 30 feet away and dropping it next to him. It is only after two-and-a-half minutes that Slager is seen placing his hand on Scott's neck in an apparent attempt to check his pulse. A black colleague then arrives and puts on blue medical gloves before handling the body, but is not seen performing first aid. They are joined by a third officer, who also does not appear to tend to the victim. Relatives of Scott say their goodbyes to him on Saturday at a funeral that was was so widely attended that hundreds were left outside .

Scott was laid to rest on Saturday, his casket draped in an American flag and accompanied by his distraught mother. So many people came to the service that hundreds were left waiting outside. US senator Tim Scott (R-SC), Congressman Jim Clyburn (D-SC), state senator Marlon Kimpson, Charleston County Sheriff Al Cannon, and Elder James Johnson of the National Action Network all attended.

The service was also attended by a number of the state's politcians . Scott, who was remembered as a beloved father, had his coffin draped in an American flag during Saturday's funeral ceremony .
The Tories today launched an extraordinary attack on Ed Miliband, claiming that after stabbing his brother in the back he now wants to do the same to Britain. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon claimed the Labour leader was willing to trade away Britain's nuclear deterrent in order to secure power in a backroom deal with the Scottish Nationalists. Mr Miliband said the Conservative campaign had 'descended into the gutter' and claimed David Cameron 'should be ashamed'. Deeply personal: Defence Secretary Michael Fallon  claimed Ed Miliband is 'so desperate' for power he is willing to weaken UK defences to win support from SNP . He confirmed that a Conservative government would go ahead with four new Trident nuclear missile submarines to replace the existing fleet, at a cost of £100billion. Labour rushed to say it was also backing four submarines, despite Ed Balls last month saying he was examining the idea of cutting it to three. Doubt has been cast on Labour's commitment to the deterrent because Mr Miliband could be forced to rely on the SNP support to form a government. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon has made clear that scrapping the Trident missile system, which is based in Scotland, would be a red line for her propping up a Labour government in Westminster. Mr Fallon launched a highly personal attack on Mr Miliband, saying it was an issue of trust and leadership. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'We need to be absolutely clear when we come to this decision in the next parliament. 'We saw in that leadership election just what he would do to get into power. We saw what he did to his own brother. We need to know what he would do. 'We can't be sure what kind of backstairs deal he is likely to do with the SNP ... that is the uncertainty. We have seen what he is prepared to do to get into power.' In a speech today, he said: 'Ed Miliband stabbed his own brother in the back to become Labour leader. Now he is willing to stab the United Kingdom in the back to become prime minister.' Mr Fallon will insist the Tories would 'never' do a deal on the future of Trident in another coalition – and that a man prepared to stab his brother in the back to win the Labour leadership cannot be trusted not to risk the nation's security. 'Nicola Sturgeon could not be clearer. She has told Ed Miliband that scrapping Trident – our country's vital nuclear deterrent – is a red line she will not cross,' the Defence Secretary will say. 'If he wants the keys to No 10, he must abandon any plans to renew our current Vanguard ballistic missile submarines. 'The SNP's childlike world view would sacrifice the long-term security of the UK. The nuclear deterrent protects all of Britain, and the SNP represents a separatist threat that would dangerously weaken our collective defence. Britain doesn't pay ransoms and the Conservatives would never bow to demands from Scottish separatists. Vow: The attack comes as the Tories pledge to build a £100billion fleet of four new Trident submarines . Mr Miliband brushed off the criticism, insisting he had 'got use to' Conservative attacks. Speaking at an event in London, the Labour leader added: 'The Conservative Party can throw what they like at me, they can make all the personal attacks on me that they want to, but I've got use to it. 'And you know what? I'm resilient. And I'm resilient for one reason alone - because I'm fighting for the British people in this campaign. 'I'm fighting for the kind of country the British people want.' Mr Miliband said that over the first two weeks of the Conservative campaign, it was clear 'they have nothing positive to say about the country'. The Labour leader said: 'I think David Cameron should be ashamed. He's got nothing positive to say about the future of the country, he's got no forward vision for the country. And he sends out his minions, like Michael Fallon, to engage in desperate smears. 'I think decent Conservatives right across our country, decent Conservative MPs, decent Conservative party members, decent people right across Britain, will say `Come on, we're better than this kind of politics'. There is mounting Labour panic at polls suggesting the rampant SNP is on course for a landslide north of the border. Such a political earthquake would be likely to leave the SNP holding the balance of power at Westminster and determining who is in government for the first time in the 300-year history of the Union. Shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander told the same programme that the Labour Party had made it 'crystal clear' it supports the renewal of Trident. He said: 'This is desperate stuff from a rattled campaign that spent yesterday defending tax avoidance and is now descending into politics of the gutter. 'This is not up for negotiation with the SNP or with any other party. I don't know how I can say it plainer than that. 'We are absolutely committed to a continuous at-sea deterrent. The Tories are like a wounded, cornered animal at the moment.' SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon has made clear that scrapping the Trident missile system, which is based in Scotland, would be a red line for her propping up a Labour government in Westminster . Diane Abbott, who used Twitter to question the £100billion cost of the weapons system . Labour leader Ed Miliband faces a challenge from dozens of Labour candidates calling for Trident to be scrapped. Among them is Diane Abbott, who used Twitter to question the £100billion cost of the weapons system. 'How exactly does submarine system designed for Cold War era combat new threats from international terrorism?' she asked. 'Renewing Trident could cost £100 billion. Would pay for: 150,000 new nurses; 1.5 million affordable homes; 2 million jobs & much more.' Labour CND lists 52 candidates standing for election on May 7 calling for Trident to be scrapped. They call for 'a Labour Government that delivers on disarmament of the UK's nuclear weapons, as we are bound to under the Non-Proliferation Treaty'. Both Labour and the SNP have ruled out a formal coalition, but left the door open to a looser deal that would see Mr Miliband in power even if he wins fewer seats than the Tories. Earlier this year, Mr Miliband suggested he might back a cheaper Trident replacement than the current plan, estimated at £100billion for four submarines at about £5billion each, and annual running costs of £3billion over the subs' lifetime of about 30 years. Today's Tory pledge puts Labour in a difficult position, since ruling out any compromise on Trident would infuriate the SNP and many voters in Scotland, where support for the system's renewal is lower than in the rest of the UK. Mr Fallon will add today: 'It is a sign of his weakness he has failed to rule out a deal. Voters can only conclude he would be prepared to trade Britain's security just to get his hands on the keys to Downing Street. 'The future of our country's security will be on the ballot paper too. There will be a clear choice between a Conservative government that will put our national security first. Or Ed Miliband, a man so desperate for power he is ready to barter away our nuclear deterrent in a backroom deal with the SNP.' Liberal Democrat defence spokesman Sir Nick Harvey said he did not see any need for Trident to be patrolling the seas 24/7 while the UK has 'no known nuclear adversary'. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the nuclear deterrent was 'worth retaining', but said two submarines would provide a 'perfectly meaningful deterrent', although not on a 'continuous basis'. Retaining three submarines would enable the UK to have a 'continuous at-sea deterrence', he added. Natalie Bennett, leader of the Green Party, said: 'This latest round of Tory speculation doesn't conceal the fact that the Labour Party is committed to renewing our multibillion pound nuclear weapons system. 'The truth is that the Labour leadership has made it clear that they will prioritise spending £100billion on a cold war relic - rather than investing in the schools and hospitals that this country so desperately needs. 'Only one party is standing up to Trident across the UK. Green MPs will put pressure on the Government to ensure that a proper debate is had over Trident.'
It seems that scoring stunning volleys in Tyne-Wear derbies is not the limit of Sunderland striker Jermain Defoe's limits as he shows off his impressive keepy up skills with a tennis ball. Fresh from his heroics on Sunday when he struck a brilliant volley to earn his side victory against Newcastle at the Stadium of Light, Defoe was the first player to take part in Sunderland's keepy up challenge. The former Tottenham forward set an impressive score of 76 for his team-mates to beat before taking the second part of the challenge - keepy ups with a Creme Egg. Tyne-Wear derby hero Jermain Defoe takes on the Sunderland keepy up challenge . The former Tottenham and West Ham striker is the first Sunderland player to take the challenge . Defoe eventually sets an impressive score of 76 for his team-mates to attempt to beat . Defoe was unable to replicate the high score achieved with the tennis ball but managed to post a respectable-looking nine with the Easter treat. Defoe was overcome with emotion in the wake of his brilliant blast, and admits the joy it brought to a sold-out Stadium of Light was too much to take in. 'I have said many times that I missed the Premier League and it's because of games like this,' he said. 'Games like this are why I came back. Being at a club like this, they just love football. I was told before that if I come here and work hard and score goals, they won't ask for anything more. Sunderland striker Jermain Defoe celebrates after scoring a stunning volley against Newcastle . Defoe's superb first-half strike was enough to secure a 1-0 win for Sunderland in the Tyne-Wear derby . Newcastle goalkeeper Tim Krul was completely helpless as Defoe's shot found its way into the top corner . 'And I just love scoring goals, the fans deserved it. It's been really difficult for them in the last few weeks but they always turn out. 'It was the whole occasion really that got to me. It was great to be the person that made so many people happy. I was just thinking, "Why me?". 'As the whistle went for half-time and as I was walking down the tunnel I thought, "I'm crying and I'm on the telly", but I didn't care. For the fans and everyone it was just a special day.' The 32-year-old not only wrote his name into Sunderland folklore with his derby winner at the weekend but boosted Dick Advocaat's side survival hopes. The North East club moved three points clear of the relegation zone with seven games to play as the Dutch manager earned his first win since taking charge.
After years of hoping he would rip opposition defences to shreds, Pep Guardiola has admitted he has to start trying to work out a way to stop Lionel Messi. On the prospect of facing the greatest player in Barcelona's history, Guardiola – the greatest coach the club has had – said: 'We will have to see what we can do in each of the two games and we will try to create the best defensive system possible to stop Messi. 'They are a wonderful team but so are we,' said the Bayern Munich boss. Pep Guardiola will be reintroduced to Barcelona in the Champions League semi-finals . The Bayern Munich coach must think of a way to stop the superb Lionel Messi next month . Guardiola goes back to Barcelona with the team now coached by Luis Enrique playing their best football since he left the club in 2012. 'It will be a very special game for me,' he said after the teams were drawn to face each other. 'It will also be special for Thiago [Alcantara] and for the rest of the coaching staff. I lived my whole life in Barcelona, it' s my home.' Guardiola nurtured Messi into the best player in the world while manager at the Nou Camp . Guardiola showed how much the club still means to him when alongside his father he watched them beat Manchester City in the last 16, cheering them on from the stands of the Nou  Camp. He did little to hide his appreciation for Messi that night and admitted that the four-times Ballon d'Or winner could punish Bayern if they are as sloppy as they were in the first leg against Porto in the quarter-finals. They went down 3-1 before hammering the Portuguese outfit 6-1 in Bavaria. He said: 'If we make the same mistakes then the tie will be all over in Barcelona.'

The Boy Scouts' New York chapter said Thursday that it has hired the nation's first openly gay Eagle Scout as a summer camp leader, which is in public contrast to the national scouting organization's ban on openly gay adult members. The Boy Scouts' Greater New York Councils said they hired Pascal Tessier, an 18-year-old Eagle Scout who has been a vocal advocate of opening the 105-year-old organization to gay scouts and leaders. Board member Richard G. Mason said the councils see Tessier as 'an exemplary candidate for employment as a camp leader.' Scroll down for video . Boy Scout Pascal Tessier, 18, center left, and his brother Lucien Tessier, 20, who had earned the rank of Eagle Scout, pose for a portrait with their parents, Oliver Tessier, left, and Tracie Felker, at their home. On Thursday the Boy Scouts New York chapter announced it hired Pascal Tessier as the nation's first openly gay Eagle Scout as a summer camp leader . 'We welcome him,' Mason said in a statement. The Boy Scouts of America didn't immediately respond to an inquiry about the hire. The national organization changed its policy in 2013 to allow openly gay kids as scouts, but not adults as leaders, after a bitter debate over its membership policy. The change took effect in January 2014. Advocates for letting gays participate in scouting hailed Tessier's hire. 'This is a watershed moment,' Zach Wahls, executive director of Scouts for Equality, said in a statement. 'We are proud to see such an important Boy Scout council standing up for the full inclusion of gay members.' When the national Boy Scouts began allowing gay boys as scouts, liberal Scout leaders and gay rights groups celebrated the shift but called for allowing gay adults to participate, too. Conservatives involved with the Scouts, including some churches that sponsor troops, decried letting any gays — including kids — participate, and some threatened to defect if the ban were lifted. The Boy Scouts of America has said it doesn't "proactively inquire" about members' sexual orientation — in effect, a form of 'don't ask, don't tell.' Tessier's hiring is in contrast to the national scouting organizationís ban on openly gay adult members . But it has expelled adults who were open about it, including a gay troop leader in Seattle who was removed last year after he disclosed his orientation during a TV interview. Regardless, some local Boy Scout councils have let it be known they are open to gay employees, but the New York councils' move presents an unusually acute departure from the national policy. The 103-year-old New York group says it has never denied membership to a youth or adult based on sexual orientation, and it didn't want its policy to be affected by the national group's stance. The New York councils serve over 46,000 scouts. Tessier achieved scouting's highest rank last year after being one of the most prominent openly gay scouts speaking out to change the ban on gay participation. The Kensington, Maryland, teen said then he was relieved finally to have his Eagle badge approved by the Scouts' national headquarters in Irving, Texas. 'Even if I had been kicked out along the way, I wouldn't have changed anything,' he said. 'The whole experience was something worth having, not only for myself but also for all the other people involved — and for all the people it affects.'
A former Wisconsin sheriff's deputy with Lou Gehrig's disease has been found not legally responsible in the killing of his wife and sister-in-law. Forty-year-old Andrew Steele had pleaded not guilty by reason of mental disease to two counts of first-degree intentional homicide in the August 22 shooting deaths of his 39-year-old wife, Ashlee Steele, and her sister, 38-year-old Kacee Tollefsbol of Lake Elmo, Minnesota. Defense attorneys argued that the disease damaged Steele's brain, making him not criminally responsible for the deaths. Scroll down for video . Former Wisconsin sheriff's deputy Andrew Steele, pictured in court earlier this month, has been found not legally responsible in the killing of his wife and sister-in-law on Thursday . This undated photo provided by Rachelle Putnam shows Ashlee Steele, left, and her sister, Kacee Tollefsbol, both were found dead of gunshot wounds at Steele's home in Fitchburg, Wisconsin, last August . A jury deliberated for about 10 hours until all but two of the 12 agreed the verdict early on Thursday. During Steele’s trial earlier this month forensic psychiatrist Dr. Doug Tucker had testified that a rambling note Steele wrote about suicide and sexual relations with his wife and sister-in-law was delusional and showed Steele's brain was deteriorating because of ALS. Tucker said that was the reason Steele killed the two and that he was 'unable to conform his conduct to the law.' The defendant had claimed he blacked out during the killings. Steele had been diagnosed with the progressive neurodegenerative disease last June. Lou Gehrig's disease, also called amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, attacks motor neurons, cells that control muscles. Prosecutors believed Steele planned the killings. The State had asked all witnesses if Steele had memory issues before that day in August, and they all said no. Defense attorneys argued that Lou Gehrig's disease had damaged Steele's brain, making him not criminally responsible for the deaths . Family: The couple, pictured, had two children, and had been together for 26 years . In a mostly incoherent, stream-of-consciousness letter written by Steele the day before the murders, the former deputy claimed he had had a sexual relationship with his sister-in-law and enjoyed 'numerous threesomes' with Kacee and his wife, reported the station WIBA. The typo-riddled note also stated that when Kacee and Ashlee learned of his ALS diagnosis, they proposed a suicide pact. According to Steele, the women wanted to jump off a cruise ship together, poison themselves with carbon monoxide inside a car, or shoot themselves with his service weapon. 'See you all on the other side,' the note concluded. The missive was last edited on Steele’s phone just after 6am on August 22. About seven hours later, a mortally wounded Kacee Tollefsbol called 911 saying she and her sisters had been shot. Dr Tucker testified that there was no evidence to support Steele's claims that he had been in a three-way relationship with his wife and sister-in-law. Friends of Kacee Tollefsbol also said in court that her and Steele's relationship did not go beyond that of a brother and sister, reported Wisconsin State Journal. Tearful testimony: The slain sisters’ third sibling, Hailee Mesiterling, said from the stand that Andrew Steele was in love with his sister-in-law . However, the slain sisters’ surviving sibling, Hailee Mesiterling, said from the stand that Andrew Steele was in love with Tollefsbol and acted inappropriately towards her during a family vacation last summer. Steele’s defense attorney, Jessa Nicholson, had told the court that her client maintained that on the day of the killings he and Ashlee had sex involving bondage, and a zip tie accidentally fastened too tight around her neck, according to WKOW. Steele’s last memory from that day, according to his attorney, is of him trying to find a pair of scissors to cut the restraint around his wife’s neck. He then blacked out and awakened later in a hospital bed with a tube down his throat. Unable to speak, the 40-year-old wrote notes asking if he had been in a car accident and inquiring after his wife. ALS: Andrew Steele, pictured in court in 2014, penned a rambling note a day before the killing claiming that he had had threesomes with his wife and sister-in-law, and that the three of them had made a suicide pact . Andrew Steele is wheeled out of his home in a stretcher after allegedly murdering his wife and her sister on August 22 . If the jury had found him responsible for the double-homicide, Steel could have faced up to a life sentence without parole. Ashlee Steele, 39, was found shot in the head in the master bedroom and cops found Andrew Steele sitting in a laundry room with a pistol. The former deputy had started the dryer and vented it back into the room and he had set up a grill loaded with hot charcoal in the room in a possible suicide attempt by carbon monoxide. The killings came just days after the victims and the suspect's friends took part in the ALS ice bucket challenge, raising $23,000 towards the ailing deputy's medical expenses. In his letter, Steele lamented that collected funds were not enough to cover their family's expenses. Between the two of them, the slain sisters have left six children behind.

Court battle: Lord Janner's alleged victims could sue him for £2.5million after the CPS dropped a prosecution against him for the fourth time . Lord Janner's alleged victims could sue him for £2.5million after being denied justice for the fourth time in 25 years when the CPS refused to prosecute him. Police have identified 25 people who claim the Labour peer attacked them and each could claim for up to £100,000. One man, allegedly attacked by Janner when he was living in a  children's homes between 1981 and 1988, has already instructed lawyers to sue him and Leicestershire County Council for damages. His solicitor Peter Garsden, president of the Association of Child Abuse Lawyers, has said that after a string of bungled investigations suing 'may be the only way the alleged victims are going to get some sort of justice'. Several of those who claim to have been sexually abused say Janner got to them through paedophile Frank Beck, a manager of Leicester children's homes accused of abusing more than 200 boys. The CPS last week said the 'core allegation' was that Lord Janner befriended Beck to access children 'to allow him to perpetrate serious sexual offences' on them. Beck died in jail in 1994. Mr Garsden said: 'We are preparing a claim for this man against Lord Janner and Leicestershire County Council. 'The allegations involved the most extreme abuse. Our case is that Frank Beck was running the home where this man was introduced to Greville Janner. 'Perhaps this is the only way the alleged victims in this case are going to get some sort of justice.' A compensation scheme for Jimmy Savile's dozens of victims was agreed at the High Court last year where those abused were paid out of his £3.3million estate. Last seen: Channel 4 News filmed Lord Jenner outside his house in London on July 8 2014, when he was last seen in public . Test cases: Victims abused by Jimmy Savile and Liberal MP Cyril Smith also sued after they were denied justice . Liz Dux, whose law firm Slater & Gordon respresents 168 of Jimmy Savile's victims and 10 of former Liberal MP for Rochdale Cyril Smith, says that Janner's alleged victims could be handed £100,000 each. Campaigners, police chiefs and MPs have accused Alison Saunders, the director of the CPS (above), of ignoring the rights of victims . Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders, who made the decision not to prosecute Lord Janner, claimed £13,400 in expenses last year including almost £7,000 on business-class flights. Her most recently published expenses show she flew business class to Washington, Dubai and New York in the year that the CPS was forced to cut its budget by 27 per cent. Mrs Saunders, pictured, has been heavily criticised in recent weeks over corruption charges against journalists and deciding not to prosecute Lord Janner over alleged sex offences. The publicly funded trips included one to the Caribbean for an ‘official meeting’ last September which cost the taxpayer £3,105 for hotels and flights. A CPS spokesman said: ‘The DPP’s travel overseas helps the CPS to join forces with other countries so we can reduce serious crime both in the UK and around the world.’ The CPS said the DPP travels standard fares unless there is a long-haul trip and a requirement to work immediately at the other end. Mrs Saunders, who earns £200,000 a year, charged the taxpayer £102 for one taxi journey. The CPS said they have strict rules on when taxis should be used, including when heavy baggage has to be carried or when there are no other suitable methods of transportation. She said: 'If the victims of Lord Janner are successful, damages could be sizeable. 'Civil redress is the next logical step after the CPS decision.' Lord Janner's family has said he is 'entirely innocent of any wrongdoing' and 'is a man of great integrity'. A Leicestershire County Council spokesman said: 'We have been co-operating with the police on aspects of their investigation that relate to historic abuse involving the former county council children's homes in the 1970s and 1980s. 'Since then, the council has introduced a series of safeguards and procedures to minimise the chances of this kind of abuse from happening again. All relevant documents have been provided to the police. 'We have not been approached so far regarding compensation claims and so cannot comment further at this time.' The CPS ruled last Thursday that there was enough evidence to charge him with 22 sexual offences against children dating from 1969 to 1988. However, Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said he would not be prosecuted because his deteriorating dementia means there could be no criminal conviction. She spoke of her 'deep regret' as she announced that Lord Janner will not face trial and admitted he should have been charged three times before in 1991, 2002 and 2007 but was left off the hook. Last night it emerged that Lord Janner signed a letter saying he wanted to remain a peer just a week before he was ruled unfit to face child sex charges. Abuse campaigners last night angrily questioned why the suspected paedophile was able to remain in the House of Lords if he was too frail to be brought before court. Leicestershire Police, who disagree with the decision not to charge Janner having investigated him for the past two years, have admitted they may contact the House of Lords about the letter. MailOnline revealed yesterday that at least 19 men with dementia have been convicted of child sex offences since 2010, including ten in the past year. Signed: Dementia sufferer Lord Janner signed a letter on April 9, just a week after he was deemed unfit to stand trial. His signature has been redacted for privacy reasons .
Standing in a public shower cubicle with my screaming 15-month-old son, I was starting to wonder whether I truly was a Keycamp type of person. My hazy memories of similar family holidays as a child were of slow days spent on pine-scented campsites, punctuated by trips to sun-soaked beaches. But here I was, a fully-fledged father, some quarter of a century later wondering what had gone wrong. Our journey to Argeles-sur-Mer on France’s Mediterranean coast went without a hitch, despite being in the minority of travellers flying, then hiring a car, rather than driving all the way. But the fatal decision was to try and wash the children, toddler Joe and five-year-old Anna, after arriving in a tired and tetchy state at Camping La Chapelle. Chris Greenwood stayed at Camping La Chappelle with his wife, Catherine, and children, Joe and Anna . Families congregated around the pools every afternoon for relief from the August heat . It was at this point I discovered that we didn’t have any hot water and the baby bath had a big hole in the bottom and no plug. With stubborn determination I slung the youngest over my shoulder, grabbed some towels and trudged off to the shower block. Minutes later he had showed me the error of my ways in the way that only toddlers can. And this was something I was left to chew over, as we quickly realised neither stubbornness nor determination have a place in this land of dappled sunlight, flip-flops and fresh baguettes. The children spent plenty of time in the pool, playing with the many new friends they made . Joe wears oversized sunglasses while relaxing by the pool at Camping La Chappelle in Argeles-sur-Mer . Instead over the next 10 days we threw ourselves at the mercy of campsite life, simply taking the path of least resistance. With hindsight, we should, of course, on that first night have just thrown the children into bed – dirt and all – and gone swimming first thing. Eurocamp (which has since absorbed Keycamp under its banner), and its stable of mobile home accommodation, provide everything you need to make a great success of simple pleasures like these. Things have come on a long way since I was a foot shorter and my family holidayed every year in tents across the south-west of France. The Greenwood family made several trips to the pleasant Argeles beach with its mountain backdrop . Multiple swimming pools, a kids club, swings and a bakery kept the Greenwoods busy during their stay . Lugging jerry cans of water back to our tent with its zip-up compartments and constant procession of ants had its charm, but so does double-glazing, a fully-fitted kitchen and air conditioning. We stayed in a Vista three-bedroom mobile home. It’s not huge, the bedrooms have the feel of a ship cabin, but it’s all there. The shower is decent with plenty of hot water – once the boiler has been sparked into life by a handy courier – and you’ve got your own loo and a decent size fridge. Two sets of doors lead out on to a deck, equipped with a gas-fired barbecue and, in our case, a permanent al fresco bath for Joe. Camping La Chapelle's biggest selling point is a fantastic swimming pool complex, including two water slides . Eurocamp offer sites for all types and tastes, and Camping La Chapelle is probably quite typical of a modern French campsite. This is certainly not your isolated enclave where you spend the evening listening only to the cicadas and warm wind rustling through the trees. Instead, you are likely to be able to hear the distant sounds of a German murdering a 1980s pop classic at karaoke night at the bar. But it’s a trade-off if you want somewhere lively and family orientated, which this campsite certainly is. In La Chapelle’s case, the biggest selling point is the fantastic swimming pool complex, including two water slides. There is even a heated pool with a retractable roof, under which we spent a memorable afternoon sheltering from a thunderstorm that rolled in from the Pyrenees. Joe and Anne, pictured with dad Chris, enjoyed the kids club, run by a team of dedicated workers . Families congregated around the pools every afternoon for relief from the August heat and Anna became an almost permanent fixture in the water, playing with the many new friends she’d made on the site. So the pool became a mainstay of our pleasant daily routine, which began with picking up freshly baked bread from the campsite bakery and ended with drinks and snacks on the deck. We quickly made use of the kids club, run by a small team of dedicated and enthusiastic couriers. Four hours of varied entertainment is on offer for children aged five to 12, six days of the week, and during our stay those in charge worked hard to build a rapport with their young charges from Britain, Ireland, Germany and Holland. Chris and Catherine get into the spirit at Camping La Chappelle's campsite 'Olympics' for children . Anna enjoyed games, crafts and an X-Factor-style talent show as the club proved a hub for families staying with Keycamp and its sister company Eurocamp. The two tribes were ultimately set against each other with an evening campsite ‘Olympics’, at which I am sad to report Eurocamp cleaned up. But not before our children had soaked their couriers to the skin in a bizarre game involving body paint, shouting and many, many bottles of water. As the days went on we settled into a pleasant routine, padding about the site between the bakery, kids club, swings and swimming pools. We did venture off site most mornings, making the 10-minute walk to the pleasant Argeles beach with its mountain backdrop and host of accessible cafes, bars and a mini-supermarket. When the Greenwoods weren't in the pool they spent time on the beach in the stunning port of Collioure . A little further afield was the stunning port of Collioure, once a magnet for artists including Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso. It really is a picture postcard place, with a little bay and beach perfect for swimming, surrounded by traditional French cafes, restaurants and arts and crafts boutiques. We went back twice to make sure we hadn’t missed anything in its winding maze of pretty streets. Once my wife and I found a new rhythm we pretty much all agreed that we could be Keycamp kind of people. We vowed never to force Joe to take a shower ever again though – at least not until he is big enough to take himself. Chris and his family stayed at Camping La Chapelle, Argeles-Sur-Mer, for 10 nights with Keycamp (www.eurocamp.co.uk or 0844 406 0319), which now operates under the Eurocamp banner. Eurocamp offer self-catering holidays at more than 160 sites across Europe, including popular regions like the Dordogne, Holland and central Italy. From May 25, 2015, a seven-night stay in a two-bedroom Esprit mobile home at Camping La Chapelle starts at £427. Peak season flights with easyJet to Montpellier from Gatwick start at £65 each way, plus baggage. Chris hired a car with Europcar, which cost around £250 for 10 days, including two child seats and unlimited mileage.
The stylist behind singer Rita Ora's unique, over-the-top hairstyles has revealed how much work the chart-topper has to put into ensuring her blonde locks remain totally healthy. Chris Appleton, who has been working with natural brunette Rita, 24, for the past two years, confessed to Daily Mail Online that her demanding haircare routine does require a hefty amount of work and 'maintenance'. 'We have to color the hair every three weeks,' he explained. 'We've managed to get the timing perfect so that she's not coloring it all the time. If you keep bleaching it, you push it too far and it can look awful, which has been done in the past by other celebrities! Scroll down for video . Style icon: Chris Appleton (R) has been working as singer Rita Ora's hairstylist for two years . Haircare regimen: According to Chris, Rita's blonde locks need to be colored every three weeks, a process which can dry out the hair if done too frequently . 'I also make my own hair masks, which I make her sleep in, to ensure that her hair stays in the best condition possible. 'I'm so strict with Rita, I want to make sure that her hair always looks great, and that means a lot of work. When she has any spare time, I make her condition.' But despite the seemingly endless hours of maintenance required in order to keep Rita's barnet looking its best, Chris insists that the singer isn't planning to follow in Kim Kardashian's footsteps and make a change to brunette any time soon. 'Blonde is such a statement, despite the fact that it's a lot of maintenance behind the scenes,' he said. 'We've never done anything deep or dark and we change the actual style so much that I'm eager to keep the color consistent.' The singer did have a chance to experiment with a darker hairstyle when she appeared in the recently-released Fifty Shades of Grey movie however; Rita's role as Mia, the younger sister of charismatic businessman Christian Grey, saw her don an extremely short, dark wig, which Chris believes helped Rita to separate herself from the character. Innovation: Every hairstyle that Rita models has something unique and different about it. 'I always want to do something to make her hair look special,' Chris explains . The girl with the pearl... hair: This embellished hairstyle is one of Chris' favorites . 'It worked for the film, because she wasn't Rita, she was Mia Grey, and I think that was a good thing,' Chris said. 'But I don't know if it's a style we will be trying out on Rita in real life!' While Rita might not be planning to replicate Mia's severe hairstyle any time soon however, Chris says that she is certainly not averse to experimenting with a variety of different looks - be they temporary, or permanent. Indeed, the decision to cut Rita's hair into a much shorter style just a few months ago was actually made on a whim, during a late-night styling session. 'I was talking to Rita about chopping her hair for a year, but it was about finding the right time,' he explained. 'Then at two in the morning, I was working on her hair, and we'd been doing it for hours, and she just said: "I think it's time." 'She called me the next day and was so happy with it, which was great. And it looks amazing, it was just a bit weird that we decided to do it then and there so late at night, or early in the morning I guess.' CopyKaty: According to Chris, singer Katy Perry recreated two of Rita's hairstyles for her This is How We Do video . Something different: For her role as Mia Grey in the recently-released movie Fifty Shades of Grey, Rita had the chance to experiment with darker locks . And beyond the length and color of Rita's hair, Chris is determined to ensure that her style is always fresh, unique and interesting, and is often experimenting with different textures, embellishments and colorful accessories. 'Sometimes I get a lot of time to work on a look - I'll know what outfit she's planning to wear for a red carpet, or an appearance, and I can plan accordingly,' he explained. 'Other times, I don't really get any time at all and I just have to pull it out of the bag! 'But I always want to do something to make her hair look special; if she's wearing a really detailed dress and we want the hair to be more simple, I'll do something really subtle - like the gold leaf that we used in her parting at the 2014 Met Gala. 'But if we want to go all out, then we'll work with loads of different accessories, or colors. I loved when we sewed loads of pearls into her hair, I thought that looked amazing. And it was so different and unique.' 'It's all about the details - I’m all about adding details to the hair. People will watch, [so] make it worthwhile.' Put a ring on it: Chris and Rita will often work together in order to come up with a new and unique way of accessorizing her hairstyle . Twisted: Rita often showcases Chris' work on her Instagram account . While Chris admits that he and Rita don't always see eye-to-eye about what hairstyle they should go for, he adds that she is always willing to go the extra mile in order to create something that is totally unique. And it seems that the seemingly endless hours Rita and Chris have spent working on maintaining and perfecting her varied hairstyles have more than paid off, with many of the more elaborate styles inspiring numerous other celebrities and style icons to create similar looks. 'The people behind the new Star Wars movie loved the hair we created for the UK version of The Voice [on which Rita is a judge] so much that they are going to use it in their next film,' Chris revealed. 'Katy Perry also did a similar style to the gelled baby hair that Rita had at Coachella for her This is How We Do video. 'The same look was also used at a number of fashion shows including DKNY and Givenchy.' 'Chris is incredibly talented,' Rita says of her ongoing relationship with the hairstylist. 'We work so well together drawing inspiration from any number of things - from Marilyn Monroe to London street fashion. Chris is always up for creating real moments, trying something different while keeping me smiling the whole way.'
A British businessman and his partner were arrested in Hong Kong yesterday after their 15-year-old daughter fell to her death from their £7.5million apartment. Nick Cousins, 57, and Grace Garcia Cousins, 53, were held over alleged 'ill treatment' of their child after it emerged that her birth, and that of her 14-year-old sister, were never registered and they did not attend school. The couple were also being questioned by police over claims that Filipino Mrs Cousins had overstayed her visa. The 15-year-old daughter of Briton Nick Cousins (left) and his partner Grace (right) fell to her death from their multi-million pound flat in Hong Kong . Police said the girl, Blanca Cousins (right) had been unhappy and a police source said she locked herself in a bathroom before falling to her death as her parents tried to unlock the door . Police sources say Blanca (pictured) was watching television in the apartment's master bedroom while her parents watched TV in the living room shortly before the tragedy . A police spokeswoman said a security guard found Blanca lying on the ground at the foot of the apartment block shortly after 1.46am . Tragedy: Blanca fell to her death in an apparent suicide early on Tuesday morning after locking herself in a bathroom of the apartment in Hong Kong's exclusive 3 Repulse Bay Road (pictured) Mr Cousins, originally from Thurrock, Essex, is managing director of the Hong Kong arm of international insurance broking firm Jardine Lloyd Thompson, and has worked for the firm in Asia for more than 20 years. There were claims last night that Mrs Cousins had originally moved to Hong Kong from the Philippines in the 1990s and worked as a domestic helper before becoming the partner of Mr Cousins. It is unclear whether they had married, although she uses his surname. It is believed the couple had been watching television in the family's home on the 21st floor of one of Hong Kong's most luxurious apartment buildings before Blanca's mother found her daughter was locked in a bathroom shortly before 2am. Blanca fell to her death from a window just before dawn. Paramedics declared her dead at the foot of the building in Repulse Bay. Police sources claimed while no suicide note had been found they were aware the girl had been 'unhappy' in recent weeks. The girl's father has been named as Nick Cousins (pictured) the managing director of insurance broker Jardine Lloyd Thompson's Hong Kong office . Blanca – who was known as Blancs – was due to celebrate her 16th birthday in July. She was a member of the Hong Kong Pony Club and was understood to have been educated at a private tuition centre along with her younger sister. School attendance is mandatory in Hong Kong, but a more relaxed approach is taken with expatriate residents and some 'home school' their children without official permission. However, not having their births registered meant the girls would not have been able to get either compulsory identity cards or passports to pass through the territory's strictly controlled borders, which suggests they spent their entire lives in Hong Kong. Last night, one expat who knows Mr Cousins described the family as 'down to earth and decent'. He added: 'He isn't a Hooray Henry at all, like so many of the expats in top jobs in Hong Kong. He's more of an Essex-boy type who worked his way up the corporate ladder and is just very bright and very good at what he does.' Both of the Cousins girls appeared to have a wide circle of friends among the city's well-to-do expatriate community. Carla Cousins – Blanca's younger sister – recently posted pictures on Facebook revealing that her father had a company box at last month's Hong Kong Sevens rugby tournament and invited friends to join her at the event. The 21-storey apartment block is one of the city's most prestigious addresses, with four-bedroom apartments selling for £7.5million each while they rent for £8,000 a month. The 21-storey apartment is one of the wealthy city's most prestigious addresses with luxury four-bedroom apartments selling for prices in the region of £7.5million . A police source last night said: 'Initial investigations showed there were no suspicious circumstances and [Blanca] was suspected to have fallen from a height. 'We arrested a 53-year-old Filipino female for overstaying and a 58-year-old British male for aiding and abetting an overstayer. 'Both have also been arrested for suspected ill treatment of the girl. Our investigations indicate the girl was unhappy with her life.' Last night a spokesman for the Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group said: 'We can confirm that our colleague Nick Cousins, the managing director of our Hong Kong office, has suffered the loss of his eldest daughter in tragic circumstances. We are giving Nick our full support through this difficult time and he will be on compassionate leave until further notice. 'We are aware that the authorities are investigating a number of matters that have come to light in the wake of this tragic event. As these are private matters, it would not be appropriate for us to comment further. 'Our thoughts are with Nick and his family.' Mrs Cousins was last night still being questioned over allegedly overstaying her original visa while Mr Cousins was released on bail.

A New York woman who appealed to her Facebook friends last week asking to pray for the safe return of her fiance who went missing 11 days ago after his kayak capsized has now been charged with his murder. The Orange County district attorney's office said Thursday that 35-year-old Angelika Graswald, of Poughkeepsie, is charged with second-degree murder in the death of 46-year-old Vincent Viafore. Troopers have said Viafore, also of Poughkeepsie, was kayaking with Graswald on the Hudson River April 19 when his vessel flipped over near the town of Cornwall-On-Hudson. Scroll down for video . Merry widow: Angelika Graswald (left), 35, has been charged with second-degree murder in the death of her missing fiance Vincent Viafore (right) Graswald called 911 telling the dispatcher she had fallen out of her own kayak. She was later picked up by a boater. Police have yet to find Viafore's body. According to a criminal complaint unveiled Thursday afternoon, prosecutors allege that Graswald intentionally caused Viafore's death. The complaint states that rough waters combined with strong winds caused Viafore’s kayak to overturn. The man was not wearing a life jacket at the time and was unable to turn the capsized boat right-side up. Authorities did not specify what led them to conclude that Graswald was responsible for her fiance's death, only saying that she had made statements implicating herself in the crime. She was arraigned Thursday and ordered held without bail at the Orange County Jail with no bail. She is due back in court May 5. In the days leading up to her arrest, Graswald had been active on her Facebook page, sharing cellphone videos of her cat and uploading a dozen romantic photos of her and Viafore from their time together. As recently as Tuesday, she shared a picture of the happy couple at a lakeside cabin, accompanied by the caption: 'I miss you, my love...' Lingering questions: According to a criminal complaint, prosecutors allege that Graswald intentionally caused Viafore's death - but they wouldn't say how she did it . 'Clever ruse': She managed to make it out of the water and call 911. Last Monday, she asked friends on Facebook to keep praying for her partner and hoped for a miracle . The couple, who had been together for many years, were kayaking on the Hudson River between Plum Point and Bannerman’s Island at around 7.30pm April 19 when Viafore's vessel overturned, sending him into the frigid water. Initially, police believed that Graswald tried to help her fiance and fell into the water. She was eventually scooped up by a passing boat and called 911 after reaching land to report Viafore missing. The 35-year-old was taken to hospital and treated for hypothermia but her fiance has not been found. Viafore's friend Wes Gottlock said he saw them out on the water, but did not discover there was a search underway until later on that evening. A friend in need: Initially, police believed that Graswald tried to help her fiance and fell into the water . Doomed: Viafore was not wearing a life jacket. He was unable to get back into the kayak . Keeping up appearance: In the days leading up to her arrest, Graswald had been active on her Facebook page, sharing cellphone videos of her cat and uploading a dozen romantic photos of her and Viafore . He added that the couple had been together for a long time and have a 'wonderful relationship'. He said the water at this time of the year is 'precarious' as the water is still cold. Last Monday, she asked friends for their prayers as the search continued. She wrote on Facebook: 'I just want to thank everyone for reaching out. Please, keep your prayers for Vince. 'Miracles ARE possible. The authorities are doing everything they can. 'We do not need anyone else getting hurt, as it is very dangerous out there, especially without daylight. Please, no questions at this point, we're doing everything we can. We will find him.'

Having gone all the way to last year’s Wimbledon final Eugenie Bouchard has shown she knows how to handle etiquette, including the anachronistic task of having to curtsey. Yet something as straightforward as a sporting handshake at a low-key draw ceremony, before representing Canada in a Fed Cup match at the weekend, seems to be beyond her. Her refusal to shake hands with Romanian opponent Alexandra Dulgheru turned out to be the precursor of a dreadful few days for the world no 7. It beings to symbolise a season fast unravelling for last year’s shooting star of the women’s game. Eugenie Bouchard was mocked at home and abroad over the handshake controversy . Bouchard refused to shake the hand of Alexandra Dulgheru before Fed Cup match at the weekend . Bouchard ended up suffering not just the humiliation of losing to far lesser ranked opponents in front of her hometown crowd in Montreal, but of being mocked by the opposing Romanian team after they had inflicted defeat. Moreover, having previously been able to do little wrong in the eyes of her compatriots, she brought upon herself the scorn of fair-minded Canadians in the media, social and otherwise. Even Romania’s world number three Simona Halep, a shy and retiring type, weighed in by casting aspersions about the kind of upbringing Bouchard has had. Bouchard explained away her graceless act as merely being true to herself, but the truth is that such brattish behaviour is neither principled nor smart. She would be well-advised to avoid this sort of bravado until she starts winning again. It is not the first time that Bouchard has declined the traditional shake of hands that takes place at the draw prior to matches in the Fed Cup, the women’s incomprehensible equivalent of the Davis Cup. She did the same last year to Slovakia’s Kristina Kucova in front of the cameras which have, again, spread the footage all over the internet. The 21-year-old Canadian broke into the world's top 10 after a superb 2014 . She lost both her singles matches to world No 69 Dulgheru and Andreea Mitu, ranked 104th . Romania's Dulgheru said the handshake snub had given her extra motivation for the match . “It wasn’t personal, I just don’t believe in wishing my opponent good luck before a match,” said Bouchard this time. Already bereft of confidence, she set herself up for a fall which duly came, losing both her singles to players ranked 69 and 104. After Dulgheru beat her in straight sets she celebrated with her team-mates by theatrically pulling away her hand before it could be shaken. Dugheru said afterwards the incident had added to her motivation and gleefully declared that it was ‘nothing personal’. The watching Halep told Romanian reporters : “I would never have done it but this is how she (Bouchard) is raised or it’s a habit.” A superb 2014 saw Bouchard fly into the top ten at a rate few expected, the highlight being her run to the final of SW19. But by the same token this was never likely to be an easy year for the Canadian. A sympathetic view would be that the pressure of backing up two Grand Slam semis and a final is enormous, and that it is clearly starting tell. Bouchard reached last year’s Wimbledon final, where she lost to Petra Kvitova . There is also a sneaking admiration for the way she refuses to get involved in the sometimes phoney mateyness that permeates the men’s locker room. Not for Bouchard the guff that she is ‘pleased’ for her opponents when they do well. She happily declares with a smile that is half-angelic, half-steely that she is not interested in being friends with her rivals. That is just one reason she is often compared to Maria Sharapova. At times she appears to take the Russian ice queen as her ultimate role model but whether she can ever be technically as good as her is much more open to question. After making a decent start to this year by reaching the quarter finals of the Australian Open Bouchard has now lost six matches out of eight and five straight. While going down to Ukrainian qualifier Lesia Tusrenko at Indian Wells from 4-1 she was in tears. She also struggled to control her emotions later in March at Miami, when losing to world number 113 Tatjana Maria, whose main claim to fame is that she is the highest ranked mother on the tour. Bouchard has enjoyed success off the court with her model looks . Bouchard has often been compared to Russian ice queen Maria Sharapova . Bouchard made a couple of big decisions in December that may have added to the pressure. She curiously failed to renew her agreement with respected veteran American coach Nick Saviano that had worked so well, with one source suggesting he became aggrieved by her side’s high handed negotiating stance. She is now with Sam Sumyk, former coach of Sharapova’s fellow shrieker and ex world number one Victoria Azarenka. After eight years Bouchard also switched management companies to WME/IMG, which has offered her the chance to work with the IMG Models division and take commercial advantage of the looks she is so blessed with. Bouchard also has a strong work ethic, and has shown herself to be ruthless, intelligent and articulate (more shades of Sharapova). Her emergence has undoubtedly boosted the women’s game and at 21 everyone makes mistakes. After this weekend a period concentrating on avoiding them, and focussing on repairs to her tennis game would seem a wise move.

The Rangers board have held their first meeting with Mike Ashley since assuming control at Ibrox. Interim chairman Paul Murray and director John Gilligan held talks with Ashley and other members of the Sports Direct hierarchy on Wednesday. While no details of the discussions have been disclosed, supporters will hope it may represent an initial step towards finding an amicable way forward with the billionaire owner of Newcastle United. Controversial Sports Direct and Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley has secured an 8.92 stake in Rangers . Murray, Gilligan and Dave King ousted Ashley allies Derek Llambias and Barry Leach from the Ibrox board at an EGM on March 6 and have since spent time studying all the club's existing contracts and commercial arrangements. Sports Direct loaned the previous Rangers regime £5million in January, receiving security over various assets – including club trademarks – in return. They also have the right, yet to be exercised, to appoint two directors to the board. That deal also saw Ashley's firm take a 75 per cent grip of the Rangers Retail subsidiary, increasing their stranglehold over merchandising income. The new Ibrox board last month revealed they would not be drawing down the second £5 million available from Sports Direct, instead accepting a £1.5 million loan from the Three Bears consortium for short-term financing while they formulate a longer-term funding plan. Ashley owns an 8.92 per cent stake in Rangers, with the SFA rejecting an approach to raise his current 10 per cent limit late last year.

The headline sounds almost too good to be true, doesn't it? But this one is perhaps as close to a sure bet as you'll find - the secret to winning at Two Up, Australia's iconic game of chance. Punting analyst Mike Steward has outlined an approach, known in gambling parlance as the Martingale Betting Strategy.The staking plan is outlined in the table below, but seems simple enough to follow for even a first-time Two Up player. The essence being, that if you lose, you have to double your bet until your coins fall right. A word to the wise however, there is, as with any supposed sure-bet, or an almost can't lose system, a catch - and that is that you'll need a healthy bank of cash with you. Scroll down for video . Scenes like these will be repeated across Australia on ANZAC Day this Saturday, heaving crowds of punters betting on the toss of coins in games of Two Up . The Martingale Betting Strategy of doubling up originated in France and is used with levels of success by punters on ANZAC Day throughout Australia . The traditional game of Two Up involves two coins but many venues now play with three for ease of betting among the crowd . Two Up is one of Australia's longest lasting traditions, it dates back to Australia's goldfields and the first recorded games are believed to have taken place in the late 1790s. It is now legal to be played on ANZAC Day across Returned Servicemen League clubs (RSL) and pubs. Versions will vary between the original two-coined game (with three outcomes) and three-coined version (with two outcomes), the latter preferred by many venues prefer for ease of betting between punters. 'One of the most easy to understand betting staking strategies that punters use is what I call the approach, otherwise known as the Martingale Betting Strategy,' writes Mr Steward, author of 'Betting Strategy doubles up to win' for the website Punters Club Hero. It's a system of betting which originated in France. 'A punter simply bets a stake to win an amount of money, if they fail to win with the first bet they increase their stake to recover their losses plus win the initial targeted win amount on the second bet and so on,' he added.

'I bet $1 on Heads for the first toss to win $1. 'If the bet loses, I will bet $2 on the second toss. If I win on the second toss I have recovered my earlier loss of $1 plus my target winning amount of $1, otherwise if I lose I will have to bet $4 on the third toss to recover the $3 lost and still win my targeted win amount. 'If I continued to experience successive losses I double the stake of the previous wager until a win occurs.' 'The Martingale staking approach is alluring to punters because of its seemingly guaranteed approach to make a buck,' he stated. 'I mean how many losers can you back in a row after all? The game was still illegal in some Australian states and territories up until 10 years ago. Wagering expert Damian Deguara, who writes for website The Great Tip Off, told Daily Mail Australia that: 'It's that one time of the year when the law permits men and women across this great country of ours to follow in the footsteps of our brave Aussie diggers and keep to the old gambling tradition.' 'Two Up is a pretty simple game, all you need are coins, a wooden stick (the kip) to flip them into the air and a crowd of screaming punters yelling "Heads" or "Tails". 'Most punters have their corner, you are either a Heads punter, a Tails punter or someone who goes with either depending on your intuition. 'The Double-up approach is alluring to punters because it seems to provide a guaranteed approach to making a buck. If you win you're happy and if you lose you increase your stake until you win. 'Sounds easy enough right? But what are the real odds of winning and losing if you chose to use the Double-up approach on ANZAC Day? 'Think back to ANZAC Day last year and recall how many successive loses that a Head or a Tail endured over the entire day. Was it four, five? 'What are the chances of experiencing six losses in a row? It's actually about two per cent but that means it is actually possible. 'On the bright side there is a 98 per cent chance that you would have made your money before this point.' 'Come in Spinner' is the cry from the Ringkeeper at Two Up games . The coins fly into the air during a game of Two Up, the uniquely Australian tradition, in which punters bet on which way coins land. It is celebrated on ANZAC Day on April 25 and is associated with soldiers because it was popular with troops during World War I . Australian Army soldiers pictured playing Two Up. "There is no form guide or books written on pushing the odds in your favour, as two-up is one of the fairest bets in the world. For every two-up coin toss there are two possible outcomes, Heads or Tails, and punters receive even money if the coins turn-up the right way, which is as true as the odds can get,' said wagering guru Damian Deguara . Versions of Two Up will vary between the original two-coined game (with three outcomes) and three-coined version (with two outcomes), which many venues prefer for ease of betting between punters. Spinner at the ready with the wooden Kip which is used to toss the coins. 'The thing to remember is that each time you lose, the probability of winning the next bet in the example given is still even money' warn some professional punters . 'The attractiveness of this approach is certainly strong, however the downside, although rare in the example given, is very significant,' Mr Steward added. 'If successive losses continue, the amount that needs to be wagered increases significantly. 'The other thing to remember is that each time you lose, the probability of winning the next bet in the example given is still even money. 'The odds don't change because you have already incurred such significant losses. 'I spoke with an ex on-line betting executive recently and asked if the Martingale betting approach was common amongst punters and he indicated that it was noted frequently. 'He mentioned a time when a punter endured 16 consecutive losses in-a-row with the last $69,000 bet failing before it appeared as though his bankroll had run out. "That's the problem with this approach that most punters do not realise" he said. "It only guarantess success if you have an infinite amount of cash". Mr Deguara offered a similar warning: 'Before you run off to the ATM to load yourself up in readiness for a Double-up day of two-up, remember that the perception of guaranteed success that punters have about the Double-up approach is not entirely accurate.' 'The only way that it can guarantee a win is if you have an infinite amount of cash and an infinite number of coin tosses, neither of which are available to punters tomorrow.' Two Up is one of Australia's longest lasting traditions and is legal to be played on ANZAC Day across Returned Servicemen League clubs (RSL) and pubs and has been permitted for Australian and New Zealand troops deployed overseas during this time of year .
Adele Sarno (above) has been living in her two-bedroom apartment for more than 50 years . An Italian-American grandmother is facing eviction from her $820-a-month apartment in Manhattan's Little Italy neighborhood. Adele Sarno, 85, who has lived there for more than 50 years received a letter seeking to increase rent to the market rate of $3,500 a month, far more than the retired shopkeeper can afford. Her landlord is the Italian American Museum which is dedicated to the legacy of Italian-Americans and is situated below her home. The fight over her two-bedroom apartment began five years ago. 'Why would you want to throw me out when I lived here all my life?' asked Sarno, a feisty, raspy-voiced woman who proudly tells how she once even served as queen of the annual Feast of San Gennaro, Little Italy's most well-known event. 'This is my neighborhood.' She has been living in the apartment since 1962 when rent was only $150 a month, according to CBS. The spat is the latest involving the museum to cause a commotion in Little Italy, a neighborhood of former tenement buildings and narrow streets in Lower Manhattan that was once a bustling center of Italian immigrant life. An Italian restaurant that had been open for decades closed its doors last week in a separate rent-related dispute. 'The negative press that this has caused is so detrimental to the spirit of the Italian immigrant,' said Lou Di Palo, whose family has run an Italian specialty foods shop in Little Italy for over a century. 'I'm upset over it.' Scroll down for video . The grandmother tried to go through the courts to see if the city's rent regulation laws could help, but it was determined that her apartment wasn't covered (Adele pictured above in her Little Italy apartment) Her landlord is the Italian American Museum (above) which is dedicated to the legacy of Italian-Americans and is situated below her home. They sent her a letter five years ago seeking to increase rent to $3,500 . But in recent decades, the character of Little Italy has been transformed by waves of gentrification and wealthy newcomers. The latest Census data from 2013 shows only 554 out of 7,816 residents, about seven per cent, in the Census tract encompassing Sarno's street identify as having Italian ancestry. Museum president Joseph Scelsa told The New York Times that even after all Italian-Americans had gone from the area, 'the legacy would still remain because we have an institution that does that.' Neither the museum's president nor its spokesman replied to multiple emails and phone messages from The Associated Press seeking comment. But they have said the museum is looking to expand its space, or sell the properties to a developer and remain there rent-free. Sarno, who has a daughter in Wisconsin and a granddaughter on Staten Island, believes the museum is just after more money, pointing out that her upstairs neighbors pay several thousand dollars a month in rent. The grandmother tried to go through the courts to see if the city's rent regulation laws could help, but it was determined that her apartment wasn't covered. Still, she is hopeful she can fight through the courts to forestall the eviction order. A judge has given her lawyers until April 13 to find some kind of solution. Il Palazzo, the shuttered restaurant, was evicted after being in business since the 1980s. Adele Sarno poses for picture in her apartment in the Little Italy section of Manhattan on March 31, 2015 . Sarno believes the museum is just after more money as her neighbors pay several thousand dollars a month in rent she said . Perry Chrisciatelli, who ran the restaurant with his wife, said they had been late with a $17,000 rent payment in February, and were told they would have to go unless they were willing to pay almost twice that per month. 'Now another piece of Little Italy is gone,' he said. Truthfully, there's not a lot of Little Italy left, mainly a couple of blocks of Mulberry Street, populated with Italian restaurants and tourist stores featuring trinkets and 'Kiss me, I'm Italian' and 'Fuggedaboutit' T-shirts. 'The sort of everyday lived experience of the place as a residence of Italian Americans for all intents has been over for decades,' said Joseph Sciorra of the Italian-American Institute at Queens College. But for a museum dedicated to that history, turning Sarno out shows 'a lack of vision,' he said, suggesting it could have tapped Sarno as a speaker or in some other capacity. Sarno, he said, 'is literally the living embodiment of the living history of Little Italy.' On Saturday, a rally was held in support of Sarno keeping her apartment as protesters gathered outside of the museum to protest. The grandmother was due to be evicted on Monday but a judge has given her lawyers until April 13 to find a solution.
It's normally Steffon Armitage who triggers it, but this time it is Nick Abendanon’s doing. He played so well for Clermont Auvergne last weekend – again – that England’s policy against picking players based abroad is back in focus. For the umpteenth time, the RFU and Stuart Lancaster are being urged to invoke the ‘exceptional circumstances’ get-out clause. There is an assumption in many quarters that, this being a World Cup year, it is time to abandon all principles and do whatever it takes to ensure that every Englishman, wherever he may be, is available for selection. Well, here’s an alternative suggestion. Scrap the clause. Now. It is proving to be more hassle than it is worth. Lancaster, his assistants and his employers are being stalked by calls for Armitage to be called into the national squad, as befitting his supreme exploits for Toulon. But that is to ignore the coaches’ reservations, and the realisation that the fall-out from a shift in policy would have long-term repercussions. Former Bath full back Nick Abendanon was outstanding for Clermont as they tore Saracens to shreds . Toulon flanker Steffon Armitage has been one of the standout forwards in Europe in recent seasons . Harlequins director of rugby Conor O'Shea believes the 'exceptional' clause could cause major problems . England hooker Tom Youngs also thinks the clause could create tension in the current international set-up . This is not to decry a quality flanker who has excelled among the Galacticos at his club, but this situation cannot go on. England are being held hostage by their own edict, so why not just ditch the ‘exceptional’ clause and end the out-cry? Critics of the union’s stance over-look the consequences for the club game in this country if there is no restriction in place. This column concurs with Conor O’Shea, who said: ‘It is pure populism to say it is World Cup year and we should do anything we can because the minute you break that (policy), you break the dam. There are always exceptional circumstances. Then there will be the next one and the next one and the next one.’ Leicester’s England hooker, Tom Youngs added: ‘I don’t know how well it would go down with the team. Stuart has built a culture with this group of players. Does he want to disrupt it?’ The 'exceptional' clause rule has continued to heap pressure on Stuart Lancaster and his coaching staff . Fair point. Tell players they have to stay to be considered, then at the 11th hour perform a U-turn and select exiles; that is a short-cut to unrest, surely? This is no restraint of trade either – those who wish to go abroad can do so freely, but the knock-on effect is clear. Well, it is reasonably clear. It would be clearer still if the RFU and England really had the courage of their convictions and abolished the clause entirely. Sam Burgess’s heavily-scrutinised conversion to rugby union will take an intriguing twist on Friday night, when he starts at blindside flanker for Bath against Newcastle at Kingston Park. He has been striving to make an impact in midfield for four months, but his club’s head coach, Mike Ford, insisted long ago that back row would be his ultimate home. There are potential implications for Burgess’s quest to earn a place in England’s World Cup squad, as Lancaster sees him as a candidate to play at inside centre. Sam Burgess's rugby evolution continues on Friday as he starts at blindside flanker against Newcastle . However, despite widespread misgivings about the former league icon’s exploits to date in his new code, he will be included in England’s training squad announced next month, providing he is fit. That is a given. In addition, any further doubts about Manu Tuilagi’s health will further enhance Burgess’s prospects of making it to the World Cup – as a powerful ball-carrier who can break tackles and off-load. The England coaches will back themselves to mould him to their vision, given three months to do so. Finally, the back-row experiment makes sense. Burgess needs the ball in his hands more, in order to make his presence felt, so wearing No 6 addresses that. When it comes to matchday atmosphere, the Stade Marcel Michelin is hard to beat . It is well documented that English clubs cannot compete with their French rivals when it comes to transfer-market clout, but they are also being eclipsed in the atmosphere stakes too. Last weekend, the cacophony at Stade Marcel Michelin – for Clermont vs Northampton – was on a different level to anything experienced here. In this observer’s opinion, the noise and colour at Stade Felix Mayol the next day, as Wasps took on holders Toulon, was similar, if not quite as relentlessly raucous. Many Premiership grounds are full, but they lack the constant bedlam to be found in the best Gallic arenas. The Millennium Stadium when a big Test is on takes some beating, while Thomond Park, Limerick, is the spiritual home of supporter fanaticism, closely followed by Ravenhill when Ulster play under lights. Munster's home stadium Thomond Park is another fortress that generates a unique atmosphere . But Clermont lead the atmosphere league table. It’s not necessarily a great place to go in support of doomed visitors, but those who haven’t been should try it as neutrals, for a big French Top 14 clash. The place produces an epic occasion founded on fervent civic pride. CORBISIERO'S STRUGGLES RAISE DOUBTS . When certain players go down in pain and require treatment on the field, there is a particular sense of foreboding. Alex Corbisiero is in that category. The Northampton prop didn’t feature for England during the recent Six Nations and was forced off during the Saints’ thumping defeat at Clermont last weekend, apparently suffering discomfort in his right knee – which has been a problem area before. More recently, the Lions loosehead was laid low with a shoulder injury and he could be seen flexing that joint at Stade Marcel Michelin. Corbisiero hasn’t started a Test for England for 28 months. His club insist this latest setback is ‘only a bruise’, but there will be grave doubts about this world-class player’s ability to scale the heights again, until he plays regularly without mishap. Northampton prop Alex Corbisiero has not started a game for England in nearly two years . Saints and England lock Courtney Lawes is a doubt for his side's clash with Exeter on Sunday . Courtney Lawes has what Northampton are calling a ‘bad shoulder’ and may not feature in Sunday’s clash with Exeter. There was better news for Saracens on Thursday, as Jacques Burger will be available for their Champions Cup semi-final against Clermont, after escaping with a one-match ban for striking Maxime Machenaud of Racing Metro. LAST WORD . Now that he has been duly confirmed as one of the 12 referees appointed for the World Cup, Nigel Owens should just go ahead and book his room in the Twickenham area for the final on October 31. The Welshman is close to being a shoo-in for that showpiece occasion, unless his cause is shattered by Warren Gatland’s national team emerging from the ‘Pool of Death’ and going one step further than they did four years ago. It is no coincidence that Owens has presided over many of the greatest encounters at Test and club level in recent years. Nigel Owens (left) is the frontrunner to referee the World Cup final, unless Wales make it there of course . His empathy, style of communication and desire to let the game flow mean he is respected worldwide. He has acquired a high profile, but it does nothing to detract from his professionalism. Happily, this year’s tournament cannot be tarnished by the attention-seeking antics of Alain Rolland and Steve Walsh, who have both retired. Referees are there to monitor, adjudicate and facilitate, not try to up-stage the teams and players.
An Army major and his wife engaged in 'a regimen of abuse and neglect' with their three young foster children over a period of years that left the toddlers with broken bones and numerous other health problems, a federal prosecutor told a jury at the couple's child abuse trial Monday. John and Carolyn Jackson also forced some of the children to drink hot sauce or eat hot pepper flakes and weren't exposed until one of their biological children reported the abuse to someone outside the family, Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Shumofsky said in his opening statement. That child, now in his teens, is expected to provide key testimony for the prosecution. The trial marks the second go-round for the Jacksons, whose previous trial last fall ended in a mistrial when a prosecutor inadvertently referred to the fact that one of the children had died. Cruel: Army Major John Jackson (left) and his wife Carolyn (right) are currently on trial for abusing their three foster children. Pictured above in May 2013 . The judge had previously ruled that the boy's death could not be introduced during the trial since the defendants were not charged directly with his death. Second trial: The Jacksons first child abuse trial was ruled a mistrial when a prosecutor mentioned the death of one of their sons - a detail that was not supposed to be mentioned in the proceedings. The Jacksons had three biological children and three adopted children. They have only been charged for abusing the foster children . The Jacksons, who live in Mount Holly, were stationed at Picatinny Arsenal, a military installation about 40 miles west of New York City, when the abuse occurred between 2005 and 2010, according to a 15-count superseding indictment. They had three biological children who showed no signs of abuse, Shumofsky said. But they disciplined their three foster children by withholding food and water as punishment and by hitting them with different objects, he added. The treatment left them with bruises and injuries including, for one child, a skull fracture and spinal fracture, and for another, a broken arm. The children were well under normal weight when they were removed from the Jackson home, Shumofsky said, including one who weighed less at nearly three years old than he did when he joined the family at 11 months old. One of the girls had scars, marks and infections and had a dangerously high level of salt in her body that doctors said they'd never seen before in a two-year-old, Shumofsky told jurors. Attorneys representing the Jacksons conceded that though the Jacksons' child-rearing methods may be objectionable to some, they didn't rise to the level of criminality. 'You might think, `I would never raise a hand to my child,'' said attorney Rubin Sinins, representing Carolyn Jackson. 'But that doesn't make it criminal. Because what Carolyn Jackson was doing was acting in good faith in her role as parent.' Jackson would have had to have known that her actions would cause harm to be considered guilty, he added. 'If you're a crappy parent, you're not a criminal,' he said. Countering photos shown by Shumofsky that showed the children with visible marks and scars, Sinins showed jurors pictures of the two girls smiling with their parents or friends in pictures taken weeks earlier. Sinins and David Holman, representing John Jackson, both mentioned in their opening statements that while the government's experts concluded abuse had taken place though they hadn't treated the children, the children's treating doctors did not reach that conclusion.
The brave man who stood up against a neo-Nazi at an anti-Islam rally has spoken out about the poignant moment that was captured on camera. During the Reclaim Australia rallies on the Easter weekend, anti-racism protester Jacob King was snapped staring into the eyes of a bald man with a swastika tattooed behind his ear. Mr King, from Melbourne, told Daily Mail Australia he had his arms spread out because he thought the man was going to attack him and his fellow protesters at Federation Square. Anti-racism protester Jacob King, from Melbourne, had a face off with a neo-Nazi at the Easter weekend's Reclaim Australia rallies . Mr King was raised in Melbourne and says he lived in a multicultural part of the Victorian capital where he was exposed to racial tensions . The anti-racism protester said he learned Islamophobic views from a young age but thankfully managed to 'unlearn' these views' 'A few scuffles broke out as a result of those trying to push and fight their way through the picket lines,' he said. 'I remember looking at the bald man from the photo and it seemed to me that he and his group were there solely to be violent and express incoherent hatred, which took away from the already limited opportunities to engage in civilised discussion. 'I have however felt this kind of anger before, and this understanding produced in me a moment of unexpected compassion for him. 'I placed myself in between him and the anti-racism protesters. My arms were outstretched to keep people back and when the man got in my face I was expecting him to attack me. But he didn't. 'As he began to relax I told him there would be no more fighting today. I wasn't expecting him to comply so easily, but I respect him for doing so.' Mr King said he was born and had grown up in a multicultural part of Melbourne, where he had been on the giving and receiving ends of 'racial prejudice and bigoted views'. 'I learned Islamophobic views from a young age but thankfully managed to unlearn and re-learn enough to accept that many of my simplified views were irrational,' he said. 'I have learned that the vast majority of Australian Muslims have come to Australia to improve their lives, contribute to our society and are against the extremist interpretations of their faith which they are so often accused of holding. Mr King said he had spread out his arms to protect his fellow protesters because he thought the man and his group was going to attack them . Wearing a Harley Davidson sleeveless hoodie, which showed off his sleeve of tattoos, the bald man attempted to start a fight with the protesters against racism, who stood against him in defiance . 'I attended the anti-racism rally because I recognise that the issues raised by the rally co-ordinators are a direct result of the scapegoating and fear mongering of Muslims and other minorities by many in the corporate mainstream media and government. 'I firmly believe these divisions in our society are distracting us from the more immediate issues that should be of greater concern to all Australians.' Numerous images emerged showing fiery scenes around the nation, but the most striking picture was taken by photographer Kenji Wardenclyffe who captured Mr King during the Melbourne protest against the 'Islamisation' of Australia. The dramatic scenes occurred after Reclaim Australia, an anti-Islam group, organised protests at major cities across Australia, which were countered by anti-racism activists who held rallies in the same locations. The Reclaim Australia event in Melbourne was also crashed by neo-nazis, who spectacularly clashed with anti-racism groups. 'It was very intense,' Kenji Wardenclyffe told Daily Mail Australia. 'The neo-nazi definitely seemed to be instigating, trying to start a fight with the anti-racism group. The other man in the photo stepped in and was trying to keep the peace. 'He kept his hands open, he was trying to stop a fight from breaking out.' The violent intent of the bald man was proven elsewhere at the rally, when he was photographed with one fist gripping another protester's shirt and the other raised to punch the man in the face. Mr Wardenclyffe said he was pushed around by protesters throughout the day, and some of his camera equipment was broken by people attempting to stop him from taking photos. 'It was a very angry atmosphere - it definitely seemed some of the people on the Reclaim Australia side were there looking to start a fight,' he said. 'It was very tense.' Violent intent: At the rally, the man involved in the standoff was seen trying to throw a punch at another protester as the scene descended into violence . One man appeared to be knocked out cold in the melee and was left lying on the ground . The identification of Jacob King comes after a Federal Government MP reported a group 'socialist ratbags' who were seen burning the Australian flag at the rally to the Human Rights Commission. The trio were at a Reclaim Australia demonstration, the same rally where Mr King was photographed. George Christensen, member for Dawson in Queensland revealed on Tuesday after receiving 'a number of complaints' he had reported the 'clowns' who burnt the flag while protesting against the Reclaim Australia group. 'I have asked the Racial Discrimination Commissioner to investigate the protests to see if they are unlawful under Section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act,' Mr Christensen said. 'According to the Act, it is unlawful to perform any action in public that is likely to offend people of a particular race, religion, or national background. If sections of the Act can be applied to one race or nationality it must apply to all, whether a minority or the majority,' he also wrote. The rally was just one of a dozen which took place in cities across Australia on the Easter long weekend, organised by anti-Islam group Reclaim Australia.

George Christensen, member for Dawson in Queensland (left) revealed on Tuesday after receiving 'a number of complaints' he had reported the 'clowns' (right) In a video of the event, it also appears to show the moment a man throw a punch at the head of a female anti-racism protester. Despite Reclaim Australia's promise of a peaceful protest, a number of men with shaved heads and tattoos of the swastika appeared at the event and attempted to intimidate anti-racism protesters. Reclaim Australia describe themselves as 'patriotic Australians' who protest against Sharia Law, Halal tax and Islam. They say they want 'compulsory singing of our national anthem weekly in every school in Australia' and want the government to 'refuse entry to anyone who has fought overseas against our ADF or minimum 15 years jail term.' Police were forced to separate  supporters and opposing protesters by forming a wall at separate rallies across the country. Crowd numbers continued to grow throughout the afternoon, and some protesters had to be treated by paramedics after the ugly clashes. Police were forced to separate Reclaim Australia supporters and opposing protesters by forming a wall at separate rallies across the country . Speaking to Buzzfeed, photographer Wardenclyffe said one of the anti-racism protesters stood out in front of the rest to stop him from getting through. 'The neo-Nazi appeared and pushed through the crowd and began to yell at the (left-wing protestors),' Mr Wardenclyffe said. 'The neo-Nazi then got in the face of the man in my photo with sunglasses who had moved into a position to prevent him from getting through. 'The neo-Nazi yelled at him in a manner which seemed to be an attempt to start a fight, but the guy with sunglasses remained calm and didn't engage.' A clash of anti-Islam and anti-racism groups turned dangerous and violent during protests in Melbourne . Melbourne police formed a barrier between the separate rallies to attempt to disperse the protesters . It comes after a Twitter account claiming to be linked with anti-Islam groups has mocked protests . There was never a violent exchange between the groups however the men with the swastika's moved through the crowd taunting the anti-racism protesters. The clash comes after a Twitter account claiming to be linked with anti-Islam groups mocked  protests being held around Australia last week. However, organisers behind the Sydney protest were quick to disassociate themselves with the account. Crowd numbers grew during the afternoon, and some protesters had to be treated by paramedics . Across Australia, 16 rallies were scheduled to take place, but Sydney and Melbourne drew the biggest crowd . 'It's not us,' a spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia. 'Ours is @reclaim_aus.' Across the country, 16 rallies were scheduled to take place, with events in Sydney and Melbourne appearing to have drawn the biggest crowds. About 500 people attended the rally held in Martin Place, Sydney, which included speeches from former Australia Defence League member Shermon Burgess and Rise Up! Australia Party NSW President Norm Bishop. Two people were taken away by police officers after they rushed the stage and attempted to disrupt the rally . More than 100 police officers, eleven mounted on horses were used to form the separation wall . Several were injured during the violent rally that saw hundreds of people protest for anti-racism . There was a strong police presence throughout the protest, which included riot police. Two people were taken away by officers after they rushed the stage and attempted to disrupt the rally. One took the microphone and told the crowd they should be 'ashamed'. Several more were injured in the combative protests, according to reports.

Nicola Sturgeon today warned Ed Miliband that time is running out on her offer to help lock the Tories out of power. The SNP leader has said she is prepared to work with Labour to put Mr Miliband in Number 10, even if David Cameron's Conservatives win more seats. Ms Sturgeon was today swamped with requests for selfies in the wake of her triumph in last week's live TV debate, as polls suggest a surge in support for the SNP will cost Labour a majority on May 7. Scroll down for video . Nicola Sturgeon today warned Ed Miliband that time is running out on her offer to help lock the Tories out of power . The SNP is projected to win more than 40 seats in Scotland at the election, potentially leaving them holding the balance of power if Labour and the Tories both fall short. Ms Sturgeon has refused to work with the Conservatives under any circumstances, but has held out the possibility of putting Mr Miliband into power. She has suggested a full-blown coalition, with SNP ministers in the Cabinet, is unlikely to be the outcome. But her MPs could vote to prop up a Labour minority administration, raising the prospect of a Scottish-backed government over-ruling the views of a majority in England. Labour leader Ed Miliband is forecast to lose dozens of seats to the SNP after a sharp drop in support in Scotland . However, today Ms Sturgeon made clear he patience is wearing thin, and called on Mr Miliband to respond to her offer. She claimed that every day that passes risks fuelling the impression that Mr Miliband would rather see the Conservatives return to government than work with the SNP. Addressing supporters in Livingston, Ms Sturgeon insisted the SNP is not seeking any UK ministerial posts. But said she will fight for as much power for Scotland as she can get. Her predecessor as First Minister Alex Salmond  has already vowed to hold a Labour minority government to ransom to secure a £180billion debt-fuelled spending spree in Scotland. Ms Sturgeon said: 'Even if the Tories are the largest party, I have said we will vote to stop the Tory government getting off the ground,' she said. 'I have asked Ed Miliband to confirm that Labour will do likewise. Thus far, Labour hasn't given that commitment. 'I hope to hear him give that commitment before too much more time elapses because as long as he fails to give that commitment he leaves lingering the suspicion that Labour would rather see the Tories get back into power than work with the SNP. 'If that is the case, then people in Scotland, I don't think, will ever forgive the Labour Party.' She added: 'I have said a formal coalition with Labour is unlikely. 'The SNP is not going to Westminster to seek ministerial posts, we're going to Westminster to make Scotland's voice heard and to win more progressive policies for Scotland. 'Now, I've ruled out any kind of arrangement with the Tories, but I have also said to Labour, very directly, if there is an anti-Tory majority in the House of Commons, then even if the Tories are the biggest party, if Labour and the SNP work together we can stop a Tory government getting off the ground. 'I repeat that call to Ed Miliband today, and maybe today unlike the previous few days he will answer that. 'If we have an anti-Tory majority, will he work with the SNP rather than allow David Cameron back into Downing Street?' The Scottish First Minister was swamped with requests for selfies as she met residents of Livingston, west Lothian this morning . Ms Sturgeon has refused to work with the Conservatives under any circumstances, but has held out the possibility of putting Mr Miliband into power . The SNP is projected to win more than 40 seats in Scotland at the election, potentially leaving them holding the balance of power if Labour and the Tories both fall short . Ms Sturgeon was said to have triumped in last week's live TV debate, as polls suggest a surge in support for the SNP will cost Labour a majority on May 7 . She also outlined changes she said would support childcare and getting parents back to work, including uprating child tax credits and child benefit and a rise in the minimum wage to £8.70. Ms Sturgeon said she still wants Scotland to be independent, but in the meantime 'will push for the maximum devolution to Scotland'. 'If Scotland is to become independent, that will only happen with a vote in a referendum,' she said. 'But poll after poll shows that people in Scotland want significantly more powers in the Scottish Parliament. 'Now, I will not stop campaigning for and wanting Scotland to become independent, but that will only happen in a referendum.' Scottish Liberal Democrat president Sir Malcolm Bruce called on Ms Sturgeon to make clear whether she still supports the reversal of welfare changes made since 2010. He said: 'The SNP need to come clean. Are they planning to reverse welfare changes since 2010? 'This is what they have spent five years telling people. If so, where are they going to find the money that they have said would be £2.5 billion for Scotland alone? 'If they are not, people will expect them to admit that they are not going back to 2010. 'SNP voters will believe they've been led up the garden path. 'Only Liberal Democrats have set out costed and credible plans to balance the books by 2018, building a stronger economy and a fairer society. The SNP are all over the place when it comes to balancing the books.'
A new Kansas law tells poor families that they can't use cash assistance from the state to attend concerts, go swimming, visit theme parks or buy lingerie. The list of don'ts runs to several dozen items. More than 20 other states have such lists. But, the one included by the Republican-dominated Kansas Legislature in a bill that GOP Gov. Sam Brownback planned to sign Thursday appears to be the most exhaustive, according to state Department for Children and Families officials. The taxpayer-funded Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, currently provides cash payments of up to $497 per month for a family of four. To qualify that family must have an annual household income below $31,525 - before taxes - and assets valued at less than $2,000. Cutting back: In this April 13 photo, Kansas Republican Gov. Sam Brownback makes a point during an interview in his office in the Statehouse in Topeka, Kansas . The new restrictions, regarding Kansas applicants, have inspired national criticism and mockery from The Daily Show. Host Jon Stewart suggested that in accepting federal funds, Kansas should be forced to give up items like roads 'paved with luxurious asphalt.' 'The list has attracted attention because it feels mean-spirited,' said Shannon Cotsoradis, president and CEO of the advocacy group Kansas Action for Children. 'It really seems to make a statement about how we feel about the poor.' It is part of a broader welfare law taking effect in July that Brownback and his allies say is aimed at moving poor families from social services into jobs. In Kansas, here’s a list of what would be forbidden to those using cash assisted funds: . 'We want to get people off of public assistance and into private-sector employment, and we've had a lot of success with that,' Brownback during an interview this week with The Associated Press. A 2012 federal law requires states to prevent benefit-card use at liquor stores, gambling establishments or adult-entertainment businesses. At least 23 states have their own restrictions on how cards can be used, mostly for alcohol, tobacco, gambling and adult-oriented businesses, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. A few states - not Kansas - prohibit buying guns, according to the NCSL, and a few ban tattoos or body piercings. Massachusetts prohibits spending on jewelry, bail bonds, or 'vacation services.' A 2014 Louisiana law bars card use on cruise ships, which is also on the Kansas list. Kansas Department for Children and Families officials said that it's difficult to track how often cash assistance is used for items on the state's new list because recipients can use their benefits cards to obtain cash. The law will limit ATM withdrawals of cash assistance to $25 a day. The department said it reclaimed $199,000 in cash assistance from 81 fraud cases from July through February, but said most involved questions about eligibility. The state provided $14 million in cash assistance during the same period. A 2014 federal report said a check of eight states' data showed transactions with benefit cards at liquor stores, casinos or strip clubs accounted for less than 1 percent of the total. Critics question whether such restrictions can be enforced. Elizabeth Schott, senior fellow with the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said enacting them simply creates an 'aura of abuse.' 'Undermining support for the programs is what the restrictions do,' she said. Phyllis Gilmore, Kansas secretary for children and families, said her state's list is a 'composite' of others and has educational value, sending the message that cash assistance should be used for necessities. 'Every dollar that is used fraudulently is a dollar that is not going to an American who is struggling,' said state Sen. Michael O'Donnell, a Wichita Republican who supported the bill. Helping hand: The taxpayer-funded Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, currently provides cash payments of up to $497 per month for a family of four . Much of the new Kansas law codifies administrative policies enacted after Brownback took office in January 2011, so they'll be harder to undo later. They include a requirement that cash assistance recipients work at least 20 hours a week, be looking for work or enroll in job training. The new law also includes a much-criticized provision shortening the lifetime cap on cash assistance to 36 months from 48 months, although the state Department for Children and Families said recipients rarely bump up against the lower limit. The number of cash assistance recipients in Kansas has dropped 63per cent since Brownback took office, to about 14,700 in February. Brownback said the decline confirms the success of his policies, but critics note that U.S. Census Bureau figures show the state's child poverty rate remaining at about 19per cent through 2013. Brownback said his state's list of prohibited cash-assistance uses has become a way for the left to argue against welfare-to-work policies. 'I think you're seeing the left trying to pillory this,' Brownback said. 'They're just trying to poke fun at it, when it's not what the debate is really about.'
Rail firms came under fire this weekend for planning a series of fare hikes of up to 87 per cent just ten days after the general election - despite the main party leaders pledging to freeze prices. The Prime Minister has requested First Great Western (FGW) 'urgently review' its decision to almost double some fares on the route between London and the Cotswolds - which passes through his Witney constituency. Mr Cameron has promised to freeze fares in real terms for the whole of the next parliament, while Labour has also pledged to bring in a 'cap' on price hikes. Scroll down for video . Sent letter: Prime Minister David Cameron has written to First Great Western to request it 'urgently reviews' plans to increase fares on trains running through his Witney constituency . Passengers travelling from Charlbury, the Oxfordshire station nearest to his constituency home, can currently purchase an off-peak return to London costing £33.30. This allows them to leave at 9.42am, outside the morning peak, but return on one of the four services that go from London during the evening peak period. But from May 17, these customers will be forced to pay £62.40 if they want to come home on one of these trains - an 87 per cent increase. The planned changes have angered Mr Cameron's constituents - prompting him to personally intervene. 1. First Great Western . Line: London to Hereford . Potential increase: 87% . 2. Virgin . Line: Stafford to Liverpool . Potential increase: 24.5% . 3. London Midlands . Line: Crewe to Northampton . Potential increase: 23% . The Prime Minister's spokesman told The Sunday Times: 'Mr Cameron has written to First Great Western and asked them to urgently review their decision.' Train companies have three windows every year in which they can increase 'unregulated' fares, which make up around half of their total revenue. Unregulated fares can include journeys such as off-peak leisure and advance-purchase tickets. First Great Western has insisted the reason for the change is to bring the north Cotswolds route in line with its other services. The firm is also offering some customers a cheaper option in advanced single tickets, potentially allowing them to buy a return for £20 if they book ahead. Other sharp price hikes to be introduced include an off-peak first-class single from Crewe to Northampton on London Midlands, which will rise from £30 to £37, according to trainsplit.com - a website that provides passengers with cheaper ticket options. The cost of an anytime return between Stafford and Liverpool, travelling with Virgin, will leap from £26.50 to £33 - a 24.5 per cent hike. Biggest hike: Passengers travelling with the rail firm between London and the Cotswolds could face increases of up to 87 per cent come May 17 . And an anytime first-class day return on Virgin from Manchester to Stoke will go up 22 per cent - rising from £29 to £35.30. Virgin has said the 'vast majority' of its price hikes affected 'Virgin Trains-only fares' - which are at least 20 per cent cheaper than tickets offered by rival firms. It added: 'Our overall fare increase this year on the west coast is just 1.65 per cent, well below the industry average.' Speaking to Mark Hookham of The Sunday Times, Mike Richardson, of trainsplit.com, said: 'Passengers might very well be surprised at these fare increases when both the main parties have talked about price freeezes. According to Which? Hundreds of 'anytime' and 'off-peak' returns rose by 40 per cent in January. Its research found rail fare increases on tickets that passengers buy on the day and on rural routes. Defended rise: Virgin has said the 'vast majority' of its price hikes affected 'Virgin Trains-only fares' - which are at least 20 per cent cheaper than tickets offered by rival firms .
A mother was horrified to find a dead gecko stuck to the lining of a jacket she bought from Asda. Paula Dunican spent £25 on the baby blue coat at her local branch in Canterbury, Kent. But when the 49-year-old took it home to try on, she noticed a dark stain 'seeping through' from the its lining. Inside, a four inch-long gecko was flattened, its scales imprinted onto the fabric. Paula Dunican was horrified when she found the body of a crushed lizard on the lining of a £25 coat from Asda . 'I noticed the coat had a stain on the back seeping through, so I opened it and stuck to the lining was a shrivelled, squashed lizard,' said Mrs Dunican. 'I think it must have been ironed - it was disgusting.' The supermarket has offered her a refund and £40 voucher, adding that the reptile may have climbed into one of the boxes transporting clothes from Vietnam where they are made. Its quality control department said it was waiting for Mrs Dunican, who is a school learning support assistant, to return the garment. In 2012 another Asda customer found a dead cockroach inside a kettle she had bought to sterilise baby items. Mrs Dunican said the reptile looked as though it had been ironed onto the coat. A spokesman for Asda apologised and offered her a £40 voucher and refund . Carly Wintle bought the own brand appliance in Weston-Super-Mare, Somerset, and found the insect inside after unwrapping it. Meanwhile in February a disgusted shopper found the severed head of a frozen rat in a bag of frozen spinach. Terri Powis, 33, was horrified when she opened the bag and found the rodent's decomposing body. The supermarket apologised and asked her to return the item to the store, acting, she said, as though it happened 'every day', the Mirror reported.

Usain Bolt has revealed he wants to smash his own 200-metre world record by running the distance in under 19 seconds and insists he is almost impossible to beat when he is fully fit. The six-time Olympic gold medallist is currently in Rio de Janeiro, acclimatising ahead of next year's Olympic Games in the Brazilian capital, and will compete in the 'Mano a Mano' 100-metre challenge on Sunday. The Jamaican sprinter ran the 200 metres in 19.19 sec at the 2009 World Championships in Berlin and Bolt is confident he could shave two tenths off that time despite clocking a disappointing 20.20 sec at the UTECH Classic in his home country last Saturday.

'I definitely want to break the 200-metre record that is one of my biggest goals, it is actually to run under 19 seconds,' said Bolt. 'I think this season it will be hard to do, but I want to stay injury free this season so I can go into Olympic season in the best shape so it will be much easier to attempt the record. 'All I'm focusing on right now is just taking my time and getting through the season, getting my runs in, getting better over the season, getting to the World Championships (in Beijing later this year) and doing my best.' Bolt spent much of last-season nursing injuries while American rival Justin Gatlin dominated the sprint circuit setting times of 9.77 sec and 19.68 in the 100 and 200 metres respectively.

Gary Mabbutt has spoken for the first time about how he was left with a 30 inch scar following a five hour operation to save his leg. The ex-Tottenham and England star, 53, was rushed to hospital after waking up at 1am to find that the leg had gone cold back in 2013. Mabbutt's diabetes had led to a clogged artery in the limb and doctors warned him it was 'touch and go' on whether it would have to be amputated. Gary Mabbutt has been left with a 30inch scar on his left leg after his diabetes caused an artery to be clogged . He was treated at King's College Hospital in south east London, undergoing an emergency five-hour operation. Surgeons were required to replace the main artery in his left leg with a vein and needed 112 staples to seal the horrific wound. Mabbutt, who was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at 17, will not be able to play football again, leaving his dream of becoming a manager in tatters. As he is unable to train with players on the pitch, he has been forced to turn down roles in coaching. Surgeons were required to replace the main artery in his left leg with a vein and needed 112 staples to seal it . The Spurs legend has spoken for the first time about the agony he went through and says he hopes to raise awareness of his condition. Speaking to The Sun, he said: 'When they talked about battling to save my leg, I realised I was helpless. As a diabetic you know complications can occur. But you think "It's never going to happen to me". It is vital to educate everyone with diabetes how to take care of themselves. If you have anything unusual with your feet, tingly toes, blisters, see your doctor.' In 1982, father-of-two Mabbutt became the first diabetic ever to play for England and captained Tottenham to FA cup glory in 1991. Former star: Mabbutt is pictured, left, lifting the FA Cup while playing for Tottenham in  1991 . He was unaware that his diabetes had triggered peripheral arterial disease, clogging up the blood vessels in the legs. Every year, surgeons perform around 8,000 amputations on diabetics in the UK - but campaigners say four out five could be prevented. Amputations cost the NHS £650million a year - and up 80 per cent of the amputees die within five years. Diabates sufferers are entitled to annual eye tests as they are are 20 times more likely to develop sight problems, but Gary Mabbutt wants a similar programme to apply to feet. Experts say millions of diabetics are unaware their condition could lead to foot problems and agree regular checks could save limbs.
Just 13 and in the grip of a terrifying obsession surviving on just one piece of fruit a day, anorexic schoolgirl Laura Scurr's body started to shut down. The 15-year-old, from Whitley Bay, was left on a heart machine after she collapsed through starvation but has now spoken about pressures put on teenagers to be a 'size zero'. Laura became so obsessed with having the perfect figure she would hide food down the side of her bed, lying to her mother about eating and sometimes surviving on just a piece of fruit a day. Scroll down for video . Laura Scurr, 15, has spoken out about the pressures on young girls to be a size zero after, having becoming obsessed with her own weight, she developed anorexia . But her dramatic weight loss led to horrific consequences when she suddenly collapsed at her family home and was rushed to intensive care. Laura has spoken about her two-year fight with anorexia and revealed the pressures she felt to be thin. She said: 'At the worst point I was hiding food down the sides of the settee or beds, lying to my mum about having meals, and eating about 100 calories a day. 'I would even try to have mashed potato with each meal so I could hide the rest of the food under it, that way it looked like I'd ate more.' After spending a week on a heart monitor at North Tyneside General Hospital, Laura was finally offered support from eating disorder organisations as she began her recovery. Problems started for the teen two years ago when she decided she wanted to go on a diet. 'I was nearly 13 stone and felt like I was too big,' Laura said. 'I'd been bullied a little bit because of my weight, people saying things like 'here comes the whale' and that made me feel horrible. Laura was living off just one piece of fruit a day and would hide her food down the side of her bed so her parents wouldn't see it . Laura continued: 'I would look around at the other girls and they all seemed to be skinny and, of course, I wanted to be like them and fit into all the different types of clothes. 'But it wasn't just people I knew. I felt there was a lot of pressures from all over the place. Everywhere you looked there seemed to be this idea that girls should be a size zero.' Laura agreed with mum Sue, 48, to go on a 'sensible diet' but soon the Whitley Bay High School pupil became frustrated, wanting to lose more weight, quicker. According to the NHS Anorexia or Anorexia nervosa, to give its full name, is a serious mental health condition in which people try to keep their body weight as low as possible. It is often said that people will often restrict their intake of food, make themselves vomit or increase the amount of exercise they are doing. The condition often develops in people who are anxious about their body shape or weight, or in those who fear being fat or wish to be thin. Anorexia most commonly occurs in women, starting around the age of 16 or 17. Although there are cases of men suffering from the disease too. Often people suffering from anorexia will obsessively count calories, take laxatives and repeatedly weight themselves or check their bodies in the mirror. If you think you know someone who is suffering from the disease talk to them gently about it. Often it can be hard for them to seek help. You can also seek advice from an eating disorder charity such as Beat, who will be able to talk you through how to help them and how to handle the situation. In February 2015 it was estimated that around 725,000 people were suffering from an eating disorder in the UK - 10 per cent of those were suffering from anorexia. 'It was coming off quite slowly, at about 2lbs a week,' said Laura. 'But I became much more obsessive about it and decided to reduce my calorie intake. 'In the end, I was virtually eating nothing, maybe an apple or orange a day. 'I could tell my parents were getting worried, they couldn't understand why I didn't want to eat.' Lack of food soon took its toll on Laura's health and her heart rate started slowing. She said: 'I was in bed for three or four days, never going out of the house. 'I would feel dizzy or pass out because my heart rate was so slow.' Finally after a week of eating virtually nothing, Laura collapsed. No happy and healthy Laura has made it to the semi final of Miss Teen GB, the competition aims to stay away from size zero stereotypes . Sue, who works in sales, said: 'An ambulance was called and she was taken to hospital and put on the heart monitor for a week. Her body had just started to shut down. 'It was frightening, I was shocked that this was happening to my daughter. 'I remember sitting by her hospital bed and saying "Laura, do you realise how sick you are?" but she just said "I don't care, as long as I'm skinny". 'It was then I realised just how much pressure she, and all girls, were under to look a certain way.' After getting discharged Laura began working with eating disorder teams (EDICT) and Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) to help in her recovery. Today, her body image is better than ever and her new-found confidence has allowed her to make it through to the semi final of Miss Teen GB. The contest aims to promote 'positive and confidence-building experiences' for young girls, away from size zero stereotypes.
Floyd Mayweather Jnr recalls the reaction of his friends on the day he set himself up as an independent boxing business and told them: 'The time will come when I make a hundred million dollars in one night.' He says: 'They told me I was crazy.' That was when he broke away from Bob Arum, who is the promoter of the other combatant in the richest fight of all time. Manny Pacquiao will also earn more than $100million in Las Vegas on May 2. But Mayweather takes special pride in being his own boss as they break the boxing bank.

Mayweather boxing camp coordinator DeJuan Blake helps his cousin do neck exercises as he works out . As the master of his own destiny, the man who calls himself Money dictated when this mega-mega-fight between the two best boxers on the planet would happen. 'Five years too late,' cry the critics. 'It's all in the timing,' smiles Floyd. Five years ago they would have split $60m at most. Five years ago only the boxing fraternity would have been paying attention. Five years ago we would have pitched up at his gym when we liked. Now Mayweather will bank upwards of $180m, Pacquiao $120m. Now the whole wide world is waiting their collision with bated breath. On this frantic Tuesday, heavy security guarded the Mayweather Boxing Club for his media day. Cameras from more than 30 television stations, scores of journalists and his usual crew of friends and admirers await and eventually witness a nominal workout in that overcrowded, overheated room. Ironically, given that the human threat to his unbeaten record is from Manila, the location is in a mini-Chinatown. Does Floyd eat Filipino? There are Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese cafes... but no restaurants specialising in Philippines food. Cutman Rafael Garcia puts tape over the eyes and mouth of an image of Pacquiao on the wall .

Floyd Mayweather suspects Manny Pacquiao has a neurosis about being the smaller man, which leads him to wear lifts in the heel of his shoes when they stand face to face. Asked if he thought Pacquiao had been bothered by anything at their fight-launch stare-down, Mayweather said: 'He's been surprised to see me so much bigger and taller. And I know he wears little lifts in his shoes.' The tale of the tape measures Mayweather standing 5ft 8in, Pacquiao 5ft 6½ in. Mayweather arrived, somewhat on the late side, in his new, state-of-the-art, very expensive Mercedes Party Bus. He was preceded into the parking lot by his latest girlfriend driving an even costlier white Rolls Bentley coupe. The rest of the super-charged fleet stayed home in the mansion's garage. Floyd was followed to work by an LAPD police car. Only this time they were not chasing the man who has had his run-ins with the law. They were guarding one of the most important assets of the city of Las Vegas, which stands to profit by billions in big fight week. All in the timing. 'This thing just grows and grows,' says Mayweather. 'We now have one of the biggest fights ever in boxing history. And its not only about the money. 'One fight won't define my legacy. What about the 47 I've already won? 'It's an important fight. It wraps everything together – the money and my boxing. 'But if one fight defined everything this would be the only one I'd have needed.' And after this, he says, there will be only one more. Because it no longer amuses him like it did. 'I'm pretty much done with all this,' he tells a few of us summoned into a pocket in the middle of a crowd of people and cameras huge enough to do justice to a royal wedding. 'It's not fun like it was back then,' he explains. 'It's business now. I don't really enjoy it any longer.' He promises to fulfil the sixth and last fight of his mega-millions Showtime pay-per-view contract: 'Final one at the MGM Grand in September.'

Why always the MGM Grand Garden? He grins, shakes a right wrist wrapped in a glittering diamond and gold bracelet. It reminds him of the first time tickets for a fight of his there sold out inside six minutes and he happened to mention he had noticed a bejewelled watch in a shop window at one of the MGM hotels. 'They just went and got it as a gift for me,' he says. 'Ran to about $400,000.' He's come a long way from the drug-strewn, gangland streets of Grand Rapids, Michigan where he grew up in poverty. But much as those baubles are stamped with the hallmarks of his journey to wealth and fame, Mayweather knows it was a human quality which made it possible. 'Loyalty,' he says. 'Loyalty is the heartbeat of boxing. Whenever I need something the MGM get it for me. When I fight one of the biggest fights of all time, I take it to the MGM Grand Garden.' The clamour around him never stops but there have been heavily hyped events like this before which have turned into anti-climax for the public. Will this one be worth the money, at $10,000 for a ringside seat rising to more than $200,000 on the black market, at virtually $100 per pay-per-view buy here in America? It's all in the timing: 'Our names are way bigger than five years ago. You have the two best in the world fighting each other, at the pinnacle of their careers. And our styles should work. It'll be exciting.' Mayweather warms up by doing sit ups before he works out in front of the media . Having arrived late for his own workout, Mayweather worked up a sweat with his trainers . Mayweather laughs with David Hasselhoff, who was among the celebrities to attend the workout . American rapper Lil' Kim also stopped by the gym to watch Mayweather perform his workout . Hayley Roberts and Hasselhoff arrive at the gym in Las Vegas to see Mayweather put through his paces . Not that Mayweather is exactly jumping around in frenzied expectation: 'I'm not excited. This is another fight for me. Yeah it's big but basically it's no different from all the others. Once we get in that ring it's a level playing field. 'At my age (38) I'm over getting nervous about an opponent. I'm past getting wound up. What I have to do is get in that ring and be myself. Be the best Floyd Mayweather.' That, he is sure, will be enough to win. The fight sells itself. But he carries a quiet air of confidence. There is much speculation about Pacquiao storming his fabled defence but he says: 'We'll see. I know I can make adjustments to any fighter. Whatever he does, I can assess and make changes if I have to. 'I'm calm, smooth, calculated and thinking five steps ahead of any opponent. But can he adjust? He's a reckless fighter. We saw that when he got knocked out by (Juan Manuel) Marquez.' All in the timing? Mayweather is grateful that Pacquiao has survived long enough to play his part in what is fast approaching a half-billion dollar extravaganza. 'If I fought as reckless as Manny,' he says. 'I wouldn't be here today. I'd be beaten up, worn out. I've controlled my fights.' Mayweather works the heavy bag with just over two weeks to go before he steps into the ring with Pacquiao . Mayweather throws a right hook as he continues to show off his skills on the pads with his uncle . Mayweather throws an uppercut as dozens of cameras are trained on the superstar from the ring apron . Mayweather takes a break from his workout in the heat of his Las Vegas gym . Mayweather wipes away the sweat as he is put through his paces on a warm day in Sin City . Pacquiao has also fought more often so by that assessment it is fortunate for him, Mayweather and their bankers that he is two years the younger. Mayweather pauses and adds: 'If I hadn't made that decision to be my own boss I wouldn't be where I will be in the Grand Garden on May 2.' Wherever he goes in his adopted home town, be it a booming casino, a heaving night club or his favourite fast food joint Fatburger on the Vegas Strip, Mr Money brews up a storm. One created by the nature of the desert blows into the marquee in which we are talking. Chairs and tables fly. As most of the group run for cover Mayweather plays pretend scared, then strolls into his gym. It seems nothing frightens this man who arrived for work this day in a convoy of ludicrously expensive vehicles. Not a Nevada sand storm. Not Typhoon PacMan blowing in from the Philippines.
Finding a place where you can experience some all-important family time, outdoor fun and a helping of luxury at the same time might sound like a tall order... But if you're partial to a weekend under canvas, family-oriented festival Elderflower Fields might be one of the best tickets you can buy this year. As its founders explain, Elderflower Fields, held in the idyllic setting of Pippingford Park in the Ashdown Forest, is about giving children and families the chance to take part in a huge range of activities. Elderflower Fields Festival will be held in the idyllic setting of Pippingford Park for the second year running . The independent festival was created in 2012 by a small team of friends to provide the perfect environment for kids and grown-ups to fully escape for a weekend. Now entering its fourth year, Elderflower Fields builds upon the winning formula of a festival designed especially for families with children. It’s an exciting experience that opens children and their parents’ minds to new opportunities in sport, music, the arts, the environment and food, all set in the great outdoors. So says Nigel Greenwood, cofounder of So Sussex, the organisation responsible for creating the festival. "We’ve been overwhelmed by the positive comments and feedback received from festival goers over the last three years. Their words sum up the ethos of the festival far better than we ever could and inspire us to improve and make Elderflower Fields 2015 the best yet," he says. The Kalakuta Millionaires were a popular draw on the main stage last year . The view from the back: The Tones played in 2012 to an appreciative crowd . "What's really exciting for us is that the festival is becoming a moment of inspiration for children, their families and festival goers to try out new things." So what can festival goers expect in 2015? "Elderflower Fields prides itself on booking the best up and coming new bands and performers and providing opportunities for young people to engage in and be inspired by music," says Greenwood. The diverse range of artists already confirmed for Elderflower Fields 2015 includes Danny and the Champions Of The World, Patch and The Giant, The Kings Parade, and Mr B The Gentleman Rhymer. Spa in the woods anyone? The chance to sip champagne in a hot tub proved rather popular in 2014... thanks to Bathing Under the Sky . Children go free! The idyllic surrounds of the Ashdown Forest made for one giant playground . Other performance experiences include a storytelling area in the woods, theatre and dance classes, magic and movement workshops, plus a good old fashioned family rave from the brilliant Big Fish Little Fish party people. This year will see the festival partner with East Sussex Music Services for the first time to provide a range of introductory music opportunities for children. This includes instrument try outs, composing workshops, songwriting workshops and a BBC Ten Pieces performance developed with schools before the festival which will then see kids learning the piece during the festival itself. Richard Navarro and other musicians will be taking time from performing to run masterclasses in the Youth Music area. Sea of green: Campers walk down through the fields to the nearby festival areas, with more activities for children going on in the woods than you can shake a stick at . Everybody say hey! The Sports camps run by Premier Sports were a huge hit with children (and parents...) Premier Sport will be running this years sports camp giving children the chance to try diverse sports such as dodgeball, lacrosse and tri-golf. Organisers say they will also be running an orienteering course and a Disc Golf course with Sussex Disc Golf. "We also have SKiL coming to provide drop in activity sessions including stickball and adventure runs, and in this the year of the Rugby World Cup we have the coaches of Lewes Rugby Club running two beach rugby sessions," says Greenwood. Meanwhile the Urban Woods welcomes back climbing, parkour, slacklining and our skateboard half pipe, plus Adventure Unlimited have been called in to provide kayaking, raft building and high ropes. Anything else? Well yes. The So Sussex Sunday picnic has become something of a trademark and is one of the highlights of the weekend. The perfect way to spend an afternoon with friends and family (or even strangers) - it's all included in the ticket. Could Elderflower Fields be the only festival in the world to supply every guest with a free shared picnic filled with delicious tasters of local produce? Yes. And don't mention the legendary chocolate cake... Elderflower Fields has more free activities on offer per child that any other festival, the organisers claim. All sessions are run by a dedicated team of professional organisations providing kids with the opportunity to discover new skills and have fun. Rafting, mud hut building, music masterclasses, parkour, science, disc golf, night walks, slack-lining, bush craft skills, art workshops, sports camp, kayaking, orienteering, pond dipping, drama workshops, climbing wall and more are all included in the price of the ticket. The Green People Woodland Spa is already taking bookings for luxurious festival pampering. It's possible to prebook supervised sports or arts camp sessions via the website so that the kids are taken care of while parents relax. The Double Decker Hot Tub Bus is back as well. As for the music lineup, think Gypsy, folk, blues, rock, cajun, swing, dance and classical. "We're super excited about the line up this year and think we have something for everyone. We also welcome a unique performance being curated on site by East Sussex Music Service as part of the BBC Ten Pieces, as well as the winners of our Youth Music Competition," says Greenwood. 5: Food and Drink: We have some of the finest local food providers at Elderflower Fields this year. Some regular favourites and a few new surprises to enjoy. All supplying affordable high quality meals. We've worked hard with suppliers to ensure all diets are catered for - especially the kids. The cocktail bar will be back with a new stage and late music for the night owls and two further bars will be serving up craft beers, local ales, ciders and more... As the organisers are parents themselves they must know the value of having time to relax and unwind... Happy families from the last three years can vouch for that. Some of the reviews of Elderflower Fields include these rather positive vibes: . "The festival was populated by happy families replete with festival cheer and zillions of small children enjoying their free-range festie-freedom. Pippingford Park is an amazing venue surrounded by some of the most beautiful nature in the south of England, well away from the hustle and bustle of daily life." Could this be paradise found for families?

One of Argentina's top referees is under investigation and faces a possible ban after overturning a red card and penalty decision based on a television replay. Referee German Delfino awarded a penalty to Velez Sarsfield after  Daniel Valencia was adjudged to have handled the ball in the area and showed the Arsenal man his second booking of the game. However, the decision was overturned after linesman Ivan Nunez caught a replay of the incident on a nearby cameraman's monitor and informed Delfino via his earpiece. One of Argentina's top referees faces a ban after overturning a decision based on a television replay . Arsenal's Daniel Valencia is dismissed by German Delfino after appearing to handle the ball in the area . Linesman Ivan Nunez caught a replay of the incident on a nearby cameraman's monitor and informed Delfino . Delfino overturned the decision  - to the annoyance of Velez who lost out on a penalty and a man advantage . Despite  the correct decision being awarded by the referee - replays showed  striker Mariano Pavone was the handball offender and the frontman was subsequently booked - Velez were left fuming after the penalty was overturned and Valencia was allowed to return to the field. Video technology is not allowed in Argentine football and, after a melee ensued on the pitch involving players and coaching staff, Velez manager Miguel Angel Russo said: 'Delfino has every right to change his decision. But by his own decision, not off the television. 'The Fifa rules are very clear, they don't accept technology... If cameras are to exist then let them be used for everyone.' Velez captain Fabian Cubero gave an on-pitch interview during the game and said: 'You can't change it. What are the rules?' Arsenal's Valencia was allowed to return to the field while Velez striker Mariano Pavone was shown a yellow . Velez players and coaching staff protest at referee Delfino after his decision to overturn the decision . Velez manager Miguel Angel Russo said: 'Delfino has every right to change his decision. But by his own decision, not off the television' Velez captain Fabian Cubero gave an on-pitch interview and said: 'You can't change it. What are the rules?' Meanwhile, referee Delfino accepted the decision was sloppy and admitted: 'The procedure was horrible. It can't happen like this. 'You've got to be strong. I changed the decision because of my colleague, we are a team. 'If it was handball by Pavone then I'm happy that there was justice... but it was sloppy and I'm responsible.' After his initial reprieve, Arsenal's Valencia picked up another booking and was dismissed deep into injury time as Velez went on to claim a 2-1 victory.
The founder of Bikram yoga, who has been accused of sexually assaulting multiple students, has said women love him so much he wouldn't need to rape them to get sex. Speaking out for the first time since six women filed civil lawsuits accusing him of unwanted sexual advances, 69-year-old Bikram Choudhury strongly denied the accusations. 'I never assaulted them,' he said as he spoke to CNN. 'The answer is I feel sorry for them... They're entranced by somebody - lawyers.' Choudhury, who pioneered the practice of working out in a room heated to 105F, has his name attached to 720 yoga schools in 220 countries. Chelsea Clinton, Madonna and Demi Moore are among his followers. Scroll down for video . Denial: Bikram Choudhury, who has been accused of sexual advances by six separate women, has denied the allegations in an interview with CNN - the first time he has spoken out about the accusations . Choudhury told CNN that his success means he would never need to assault anyone. 'Women likes me. Women loves me,' he said. 'So if I really wanted to involve the women, I don't have to assault the women.' When asked how his wife of more than 30 years, fellow yoga instructor Rajashree Choudhury, had responded to the accusations, Choudhury became emotional. 'My wife never look at me anymore,' he said. 'Twenty-four hours a day, I work harder than any human being in this Earth... and this is my reward? I'm a rapist? Shame [on] your Western culture.' 'Targeted': Sarah Baughn, pictured speaking to CNN, said Choudhury told her they should be together and that she needed to have sex with him if she wanted to advance her career. She no longer practises . At work: He pioneered Bikram yoga, in which followers practice 26 yoga moves in temperatures of 105F . Bikram yoga,  devised by Bikram Choudhury, is based on regular hatha yoga, but performed in 105F temperatures for 90 minutes. Fans claim that it not only leaves them stronger and more flexible than standard yoga, it also helps them shed weight quickly. Choudhury began practising yoga in Calcutta at the age of three, spending up to six hours a day perfecting his poses. At 13 he won the National India Yoga Championship and went on to devise the 26 'asanas' (poses) and two breathing methods that form the core of Bikram yoga. He claims to have been invited to the U.S. in 1973 by President Richard Nixon to help him improve his health through yoga. After moving to Los Angeles, he started teaching Shirley MacLaine, whom he credits with spreading his name. He also claims to have taught yoga to Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton and has a legion of celebrity fans . including Lady Gaga, Madonna, Jennifer Aniston and tennis champion Andy . Murray. Choudhury says Bikram works because the  heat loosens the muscles, helping them to go further than they would otherwise. Since 2013, six women have stepped forward to accuse him of unwanted sexual advances, and studios have started to drop his name, signalling that his empire is crumbling. Sarah Baughn, one of his accusers, told CNN that Bikram yoga was 'life changing' and as soon as she took part, she knew she wanted to teach the practice. But when she joined Bikram's teacher training course in the mid-2000s, he quickly targeted her, she claimed. 'I was asked by him to come into his office and he sat down,' she said. 'And immediately went into, "What should we do about this? What should we do about us? We need a relationship".' She was shocked - 'I felt like my whole system just sort of imploded' - and was advised by another staff member to avoid being alone with him. But on another night, he cornered her after the group watched a movie together, she said. 'He crawled on top of me,' she said. 'He put his hand on the inside of my thigh and the other hand he wrapped around me, and he was holding me there.' He told her that he needed someone to massage him, brush his hair and have sex with him, she said - and made it clear that she would only advance in her career if she slept with him. 'Struggle': He said his wife, Rajashree Choudhury, no longer looks at him because of the accusations . Emotional: When asked about his wife's reaction, Choudhury became emotional and questioned why he was being accused of sexual assaults after working so hard. 'Shame on your Western culture,' he said . 'I looked him in the eyes and pushed him off of me and I said, "I can do this by myself",' she said. 'And he said, "No you can't, there's no way". I got up and I left the room.' Baughn has previously likened the atmosphere in the Bikram community to a cult and said she had endured Choudhury's sexual assaults as just something that went with the territory. Others told her to separate the man from the teacher, she said. Baughn's lawsuit is scheduled for trial in August. She no longer practices yoga. Most recently, a Canadian woman, Jill Lawler, filed a civil case against him on February 13, alleging that he raped her during a nine-week class when she was just 18. In her suit, Lawler said she went into the class elated to learn from the master, but things quickly soured as she was expected to massage him while watching Bollywood movies late into the night. As they watched the films, he groped her, she said. He apologized but weeks later, he asked Lawler to come to his hotel room where he sexually assaulted her, it is claimed. Accusers: Larissa Anderson, left, and Jill Lawler, right, have both filed civil lawsuits against Choudhury . 'Throughout the sexual abuse, defendant Bikram Choudhury offered multiple explanations and justifications for his behavior,' her lawsuit said. 'He would say "I'm dying, I need to you to save me. If I don't have sex I will die. You are saving my life, you are helping me".' The lawsuit states that Lawler continued doing Bikram yoga for years and that Choudhury's abuse continued on multiple occasions, the most recent being in February 2013. At the time, Choudhury's lawyers  and his Yoga College of India said he never sexually assaulted any of the women and that prosecutors declined to bring charges. The Los Angeles district attorney declined to bring charges in a case against Choudhury in 2013 for lack of evidence, spokesman Ricardo Santiago said. See below for video .
Disgraced former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell made his final written plea to a federal appeals court Wednesday, arguing that the favors he did for a wealthy businessman were routine courtesies and not part of a bribery scheme. The onetime rising Republican star made the argument in a 54-page brief in the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. A three-judge panel of the court will conduct a hearing on his appeal of his public corruption convictions on May 12. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell fought back tears outside a federal court building after he was sentenced for selling the influence of his office to the CEO of a dietary supplements company . McDonnell was sentenced to two years in federal prison for public corruption . McDonnell and his wife, Maureen, were convicted in a joint trial in September of accepting more than $165,000 in gifts and loans from former Star Scientific Inc. CEO Jonnie Williams in exchange for promoting his company's nutritional supplements. Bob McDonnell was sentenced to two years in prison and his wife to one year and one day, but they remain free while they pursue separate appeals. 'Governor McDonnell never promised anything and never did anything besides extend to Williams the sorts of routine courtesies elected officials throughout the country extend to donors and benefactors every day,' McDonnell's lawyers wrote in the latest filing. They were responding to the government's brief urging the court to uphold the criminal convictions. Former first lady Maureen McDonnell, left, was sentenced to a year and a day . Star Scientific CEO Jonnie Williams testified under an immunity deal, admitting that he paid the governor with lavish perks in exchange for helping him secure university backing for his 'miracle cure' Anatabloc product . Prosecutors had written in a 93-page submission to the court that McDonnell's actions fit the definition of 'official acts' even better than those taken by former Louisiana Rep. William Jefferson, who is serving 13 years in prison for taking bribes in exchange for using his influence to broker business deals with government leaders in Africa. Jefferson was famously caught with $100,000 in bribe money hidden in his freezer. 'Here, defendant directed his action toward subordinate state employees within the branch of government that he controlled as governor,' they wrote, while in the Jefferson case 'a congressman took action through meetings, letters, and the like directed at other government agencies or foreign governments.' One of McDonnell's chief claims on appeal is that the favors he did for Williams did not amount to 'official acts' covered by federal bribery law. In the new filing, he argues that a meeting McDonnell arranged for Williams with an administration official was 'innocuous' and that there was nothing special about an event at the Executive Mansion to launch Star's signature product, the anti-inflammatory Anatabloc. 'Governor McDonnell arrived late, made neutral comments, and left. He never asked anyone to do anything for Williams,' the brief says. Star Scientific, the maker of Anatabloc, the anti-inflammatory supplement at the center of the McDonnell trial, halted sales of the product in August 2014 . Worse than the freezer bribes? Prosecutors argue McDonnell's behavior was a better fit with bribery laws than that of convicted former congressman William Jefferson, who his $100,000 of his bribe cash in his freezer . McDonnell argues that in addition to mischaracterizing such events as 'official acts,' the government incorrectly suggested that McDonnell kept his staff in the dark about most of Williams' gifts. Among the gifts were almost $20,000 worth of designer clothing and accessories for Maureen McDonnell, vacations, golf outings and $15,000 for a daughter's wedding. The former governor also renewed claims that the judge improperly denied separate trials for Bob and Maureen McDonnell and that he failed to adequately question jurors about pretrial news coverage. Williams, who was seeking state-financed research on Anatabloc while lavishing the McDonnells with gifts and loans, testified under immunity for the prosecution.

This is the terrifying moment an SUV hurtled head-on into a school bus full of students on Monday morning. Footage taken from the bus's windscreen dash-cam captures the screams of 36 7th graders on board as a Dodge Durango swerves erratically in their direction at 60 mph. It crashes into an SUV on the right side of the road then ricochets across the center median. The clip, obtained by News On 6, ends abruptly as the two vehicles collide. Horrifying: The red Dodge Durango can be seen hurtling at 60 mph towards the school bus on an Oklahoma highway at 8.20am as 36 7th grade students are being driven to school . Screams: The children on board shriek with fear as the driver is powerless to move out of the car's way . Crash: The impact sends smoke pouring into the air and crushes the SUV . Five of the 36 pupils were hospitalized with minor injuries and 11 were treated at the scene at 8.20am in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on Monday. The 44-year-old driver of the SUV, who allegedly has a history of seizures, was driving approximately 20 mph over the speed limit. He was trapped inside his car for 20 minutes after the crash until firefighters were able to cut him from the wreckage, News On 6 reported. The driver of the SUV, a 44-year-old man with a history of seizures, had to be cut out of the wreckage . Police commended the bus driver for doing what she could. They are investigating whether the SUV driver had a seizure before or during the crash in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on Monday at 8.20am . He is recovering in a serious condition in hospital as police work to determine whether his medical history was a factor in the crash. Police commended the bus driver for 'doing what she could' by noticing the SUV and stopping the bus. She then checked every student on board was safe. Tulsa Public Schools spokesman Chris Payne said parents of the pupils, from McClain Junior High School and McClain's 7th Grade Academy, were notified immediately. Police have refused local media requests to release a second video which shows the pupils reacting to the crash, on the grounds that it is traumatic and the passengers are all minors.
If you think you have seen a ghost, you may have been suffering the effects of exposure to mould, according to a group of scientists. Researchers claim that older buildings where hauntings are usually reported, often have poor air quality from pollutants like toxic mould, which can affect our brains. Exposure to the mould can cause mood swings, irrational anger and cognitive impairment. All an illusion? Researchers claim that older buildings where hauntings (illustrated by a stock image) are usually reported, often have poor air quality from pollutants like toxic mould, which can affect our brains . ‘Experiences reported in many hauntings are similar to mental or neurological symptoms reported by individuals exposed to toxic moulds,’ said Professor Shane Rogers of Clarkson University in Potsdam, New York. ‘Psychoactive effects of some fungi are well-known, whereas the effects of others such as indoor moulds are less researched. ‘Although allergy and asthma symptoms and other physiological effects are well established, there has long been controversy over the effects of indoor mould exposure on cognitive and other functioning of the brain. ‘Reports of psychiatric symptoms including mood swings, hyperactivity, and irrational anger, as well as cognitive impairment are prevalent among those exposed to moulds. Brain drain: Exposure to the mould can cause mood swings, irrational anger and cognitive impairment, among other problems. A stock image of toxic mould in the firm of Stachybotrys chartarum spores, is shown . 'Ghosts' tend to be sighted in old buildings, which are often more likely to have damp and mould problems. No-one is exactly sure of the psychoactive effects of indoor moulds on the brain. But spores have been linked with mood swings, hyperactivity, and irrational anger, as well as cognitive impairment. Recent reports indicate that exposure to toxic mould spores may cause brain inflammation and memory loss. A team of researchers are exploring whether the mould may cause people to think they have seen ghosts, by comparing conditions in 'haunted' and non-haunted old buildings. ‘Other reports include depression and loss of memory function. ‘More recent work is emerging that supports brain inflammation and memory loss in mice exposed to Stachybotrys charatarum, a common indoor air mould, as well as increased anxiety and fear.’ Professor Rogers is currently leading a team of researchers measuring air quality in several reportedly haunted places around New York State. The group will compare samples taken from several buildings where ghost sightings have been reported with samples taken from properties with no paranormal activity, to see if there is a difference in the types of fungi. Professor Rogers said: ‘I have long been a fan of ghost stories and shows related to investigation of haunted places and have to admit to some strange occurrences in my own past. ‘Many of the places under investigation and from my own experiences may be prime environments for mould and other indoor air quality issues. ‘We would like to see if we can parse out some commonality between the mould microbiome in places that are haunted relative to those that are not.’ The real ghost busters: Here, undergraduate environmental engineering students (from left to right) Thomas O'Rourke and Daniel C. Schwab work with Professor Shane Rogers to sample air quality in buildings associated with alleged ghost activity . The team have only just begun their investigations, but have been to a handful of ‘haunted’ buildings to collect samples, as well as properties with mould, but no connection to ghosts. ‘In one historic house turned into an office building there have been reports of noises, moving ceiling tiles, moving items on shelves and desks, apparitions, and a general feeling of unease among building occupants,’ he said. ‘There have been long-standing stories of some of the original family members still occupying the place. ‘In another location, the Remington Art Museum in Ogdensburg New York, there is a long history of ghost stories involving the former occupants and others. ‘A week prior to our visit, they had a visit from a psychic who took a reading in several rooms in the museum that we then used to target our air quality studies. ‘She reported a few “folks” came to speak with her, children running in and out of some of the rooms in the house, and a woman that claimed she was "not won in a poker game”, which was related to a long-time story related to the Remington family. ‘So far, we haven’t been spooked out of a location, but time will tell.’ The team have only just begun their investigations, but have been to a handful of ‘haunted’ buildings to collect samples, as well as properties with mould, but no connection to ghosts. For example, they have visited the Remington Art Museum in Ogdensburg New York (pictured), where there is a long history of ghost stories .
With 17 feature films, two fashion campaigns and a role as a UN Ambassador under her belt, it's hard to believe that Emma Watson is just 25. The Harry Potter star reached a quarter of a century yesterday, celebrating what must arguably be one of the recognisable A-lister names on the planet. Now renowned for her effortless style and influential role in women's right movements, Emma has come a long way from her frizzy-haired days as Harry Potter's loyal companion. Scroll down for video . Emma Watson turns 25 and has already carved a career that many of us can only dream of . But how has the actress made the transition from Hermione Granger to a feminist heroine? Here, FEMAIL charts her 14 years in the spotlight that have made her a global icon. 2001 . Emma was placed firmly in the global spotlight after taking on one of the world's most famous roles. Aged just 11, she joined the cast of Harry Potter And The Philosopher's Stone as the geeky but loyal Hermione Granger. Alongside Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint, she was catapulted to fame after the adaption of the JK Rowling book grossed at $317m (£214m) worldwide. Emma's career began when she landed the roll of Hermione Granger alongside Daniel Radcliffe (centre) and Rupert Grint (right) who play Daniel Radcliffe and Ron Weasley in the Harry Potter saga . Emma was just 11 when she filmed Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. She is pictured here bright-eyed at her first ever premier for the first film . 2002 . A year later saw the release of the second film in the series - Harry Potter And The Chamber Of Secrets which saw Harry Potter and Ron Weasley go it alone after Emma's character Hermione is petrified by a giant snake known as the Basilisk. Critics criticised the director Chris Columbus for under-employing Emma's talents in the film. After her appearance in the second Harry Potter flick critics criticised the director for underplaying Emma . 2004 . In the third installment of the Harry Potter series, Hermione took a more prominent role, aiding Harry in restoring peace in Hogwarts, travelling back in time. The actress earned kudos for her powerful female role after she famously punched the gang's arch Nemesis Draco Malfoy, which the actor Tom Felton described as 'hardcore'. The film also sees her famous frizz take some taming, as her hair appears softer and more tamed. 2005 . As Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire was released, Emma was recognised as an individual. She received a Bronze Otto Award for her performance and, after her Yule Ball costume sent many teenage boys' hearts a flutter, she landed a cover on Teen Vogue magazine. Hermione takes a much bigger role in Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban . Emma won over the hearts of many teenage boys when she was transformed from a girl to a woman at the Yule Ball in Harry Potter And Yhe Goblet Of Fire . Emma may be an on-screen siren however she was still finding her fashion feet in 2005 . 2007 . In the fifth film - Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix - we also begin to get a sense of her worth, with her earnings so far estimated to be £10m. This year also sees Emma branch out from her role as Hermione, taking the lead in the BBC production of Ballet Shoes based on the novel by Noel Streatfeild, which was aired over Christmas. It was also this year Emma considered leaving the Harry Potter franchise. When she was asked to renew her contract that she had been presented with at the tender age of nine, she wanted to give it serious thought after she said her life had become out of her control. 'I get told what time I can eat, when I have time to go to the bathroom. Every single second of my day is not in my power,' she said at the time. Eventually at the age of 16, she signed up for another five years with Warner Brothers. Emma's hair took a bleach blonde tone in 2007 following her appearance in the fifth Potter film . The BBC adaptation of Ballet Shoes was the first non-Potter role for Emma Watson aged 16 . 2008 . It was a role in which we heard Emma, but didn't see her as the actress voiced the role of Princess Pea in the animated film The Tale Of Desperaux.

A couple who chose to forsake their dream wedding in order to pay for one final shot at IVF are celebrating giving birth to twins and even found a way to say their 'I do's' Becca Litchfield, 29, and partner Dale, 30, from Gotham, Nottingham, were heart-broken when they discovered their savings would only be enough to cover the cost of a wedding, or fertility treatment. Desperate for a family, the couple chose to sacrifice their dream wedding and go ahead with IVF, but were over the moon when weeks later they became winners of a wedding competition. Becca and Dale Litchfield decided to give up their dream wedding in order to have one last shot at IVF and have since welcomed twins,  Darci-Mai (left) and  Stanley (right) The happy couple said their vows, and were overjoyed when they discovered the fertility treatment had worked - and Becca gave birth to twins Stanley and Darci-Mai. The full-time mother says that the couple can't believe their luck having achieved both of their dreams. 'When we realised we'd couldn't have children and get married, it was heart breaking,' she said. 'It was devastating to give up one of our dreams. We knew that we weren't getting any younger so the best option was to try IVF one last time, and sacrifice the wedding. 'It was a risk, because the IVF could have failed - and we'd have ended up with neither. 'But when we won the wedding competition, and then found out I was pregnant, it was unbelievable. Although they had given up on the idea of their perfect wedding the couple were blessed with yet another stroke of luck when they won a wedding contest which allowed them to finally get married . Before they conceived Darci-Mai (right) and Stanley (left) Becca and Dale had attempted two rounds of IVF . 'Now I've got my dream - the perfect husband and children, I couldn't be happier.' Becca and Dale, first started IVF treatment in 2012 after a year of failing to conceive naturally. The couple spent £5,500 on two rounds of IVF, keeping back an additional sum of money that they planned to spend on their wedding day. But after two failed attempts, Becca and Dale were forced to make a decision, Becca says that it was an incredibly difficult one to make. 'We were spending all of our money on IVF treatment hoping we'd conceive but after we failed twice I wondered if I'd ever get pregnant,' she said. 'We planned to use the spare money to get married but knew because of our ages we'd have to have kids now or never. 'I'd always dreamt of feeling my baby kick for the first time and the bond after giving birth, so I knew we had to try IVF one last time.' After winning the wedding competition the couple were able to have the white wedding they had always wanted . Becca, pictured with Darci-Mai (left) and Stanley (right) In order to conceive, Becca, pictured with Darci-Mai, had to take three hormone injections a day but she says it was entirely worth it . After abandoning hopes of a big celebration the couple decided to at least secure their relationship with a proposal. 'We were advised to wait for a year before trying again - I was just counting down the days,' she said. 'It felt like time was ticking away so quickly. At the end of the year, Dale and I officially became engaged - it was a way to lift our spirits and we thought if we couldn't have a big wedding, we could at least get engaged.' But unbeknownst to Becca, during their year long wait for IVF, Dale, who works as an electrician, entered the pair into a win a wedding competition. Becca says that once again fate was in their favour having initially been runners-up. Becca says that she and Dale couldn't stop beaming when they discovered they were expecting twins . 'We actually came second in the competition, but then the first place dropped out and so we won,' she said. 'We couldn't believe it - after all the heart ache and the decision making, we were getting both. 'It felt like a miracle. I'd always dreamt of a big white wedding and walking down the aisle, but I'd put that to the back of my mind. 'I couldn't believe my dreams were going to become a reality.' After the wedding, the pair changed fertility clinics and had their final round of IVF. It was here that medics discovered Becca had low hormone levels and started to treat her for the problem, giving her three hormone injections a day to increase the chance of her falling pregnant . When Becca first discovered she was pregnant she was so shocked she took four tests to make sure. She gave birth to twins Darci-Mai (left) and Stanley (right) Becca says that it was a challenging period but she was prepared to carry on in hope of having her dream family. 'I felt like a pin cushion while I was having all the treatment but knew it was worth it. 'Then after the eggs were implanted I took two weeks off work to relax and do nothing other than sit with my legs up in the hope it would help us to get pregnant. 'Then we did a pregnancy test and it was positive. We didn't want to get our hopes up but after four more tests said we were pregnant I believed it.' Overjoyed with the news Becca was then astounded to find out that she was not carrying just one baby but two. 'Once I knew I was pregnant I had a feeling we were going to have twins and when doctors confirmed it we couldn't believe it. 'When the doctor told me there were two heartbeats we were all gobsmacked. The twins were born on 27th September last year . Becca says that even when the Darci-Mai (left) and Stanley (right) are screaming she feels lucky to have them . 'Me and Dale sat beaming at each other, we couldn't believe we were about to have one baby let alone twins.' The twins were born in September last year and six months later the couple still can't quite believe their luck. Becca said: 'It's amazing to think how dramatically our life changed in one year - we got married and now have a beautiful boy and girl. 'Even now I still feel so privileged to have children - even when they are screaming I keep thinking thank goodness that they are with us. 'Before I thought of myself as very unlucky, I'd never won anything in my life. 'But since winning our wedding and having kids it still doesn't feel real. 'I've definitely used my life's worth of luck now but I don't care because I've got everything I ever dreamed of so I'm happy. 'Finally everything's gone right, we are finally married parents after everything we've been through it is incredible.'

Jailed: Jordan Sim-Mutch posted pictures of stolen money and drugs on Facebook after targeting businesses across Greater Manchester . A 24-year-old man who carried out a series of raids on petrol stations and convenience stores has been jailed after boasting about his crimes on Facebook. Jordan Sim-Mutch posted pictures of stolen money and drugs on the social networking site after targeting businesses across Greater Manchester. The career criminal, who claimed he worked in 'midnight removals' in his online profile, was part of an armed gang responsible for 29 robberies and burglaries. Sim-Mutch, from Stockport, Greater Manchester, was jailed yesterday after admitting to a string of offences at Minsull Street Crown Court. On Wednesday night, hours before he was sentenced, Sim-Mutch uploaded a picture taken inside the courtroom that shows he and his fellow gang members in the dock. The photograph of the smirking men - which is now being used as the criminal's 'cover picture' on Facebook - was illegally taken by a friend in the public gallery. A number of supportive comments have since been left on the image, with one saying 'love you Jord' and another posting 'lads on tour'. The court was told the gang carried out a series of armed raids on petrol stations, convenience stores and a pub to pay for cannabis. The men used a number of stolen cars fitted with false licence plates, including a BMW and an Audi A5, to use as getaway vehicles, it was heard. They targeted businesses in groups of four, armed with a variety of weapons including bricks, baseball bats, a meat cleaver, axes, and, on one occasion, an imitation firearm. Three men would enter the premises and hold up staff as the fourth remained in the car. Prosecutor Adam Smith told the court that on one occasion, the men stole nearly £4,000 worth of cigarettes and £1,000 in cash from a BP garage in Bredbury. In another robbery, three of the group walked into a pub and threatened customers with a meat cleaver. Mr Smith said: 'A customer was threatened and told to "get in the back" towards the rear cash office where there was a safe. 'One was threatened with the cleaver and two took the member of staff to the office where they were forced to open the safe before they took £2,000.' The gang were involved in 29 robberies and burglaries across areas of Stockport and Greater Manchester. The men were first caught in November 2013, but were granted bail by the courts. When they re-started the operation in February last year, the gang had to carry out their crimes during the day because they were subject to curfews and electronic tagging orders. The gang were caught after police, suspecting they were behind a spree of recent robberies, started to monitor them. Sim-Mutch pleaded guilty to conspiracy to rob, conspiracy to commit burglary, conspiracy to steal and conspiracy to possess an imitation firearm.

Above, Jordan Sim-Mutch in photos posted online . Mitigating, his barrister Simon Morton said he was not a member who ordered victims to the floor because he suffers with a stammer. Explaining why he got involved in the enterprise, Sim-Mitch told him: 'Well I'm just a big daft lad, aren't I?' Mr Morton said: 'He goes on to say there is no excuse for what he did. This is a big mistake, a long time in jail for a poxy bit of money.' Sentencing Judge Timothy Mort said: 'These are premises in the local community - local to you - where people are providing a valuable service for you and your neighbours and friends and family. They targeted businesses in groups of four, armed with a variety of weapons including bricks, baseball bats, a meat cleaver, axes, and, on one occasion, an imitation firearm. Above, a photograph posted by Sim-Mutch . Sim-Mutch, pictured, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to rob, conspiracy to commit burglary, conspiracy to steal and conspiracy to possess an imitation firearm. He was jailed for nine and a half years yesterday . 'Normal people who go to the pub and go to the shop. They are providing a valuable service in your community and it is your community you have been targeting. 'When one analyses conspiracies it is straight forward enough. Worryingly simple offences are being committed. 'If it was a vulnerable convenience store, three would go in, get cigarettes, the till, wave something at staff and run for it. Easy money. 'Mr Sim-Mutch, he would get a call saying "do you want to take part?" There were more than enough happy to do it if you didn't want to take part.' Getaway driver Paul Edwards, 34, who had offences or robbery stretching back to 2001, was jailed for nine-and-a-half years. Tyler Quinn, 22, was jailed for eight-and-a-half years. Aaron Bell, 18, was jailed for seven years. Ben Fredricks, 23, was jailed for nine-and-a-half years. Paul Huskie, 23, who stored the 'robbers' kit' in his flat, was jailed for three years. The gang, all from Stockport, admitted conspiracy to rob.
The crew of a Turkish airlines flight are being investigated after they allowed Turkish football team captain Arda Turan into the cockpit so he could use the tannoy to congratulate his team-mates. He was celebrating after the team's 2-1 international friendly victory against Luxembourg and had gone to the cockpit to announce his congratulations over the PA system last week. But after the move was reported in Turkish media, Turkish aviation officials in the country's Civilian Aviation Directorate (SHGM) said it was a serious breach of the safety rules of the flight back from the capital Luxembourg City and warned that there would be consequences for the cabin crew. Turkish skipper Arda Turan is pictured inside the plane's cockpit during the flight in breach of aviation rules after his side's 2-1 victory in an international friendly against Luxembourg . They said that nobody other than the crew should be allowed in the cockpit during the flight and exception should be made for nobody, even the Turkish team captain and Atletico Madrid midfielder Turan. The SHGM criticised the flight crew's decision to ignore the standard safety regulations in several tweets it posted on its official Twitter account. The first tweet noted that 'Flight teams must abide by "Safe Cockpit" rules for the duration of the entire flight. No one but the flight crew should be admitted to the cockpit.' A second tweet pointed out how the pilots were in violation of the 'Safe Cockpit' rules and are subject to a £260 fine, at the very least. The safety breach comes amid heightened concerns over aviation security after the Germanwings airliner crash in which all 150 people on board died when the plane's co-pilot deliberately flew the Airbus jet into the ground.

An undergraduate student at Duke University has admitted to hanging a noose in a tree and is no longer on campus, university officials said Thursday. At a news conference Thursday afternoon, school spokesman Michael Schoenfeld said the school would not release the name of the student who admitted to hanging the noose, found early Wednesday in a plaza area at the heart of the campus. The student was identified with information provided by other students and will be subject to Duke's student conduct process and that an investigation is continuing to find out if others were involved, Schoenfeld said. Identified: Officials at Duke University say they have caught the student culprit responsible for hanging a noose from a tree on campus this week . Taking a stand: The noose sparked a mass protest on campus on Wednesday. The noose is a particularly sensitive image in the state, where black residents were once terrorized by lynchings . Schoenfeld said the school believes federal education laws protecting information about students and their grades prevent the school from describing his or her gender, race or whether the student had been in trouble in the past. The school also is working with state and federal officials about potential criminal violations. Officials say the noose was found about 2am Wednesday in the plaza outside the Bryan Center, the student commons building. Black Student Alliance vice president Henry Washington said he and about 14 other students saw the noose hanging overnight after being alerted via Twitter. On Thursday, he praised the reaction of fellow students and administrators at the school. 'I appreciate that immediate action was taken both by the student community to identify a person and by the faculty to ensure that disciplinary action is taken,' he said. Unknown: The university is not identifying the student in question, citing federal education laws protecting student privacy. Above, a view of the Durham, North Carolina campus . Duke Student Affairs Vice President Larry Moneta said the student would face judgment under the school's code of conduct, which includes penalties ranging from probation to expulsion. He said it was 'too soon to make any comment' about whether the student had expressed remorse for the noose episode. 'This is all part of what the investigation will yield and the opportunity for the student to speak to the basis for the behavior,' Moneta said. At a gathering Wednesday in front of the university's Gothic chapel building, Duke President Richard Brodhead told a crowd of several thousand that their presence was a rejection of what the noose symbolizes in a region where lynchings were once used to terrorize black residents. And he said that while administrators and campus police investigate who displayed the noose and why, it is up to each individual to reject racism. 'One person put up that noose, but this is the multitude of people who got together to say that's not the Duke we want,' he told the crowd. 'That's not the Duke we're here for, and that's not the Duke we're here to create.'
Self-styled 'anarchist libertarian' squatters have set up camp in one of London's most historic monuments and unfurled banners reading  'Homes for all'. The protesters mounted Admiralty Arch, which joins Trafalgar Square with the Mall, and called for others to join them. It is not clear what their protest is attempting to highlight, as a garbled message posted on Facebook by the group simply calls for 'Christmas lights... any and all radical/revolutionary messages'. But banners bearing messages such as 'better squat than let homes rot' and 'respect existence or expect resistance' were seen hanging from the Grade-I listed building, as the masked demonstrators sat with their legs dangling over the side. Scroll down for video . Self-styled 'anarchist libertarian' squatters have set up camp in one of London's most historic monuments and unfurled banners reading 'Homes for all' One of the banners read, 'Respect existence or expect resistance' and another, 'better to squat than let homes rot' The protesters mounted the arch which joins Trafalgar Square with the Mall, and called for others to join them . It is not clear what their protest is attempting to highlight, as a garbled message posted on Facebook by the group simply calls for 'Christmas lights... any and all radical/revolutionary messages' The gatehouse, built as a memorial to Queen Victoria, was sold in 2012 after a Spanish hotel developer paid £60 million to buy it from the government. The five protesters from anti fascist group 'Autonomous Nation of Anarchist Libertarians (ANAL)' called for support in a message on their Facebook page as police converged on the area. They posted: 'Urgent shoutout for banners, Christmas lights and anything else we can use to make the most of this massive canvas we have. Any and all radical/revolutionary messages welcome, but a preference for antifa (sic) in anticipation of the pegeda event on the 4th of this month. Much love.' One onlooker, who asked not to be named, said: 'I've seen a couple of guys on different parts of the roof throughout this morning. 'All they were doing was shouting power to the people. I have no idea how they got in there because I'm pretty sure it's offices.' A man was walking across the roof of the arch this afternoon wearing a black sleeveless hoodie with the hood pulled up and a black scarf across his face. They added five photographs of themselves up on the building. They are believed to be the same group who took over the former offices of the Institute of Directors on Pall Mall in central London last month. The building, not far from Buckingham Palace, was targeted because it was originally opened by Tony Blair, the groups said at the time. The squatters later bragged that it 'wasn't difficult' to get into the historic landmark which is a five minutes walk from Buckingham Palace. The group said they got into the building overnight by climbing through an unlocked window. Proclaiming that what they were doing was 'more punk rock than the Sex Pistols,' one of the men, who only gave his name as 'Fox' said the group decided to take Admiralty Arch because it was a 'significant' building a stone's throw away from the Palace. 'Fox', who claimed to be one of the founders of the Autonomous Nation, said: ' We decided to take it because it is a significant building - you can see Buckingham Palace - there is a significant flow of traffic and we wanted to highlight the fact there are some corrupt individuals affecting this country and they need to get dragged out. Banners bearing housing messages were seen hanging from the Grade-I listed building as the masked demonstrators sat with their legs dangling over the side . 'Also, we wanted to highlight the fact that there are so many people that are homeless. 'We got in overnight through a window that was unlocked and just climbed in through that, there's about 15 of us here. 'The ironic thing is that we had been evicted from the building in Pall Mall and all we were doing was walking around here when a security guard said 'you can't come in here, you can't take this' - which said to us it must be empty and that's when we decided we could take it. 'We are trying our hardest to keep it clean and tidy, but when your squatting in central London the chaos does take its toll. 'We want to stay here as long as we can.' Fox admitted he was one of the hooded figures seen standing on the roof of the arch today and said he was shouting 'power to the people.' He also said that some of his colleagues were shouting 'ACAB' which stands for 'All Cops are B*****ds.' He added: 'That is not something I join in with [shouting about police] because I find a lot of police officers can be quite reasonable.' A 'Notice to Vacate' has been posted up the entrances to the landmark, however Fox warned that if the group are evicted 'There may be some individuals that do resistance. ' Another squatter, who asked not to be named, said: 'We decided to take it because it is two fingers up to the Royal Family. 'We are anarchists, we are not left wing or right wing, we are anarchists - look up the dictionary definition of the word. 'The Sex Pistols need to start doing a new album because what we are doing is more punk rock than the Sex Pistols.' Asked how long he wanted to squat in the landmark he replied 'indefinitely.' It is not the first time protesters have 'taken over' Admiralty Arch. In 2006, 14 Greenpeace protesters spent a day on the arch demonstrating over claims the government is using illegally logged wood. The gatehouse, built as a memorial to Queen Victoria, was sold in 2012 after a Spanish hotel developer paid £60 million to buy it from the government .

They added five photographs of themselves up on the building. It is not the first time protesters have 'taken over' the memorial . They unfurled banners accusing the government of 'trashing rainforests' during Cabinet Office renovations . A Metropolitan Police spokeswoman said: 'At approximately 10.22 this morning we were made aware of five protesters on the roof of Admiralty Arch opposite Trafalgar Square. 'They remain on the roof. Officers are in attendance.' Facebook user Love Activists posted: 'Love activists, SHA and the Autonomous Nation Of Anarchist Libertarians have occupied the old cabinet office opposite trafalgar square, on the road which leads directly towards the palace. We call out for all hands to assist us.' Another user Natasha Quarmby added: 'The Guinness Trust AST tenants are in court today, trying to save their homes, they are on their own, and not getting the support that perhaps other Social Housing campaigns are getting, like the Aylesbury Estate or Sweets Way.... I urge you to visit to visit their page and show some support, they would really appreciate it. 'What about these guys too, No Russel Brand on hand here.... Show them some support x (sic)' Tenants face losing their homes for a new housing development on the Guinness Estate in Loughborough Park, Brixton, and have been staging protests. Housing trust the Guinness Partnership is planning to redevelop the estate and create 525 new homes on the site. Tenants on shorthold tenancy contracts have been told they have until April to find new housing. Many of the tenants have been living in the building for over 10 years and claim they will have to find somewhere to live outside London as they can no longer afford to pay Brixton rent prices. Admiralty Arch was commissioned by King Edward VII as a memorial to his mother, Queen Victoria, and was designed by the architect Sir Aston Webb. Completed in 1912, it spans the entrance to Trafalgar Square from The Mall and was traditionally used as the residence of the First Sea Lord and the heads of the Royal Navy. Admiralty Arch was commissioned by King Edward VII as a memorial to his mother, Queen Victoria, and was designed by the architect Sir Aston Webb. It is pictured during the Royal Wedding of Princess Elizabeth (Queen Elizabeth II) and Prince Philip (Duke of Edinburgh) at Westminster Abbey in November 1947 . Neighbouring Admiralty House has provided grace-and-favour apartments for politicians including former defence secretary Liam Fox and former deputy prime minister John Prescott. The 147,300sq ft arch is spread across a basement, lower ground and ground floor, and five upper floors. The Government sold the long-term lease on the building in 2013. It is retaining the freehold, so will still have the final say after a Spanish hotel developer paid £60 million to buy it. Nights in the historic landmark, which joins Trafalgar Square with the Mall, won't come cheaply though; new owner Rafael Serrano is also the man behind the Bulgari Hotel in Knightsbridge, where rooms cost from £850 a night.
SPFL clubs are poised to do battle over a late Hibernian move to cash in on the Premiership play-offs. Currently second in the Championship, the Easter Road club stand to make £1million from anticipated sell-out home gates against Rangers and the 11th place club in the Premiership - currently Motherwell. Under recently passed SPFL rules, however, play-off sides must hand over 50 per cent of their play-off profits for distribution among lower league clubs within seven days. And, faced with the possible loss of substantial sums from two lucrative matches, Hibs chairman Rod Petrie has garnered support from Hearts and Motherwell for a resolution to slash the profits levied from play-off finalists from 50 per cent to 25 per cent. The issue will go to the vote at the SPFL AGM next Thursday, but faces opposition from the SPFL board who believe the move puts self-interest above those of all 42 clubs. Hibernian face a battle over potentially lucrative gate revenues with lower league clubs . On Tuesday, one senior club figure told Sportsmail on condition of anonymity, that the Hibs, Hearts and Motherwell proposal was ‘outrageous’. ‘The agreement two years ago was that the clubs from the bottom three divisions would get more of the money,’ Sportsmail was told. ‘As part of that overall package we agreed a levy on the play-offs. No one at that time anticipated you might have a Rangers-Hibs play-off final. ‘Now there is a move by people with vested interests to say “we might be doing ourselves out of a bit of money!”. And they are attempting to revisit it. ‘That’s potentially outrageous because all clubs voted for the restructuring on the basis of the overall package and you can’t suddenly decide later that because you are in the play-offs you are not happy with it.’ Hibernian declined to comment last night although the Easter Road club will argue that funding for lower league clubs will be unaffected by slashing the levy because of a new six-figure broadcast deal for the play-offs and the imposition by the SPFL of new minimum pricing policy of £15 and £10 for all six matches. Hibs would have to hand over 50 per cent of play-off gate revenues to lower league clubs under SPFL rules . Hibernian are believed to have had reservations over the 50 per cent levy before the redistribution package was passed and have now gathered backing to revisit the issue next Thursday from Motherwell – also likely to be involved in the play-offs – and city rivals Hearts. One Easter Road source told Sportsmail: ‘A rule change has been introduced by the SPFL stopping clubs allowing their season ticket holders into the play-off games for free. ‘They have also imposed a minimum price of £15 and £10 for the play-offs. ‘In addition there was no television money in place for the play-offs last year while this year they have secured six-figure revenues to go round the clubs. ‘Add in the fact the parachute payments to the Premiership clubs are fully funded by the SFA – not the SPFL – and people at Hibs take the view that to hand back 50 per cent of the money generated is excessive and unnecessary. The suggestion that it be reduced is not unreasonable. Hearts and Motherwell agree.’
Teachers are helping pupils to cheat by giving advice during exams, wrongly bumping up marks and even writing coursework, it has been revealed. Tactics used to bend the rules were revealed by more than 500 whistleblowing teachers after an appeal by the exams watchdog. Ofqual found that one in five reported that colleagues had written sections of coursework, dictated essays or provided examples for students to copy. Teachers are helping pupils to cheat by giving advice during exams, wrongly bumping up marks and even writing coursework, it has been revealed (file picture) Details of the unethical techniques emerged at a Teacher Ethics In Assessment symposium at Oxford University. The Sunday Times reported that one teacher told Ofqual: ‘Giving students too much support in their coursework is a massive issue. It ranges from providing them with examples of good work, letting them copy others’ work [and] teachers standing over students telling them what to write.’ Another teacher said she was told she ‘would have to do it herself’ when she raised concerns with her head of department about her class struggling to produce work of sufficient quality. And 15 per cent said staff had given ‘hints’ or ‘pointers’ while invigilating exams. Glenys Stacey, Ofqual’s chief executive, said: ‘Teachers who bend the rules are deeply uncomfortable about it and do it in large part because of the pressure to get results.’ The latest Ofqual figures show 217 penalty notices were issued to schools and colleges for malpractice in 2013 – an increase of 61 per cent on the previous year.

Newcastle will be keen to avoid a third defeat on the spin when they take on rivals Sunderland in Sunday’s crunch derby after floundering in recent weeks without banned striker Papiss Cisse. It is Dick Advocaat’s side who are struggling at the foot of the Barclays Premier League table – sitting perilously one point above the bottom three - but Sportsmail can reveal that John Carver’s team would be two points ADRIFT of their foes in the relegation zone if it weren’t for Cisse’s goals. The Senegal forward is Newcastle’s top scorer this season with 11 goals, with 10 of those decisive in changing games in the Magpies’ favour. Papiss Cisse is Newcastle's top scorer this season with 11 goals - 10 of those were decisive . 20 September Hull (h) 2-2 (2 goals) 4 October Swansea (a) 2-2 (2 goals) 2 December Burnley (a) 1-1 (1 goal) 6 December Chelsea (h) 2-1 (2 goals) 26 December Man Utd (a) 1-3 (1 goal) 28 December Everton (h) 3-2 (1 goal) 11 February Crystal Palace (a) 1-1 (1 goal) 28 February Aston Villa (h) (1 goal) Since his double against Hull rescued a 2-2 draw in September, Cisse has earned Newcastle 11 points with his goalscoring heroics — almost single-handedly lifting them to mid-table. Take those goals away and the Premier League reads somewhat differently. Newcastle languish in 18th place on 24 points in the fantasy table behind Sunderland on 26. They would have scored just 22 times — the second fewest in the division behind Aston Villa — and won only six games. Six of Cisse’s strikes have been against sides in the bottom half and Burnley, Hull, Everton, and Villa would have leapfrogged a Newcastle side shorn of the striker. After his brace against Steve Bruce’s side, Cisse scored another double to clinch a 2-2 draw against Swansea two weeks later. His next goal was a second-half equaliser in a 1-1 with Burnley in December and, four days later, hit another two to seal a 2-1 victory over Chelsea. Later that month he netted in a 3-2 triumph over Everton while in February he scored against his former manager Alan Pardew at Crystal Palace in a 1-1 draw. Cisse also supplied the cutting edge to snatch a 1-0 victory against Villa. The Senegalese striker is currently serving a seven-game ban after clashing with Jonny Evans . 5 April Sunderland (a) 13 April Liverpool (a) 19 April Tottenham (h) 25 April Swansea (h) 2 May Leicester (a) His only goal which hasn’t had affected the outcome of a match was a late consolation penalty in a 3-1 defeat at Old Trafford on Boxing Day. Even when Cisse hasn’t found the net, however, he still has a beneficial impact. Newcastle have a points-to-games ratio of 1.37 when the striker plays but just 0.9 when he doesn’t. In reality, there is little cause for concern as Carver’s side currently sit 10 points clear of the drop zone. But after their trip to the Stadium of Light they will face top-four chasing Liverpool and Tottenham in the coming weeks. Newcastle will be hoping they aren’t looking over their shoulders when Cisse returns for their final three games of the campaign. Cisse nets against Burnley at Turf Moor, a goal that saw Newcastle earn a point in December .
Shot dead: Carlos Manuel Perez Jr, 28, was killed by shotgun blasts from a Nevada corrections officer trying to break up a fight he was in . Nevada prison guards allegedly staged a 'gladiator-like' man-on-man fight between handcuffed inmates in the corridors of a maximum-security prison, then broke it up by opening fire with a shotgun. Carlos Manuel Perez Jr, 28, was allegedly pitted against Andrew Jay Arevalo, 24, inside High Desert State Prison in Indian Springs on November 12 of last year. After the two were left to duke it out, a lawsuit filed in state court claims, a trainee corrections officer waded in and fired off his shotgun four times in a row. The blasts killed Perez and left Arevalo with wounds to his face, according to the suit, which is seeking damages for a slew of allegations, including wrongful death and excessive force. An attorney for the Perez family said the guards knew that if they let the two prisoners - who were supposed to be kept apart - encounter one another in the halls a fight would be inevitable. Cal Potter said: 'Officers know they will see a fight if they release ad seg [administrative segregation] inmates that are supposed to be in walk-alone status.' Perez, a two-time felon, was serving a four-year sentence for hitting a man with a two-by-four, while Arevalo was serving six years for burglary. Arevalo survived the shots, despite wounds to his face. His attorney plans to file a suit soon. The suit, filed in Clark County District Court, said: 'Defendants ... refused to intervene. On the contrary (they) created a gladiator-like scenario and allowed the inmates to fight.' The lawsuit names two corrections officers and the trainee shooter by last name only. It also names as plaintiffs the state of Nevada, prisons chief Greg Cox and the warden, assistant warden and a lieutenant at High Desert State Prison. The suit alleges wrongful death; excessive force; deliberate indifference to Perez's medical needs; negligent training and supervision; and intentional infliction of emotional distress. It seeks unspecified damages, of at least $30,000. 'Gladiator fights': Pictured is High Desert State Prison in Indian Springs, Nevada, where the shooting took place . Clark County's coroner ruled Perez's death a homicide, with a March 3 finding that he died of gunshot wounds to the head, neck, chest and arms. Potter represents Perez's brother, Victor Perez, and mother, Myra Perez, both of Reno, and two children, ages 3 and 2. The lawyer said Perez's family was given conflicting statements during initial meetings with prison administrators after his death, and weren't told Perez had been shot. He said: 'They were devastated three days later when they went to the mortuary and learned that Carlos had ... multiple gunshot wounds to his face and upper body'. Deputy prisons chief Brian Connett has defended the state Department of Corrections as a responsible steward of the safety and security of guards and inmates. He said in a March 27 interview the shooting came in response to two inmates fighting at the 3,500-strong prison. He said the three corrections officers who were involved would remain on paid leave pending action by the attorney general. A statement from the prison's public information office said an investigation of the incident was in the hands of the state attorney general's office. 'The Nevada Department of Corrections does not comment on pending or ongoing litigation,' it said. Attorney General Adam Laxalt's spokeswoman, Patty Cafferata, said the attorney general was reviewing the report, received March 25. Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval has said local, county and state authorities investigated the shooting, and that Laxalt will determine an appropriate course of action. His office refused further comment.
Gary Caldwell admitted his first taste of management was 'crazy' following Wigan's battling 2-2 draw against Fulham. The Latics may be heading for relegation but they proved they are ready to go down fighting after twice coming from behind to snatch a point at Craven Cottage. Caldwell, at 32 the youngest boss in the league, only replaced the axed Malky Mackay on Wednesday and must have feared the worst when his side conceded after just three minutes to Ross McCormack's strike. Gary Caldwell admitted his first taste of management was 'crazy' following Wigan's battling 2-2 draw . Wigan's Jason Pearce (right) is congratulated by Pennant (left) as he scores the second equaliser for his side . A stylish Jermaine Pennant free-kick hauled Wigan level, only for a stunning long-range effort from Matt Smith put Fulham back in front. But Jason Pearce's 69th-minute effort, when he tucked in a corner at the far post, earned the Latics a point. 'I have just said to the players that I feel very proud of them considering we only had two days to work,' said former Latics skipper Caldwell. 'It's crazy, absolutely crazy. An all-consuming job. But I loved every minute of it and can't wait for the next one. I've had a lot of managers texting me saying 'welcome to the madhouse' and I can see what they mean.' A point lifted Wigan above Millwall, who they face on Tuesday, on goal difference but both teams are seven points adrift of safety. Matt Smith scores Fulham's second goal to restore their lead against Wigan at Carven Cottage on Friday . Smith slides to his knees as he celebrates putting the home side back in front in the Championship match . Caldwell has not been put in charge to perform a miracle, but he still insists there is plenty to play for. 'We'll try to win every game,' he added. 'There's 12 points to play for and we'll try to win every one and see what happens. 'It's going to be a long process to get the club to where we want it to be. But tonight was the way we want to play, that's how this club got success.' Fulham should now be safe, having edged nine points clear of the drop zone, but they were booed off by sections of the home support. Boss Kit Symons' honeymoon period seems to be over, as his decision to take off goalscorer Smith after an hour was met with a chorus of 'you don't know what you're doing'. Fulham captain Scott Parker (right) is hassled for the ball by Wigan's Gaetan Bong (left) at Craven Cottage . The ever industrious Parker (left) dribbles away from the challenge of Wigan's Kim Bo-Kyung (right) 'Matt was shattered,' he explained. 'He's had a lot of football recently and we needed some fresh legs.' Symons has the air of a manager who cannot wait for the season to come to an end. 'It's glass half full, glass half empty,' he added. 'We're a point closer to safety and come the end of the season it might be the point that keeps us in the division. 'It's been a tough season, to put it mildly, and realistically it was probably always going to be like that. When we stay up I certainly won't be doing cartwheels, but I'll breathe a sigh of relief.'
House prices across the UK will rise at a fraction of last year’s frenetic pace, forecasts show. Property prices soared by 10 per cent in 2014 but will grow by just 1.5 per cent over the next 12 months. London will fare the worst, with prices actually dropping by 3.6 per cent over the next year, it is claimed. It follows last year’s record price hike of 17.4 per cent in the capital. Economists said that the housing market had ‘got ahead of itself’ last year and would assume a much more leisurely pace in 2015. Scroll down for video . Forecasts show house prices across the UK will rise at a fraction of last year’s frenetic pace. File photo . Annual price growth across the country will then gradually accelerate again over the next five years, hitting 4 per cent by 2020. This year will be the first since 2009 that the UK as a whole out-performs London, according to the Centre for Economics and Business Research. This is because while prices in the capital stagnate, the housing market is still performing well in the East and South-East, and parts of the Midlands and North of England. But the CEBR said this victory for the provinces would be short-lived, since the London market will also recover in 2016. Prices there are set to rise by 2.7 per cent next year, above the national average of 2.3 per cent. London homes will also suffer no more price falls in the foreseeable future – and are forecast to see annual growth of an estimated 4.7 per cent by 2020. The predictions from economists at the think-tank were upgraded from their forecast in January, when they suggested average prices would fall this year. They said that radical changes to stamp duty had given the market a boost. In recent years many Britons had been deterred from moving home for fear of the punitive tax on house purchases. The tax was charged on the whole value of a property and successive governments had failed to increase thresholds, trapping growing numbers of families above a £125,000 threshold. London will fare the worst, with prices actually dropping by 3.6 per cent over the next year. File photo . But, in December, the Coalition overhauled the system, replacing the unfair ‘slab’ structure with gradually increasing rates, which cut tax bills for the vast majority of movers. Economist Scott Corfe, of the CEBR, said: ‘House price growth in the UK will rise much slower than last year – but it will still be positive. ‘The market got a bit ahead of itself last year, and at the end of 2014 it began slowing down and plateaued. ‘It has now started to pick up again outside London. We are still not building enough houses to keep pace with population growth so, as long as we have a shortage of supply, prices will keep rising. ‘House prices will continue to grow faster than inflation.’ It was a different story in London, however, where he said interest from overseas buyers had dwindled, pushing down prices. While the stamp duty changes meant lower bills for the majority, those buying million-pound homes have been hit by higher rates – deterring international investors and many wealthy Londoners. Mr Corfe said: ‘Stamp duty reform, as well as the depreciation of the euro against the pound – making London more expensive for European buyers – has affected prices in the capital. ‘Uncertainty around the general election and fears of a mansion tax [under Labour’s plans] may have also driven down demand since the start of the year.’
Students have fallen out of love with the Green party, after a dramatic slump in support for their leader Natalie Bennett, a new poll shows. On the day the party launches its Youth Manifesto, a survey reveals only 15 per cent of people at university now say they plan to vote to vote Green, down from 28 per cent in February. After a series of faltering media performances by Ms Bennett, the proportion of students who dislike her has doubled since September to 24 per cent. Scroll down for video . A new survey of students reveals a dramatic fall in support for the Green party, down to 15 per cent from 28 per cent in February . Since September, the proportion of students who dislike Green leader Natalie Bennett has doubled to 24 per cent, although Ukip's Nigel Farage remains the most unpopular . There was a time when the Lib Dems could bank on the support of students, but Nick Clegg reneging on his promise to scrap tuition fees saw his supporters desert him in their droves. Labour has been the main beneficiary, with 35 per cent now saying they will vote for Ed Miliband, although this has fallen from 46 per cent in September 2013, according to YouthSight. Support for the Greens rose steadily over two years, and peaked at 28 per cent in February. But since then it has dropped sharply to only 15 per cent, meaning they have now been overtaken by the Conservatives who are on 25 per cent. YouthSight interviews around 1,000 undergraduates across the UK for its surveys. Ms Bennett's profile has soared in recent months, buoyed by rising poll ratings and Green party membership in England passing 60,000 for the first time. But she has struggled in media performances, including a radio interview when she suffered a 'brain fade' while discussing housing policy and a TV grilling in which she said it should not be a criminal offence to join extremist groups like ISIS or Al Qaeda. She has also failed to make an impact in the TV leaders' debates, which have been dominated by the SNP's Nicola Sturgeon and Ukip's Nigel Farage. Ms Bennett's profile has soared in recent months, buoyed by rising poll ratings and Green party membership in England passing 60,000 for the first time but she has been stung by poor media performances . In September, 12 per cent of students said they disliked Ms Bennett but this month the figure has leapt to 24 per cent. Over the same period David Cameron and Nick Clegg have seen falls in their levels of dislike, while Ed Miliband remains on 28 per cent. Ben Marks, managing director of YouthSight said: 'Our recent waves of polling data have charted the Green Party's rise amongst students, steadily climbing past the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives. 'However as the election approaches the Green bubble, if not quite burst, seems at least to be deflating. 'This latest wave sees the Greens fall 13 points, from 28 per cent to 15 per cent, losing second place for the first time this year. 'It appears that the Green Party are struggling to compete with the more established parties now that election campaigning has begun in earnest. This is also potentially evidence of a 'protest vote' ebbing away.' The Green party today launched their Youth Manifesto with a pledge to invest an extra £1.1billion in youth services, creating 2,000 new Young People's Centres. As the party launched its Youth Manifesto today, there were questions about Ms Bennett's leadership after it emerged her boyfriend had written bizarre blogs about rape, kidnap and murder . But deputy leader Amelia Womack faced questions about Ms Bennett's leadership after it emerged her boyfriend had written bizarre blogs about rape, kidnap and murder. Jim Jepps used a blog called The Daily Maybe to defend 'rape fantasies', describe paedophiles as 'complex human beings' and question why teachers who have relationships with pupils are put on the sex offenders register. The couple met five years ago when Ms Bennett contacted him to correct something he had written about her. However, the Green party stresses they do not 'want to be associated' with his internet rants. Speaking at the launch of the party's youth manifesto in Kentish Town, north London, Ms Womack said: 'Jim isn't anything to do with the Green Party and he isn't a member. 'But obviously ... obviously there is a lot of, kind of ... He hasn't put himself in the public profile, it is Natalie whose put herself into the public eye and so it is ... basically it must be really hard to have her public life, sorry her private life, brought into the public like this.' Asked if she thought the reports would damage the party's image or reputation, she said: 'Well, I think it's very clear that Jim isn't part of the party and that Natalie is our spokesperson and these aren't opinions that are held by Natalie and they're certainly not opinions that are held by the Green Party and opinions that are condemned by the Green Party - but it is Natalie who is our spokesperson.'
Audi has created a so-called 'green' diesel fuel made using a combination of water and carbon dioxide. The car manufacturer described its breakthrough as the 'fuel of the future' and claims it could provide a carbon neutral way of powering vehicles. Experts used renewable energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into a form of crude oil known as 'blue crude', which was then refined into diesel. Scroll down for video . Audi claims to have created the fuel of the future - diesel (shown above) made from water and carbon dioxide. Experts used renewable energy to convert the carbon dioxide and water into a form of crude oil known as 'blue crude', which was then refined into diesel . Tests have shown it can be mixed with diesel from fossil fuels, or used as a fuel in its own right. Audi has already begun using the new e-diesel to power the official car of German minister of education and research Dr Johanna Wanka. Reiner Mangold, head of sustainable product development at Audi, said: 'In developing Audi e-diesel we are promoting another fuel based on carbon dioxide that will allow long‑distance mobility with virtually no impact on the climate. Audi's fuel was developed with Sunfire, a Dresden-based energy technology company. To make the fuel, water is first heated to form steam which is then broken down into its constituent hydrogen and oxygen using high-temperature electrolysis. By performing this process at temperatures above 800°C (1,472°F), the water breaks down with greater efficiency than at room temperature. The hydrogen is then pumped into a reactor with carbon dioxide at high pressure and high temperatures. This causes them to react to produce long-chained liquid hydrocarbons. Hydrocarbons are the basic building block of all fossil fuels, but the compounds produced in the reactor are known as 'blue crude'. Audi claims the whole process can be powered using renewable energy and can be achieved with an efficiency of around 70%. The blue crude can then be refined in a similar way to standard crude oil to produce e-diesel. 'Using carbon dioxide as a raw material represents an opportunity not just for the automotive industry in Germany, but also to transfer the principle to other sectors and countries.'

To make the fuel, water is first heated to form steam, which is then broken down into its constituent hydrogen and oxygen using high-temperature electrolysis. By performing this process at temperatures above 800°C (1,472°F), the water breaks down with greater efficiency than at room temperature.

Hydrogen is  pumped into a reactor with carbon dioxide at high pressure and high temperatures and causes them to react to produce liquid hydrocarbons, known as 'blue crude'. Hydrocarbons form the base of fossil fuels . Audi added that the synthetic fuel does not contain sulphur or hydrocarbon rings – known as aromatic hydrocarbons – which are found in crude oil and can create additional pollution. A breakthrough was recently made in the development of clean hydrogen power. Currently, while hydrogen fuel is appealing, the production of hydrogen is incredible difficult - requiring huge amounts of energy. But the researchers say they have made a new material that can generate hydrogen from water, meaning it is less reliant on fossil fuels. Researchers at the University of Bath and Yale University have designed a molecular catalyst to split water in an electrolyser and create clean and storable hydrogen fuel. The approach increases the efficiency of electrolysis of water into its constituent parts by reducing the amount of energy needed to perform the  oxidation half of the reaction. Christian von Olshausen, chief technology officer at Sunfire, said the fuel was highly combustible and produced less pollution than traditional diesel. He said: 'The engine runs quieter and fewer pollutants are being created.' A special processing plant has been built in Dresden Reick and is set to produce 3,000 litres of e-diesel in the coming months. The carbon dioxide is currently supplied by a biogas facility as a byproduct. Audi said it also extracts carbon dioxide from the ambient air using 'direct air capturing'. Burning of fossil fuels is the main source of carbon dioxide emissions by humans into the atmosphere and is driving global warming. By capturing emissions from power plants and removing it from the air, Audi says its new fuel can be used without adding to the burden of gas in the atmosphere. The project is the latest attempt by Audi to produce more environmentally friendly fuels for its vehicles. Audi has already begun using the new e-diesel to power the official car of German minister of education and research Dr Johanna Wanka. The minister is pictured testing the new fuel in her official car . In 2009 it announced a project to produce e-gas - a form of synthetic methane – for use in its g-tron gas powered vehicles. At the launch of the new e-diesel, Dr Wanka put five litres of the fuel into her official Audi A8. She said: 'This synthetic diesel, made using carbon dioxide, is a huge success for our sustainability research. 'If we can make widespread use of carbon dioxide as a raw material, we will make a crucial contribution to climate protection and the efficient use of resources, and put the fundamentals of the "green economy" in place.'
A police crime commissioner is facing investigation after awarding more than half a million pounds of taxpayers' money to the charity she runs alongside the force's chief. Vera Baird donated £500,000 to Victims First Northumbria, a charity which supports crime victims in her area and of which she is a director. Sitting alongside her on the organisation's top table is Sue Sim, Northumbria's Chief Constable, records revealed. The pair now face a Ministry of Justice probe as critics accuse them of concocting 'a soap opera' within the force. Vera Baird, the Police and Crime Commissioner for Northumbria, faces a Ministry of Justice investigation after allocating more than £500,00 of public money to a charity of which she is the director . Sitting alongside Ms Baird on Victims First Northumbria's top table is Chief Constable Sue Sim. The pair are pictured together, above . It comes after the Home Secretary implemented a rule allowing PCCs to commission services for victims of crime. Last month Ms Baird boasted of the securing of funds for the charity in an article on its website. 'From April 1, I become responsible for some victims’ services after funding was devolved by the Ministry of Justice to PCCs,' she wrote. A Northumbria Police spokesman said the funds would be allocated 'in the same manner that Victim Support were directly funded by the MOJ'. But critics have described her selection of charity as 'inappropriate' and a conflict of interest. Keith Vaz, the Labour chairman of the Home Affairs committee, said: 'Northumbria police appears to have developed its own soap opera. 'It is totally inappropriate for a PCC to set up any organisation in which they have an interest of whatever kind using public money.' In an article on the charity's website, Ms Baird boasted of securing the funds from the public purse last month . Mrs Sim shot to prominence within the force over her handling of the hunt for Raoul Moat in 2010. She is pictured above with Deputy Chief Superintendent Neil Adamson at a press conference following his death . Adding the fact that Chief Constable Sue Sim was 'wrong', Mr Vaz said commissioners should never have been given the ability to allocate public funds to charity. 'The Home Secretary should never have given these powers.' Ms Baird stood by her decision today, telling MailOnline: 'All Ministry of Justice procedures and protocols were adhered to. Keith Vaz accused the force of creating its own 'soap opera' 'I am confident the team of coordinators will show that the decisions taken to create Victims First Northumbria were the right ones.' Mrs Sim has already announced that she will be retiring from the force in June. She was previously accused of bullying staff and faced an investigation that was spearheaded by Ms Baird, her co-director at Victims First Northumbria. A Ministry of Justice spokesman confirmed it would investigate the circumstances to conclude whether any conflict of interest rules had been broken. 'The MoJ requires PCCs not to be subject to conflicts of interest when providing victims services and has the power to investigate any possible conflict of interest and to cease funding if such a conflict is established.' Victims First Northumbria was established after the number of people contacting its predecessor, Victim Support, plummeted. But sources say many may be reluctant to confide in a service that is partly run by Mrs Sim who faced misconduct proceedings over alleged workplace bullying before announcing her retirement last week. The police chief who shot to prominence after her handling of the Raoul Moat manhunt in 2010, said she was stepping down to spend more time with her family. Ms Baird praised her 'passion and enthusiasm', adding: 'Sue and I have worked well together over the two-and-a-half years since I became police and crime commissioner.'
Some vegetarians start young, as this comical video demonstrates. Footage shows three-year-old Luiz Antonio from Brazil being presented with a fanciful dish of octopus gnocchi at the dinner table. But instead of digging into the seafood feast, he starts asking about where the tentacled creature set before him came from with English subtitles detailing his train of thought. 'This octopus isn't real is it? Where's its head? Is its head in the sea? Did the man hack it [off]?' the youngster says while grimacing at his dinner plate. Scroll down for video . Yuck! Footage shows three-year-old Luiz Antonio from Brazil being presented with a fanciful dish of octopus gnocchi at the dinner table . Pulling faces: But instead of digging into the seafood feast he starts asking about where the tentacled creature set before him came from with English subtitles detailing his train of thought . His mother reassures him that she only cooked using the octopuses 'little legs chopped'. She adds that the creature had to be dissected so it could be eaten. 'Or we'd have to swallow it whole,' she notes. Luiz remains uninspired by his dinner. He then puts forwards the argument that octopus is an  animal just like chicken, pig, cow and fish. He continues: 'So when we eat the animals they die. Why?  I don’t like that they die. I like that they keep standing and happy. Look of horror: Luiz's mother reassures him that she only cooked using the octopuses 'little legs chopped' Comical scene: His mother is reduced to tears through laughter as she listens to the case in hand . Getting his way: After more than two minutes of discussion, Luiz is told he doesn't have to eat the octopus and he can just stick to the potato and rice instead . 'Those animals are for us to take care, not eat them.' His mother is reduced to tears through laughter as she listens to the case in hand. 'I'm just a little moved by you,' she chuckles when Luiz asks what's wrong. After more than two minutes of discussion, Luiz is told he doesn't have to eat the octopus and he can just stick to the potato and rice instead. Although the clip was filmed almost two years ago, it has recently resurfaced online. To date it has been watched more than 4.8 million times. It's not known if Luiz has stuck to his vegetarian pledge.
British Olympic chief Bill Sweeney insists the association worked 'really hard' to keep Aaron Cook on board - but the 24-year-old was set on changing his nationality and competing for Moldova at the 2016 Olympics. Dorset-born Cook who was overlooked for the Great Britain taekwondo squad at London 2012, applied for citizenship earlier this month after receiving funding from Moldovan billionaire Igor Iuzefovici and has already received his passport from the small eastern European state. The British Olympic Association (BOA) announced on Thursday morning that they had ratified the 24-year-old's move - issuing a statement to confirm the news. Taekwondo fighter Aaron Cook's application to switch allegiances to Moldova has been approved . Three time European champion Aaron Cook (right) has refused to fight for Great Britain since May 2012 . Cook has felt aggrieved at the decision to leave him out of the 2012 London Olympic squad . 'Following a request from taekwondo athlete Aaron Cook to change his sporting nationality from British to Moldovan, the British Olympic Association (BOA) today announced that Cook's request has been approved,' it read. 'The board of the British Olympic Association met on Monday 13 April 2015 to discuss Aaron Cook's request to change his sporting nationality.' There had been long-standing animosity from Cook towards GB Taekwondo after he felt he had been kept out of the squad for London 2012 because he had decided to quit the British programme in 2011. Lutalo Muhammed was selected instead and won the bronze medal, but Sweeney says the door was open for Cook - who has instead opted to represent Moldova. 'We are very disappointed,' the BOA chief executive told BBC Radio Five. 'He is world number one and Olympic-ranked number two. He is a great athlete... and we are saddened to lose an athlete of that calibre who is British. 'For him to move from his country of birth and home nation to represent another country - we are disappointed. 'I can promise you we have been working really hard not only in recent months but for a long time now, both with Aaron and his representatives and British Taekwondo. It has been well documented that there have been some difficulties in that relationship that go back to pre-2012. 'We have been looking to find a solution where we could broker that deal. We have worked hard to make sure there is a robust and fair selection policy in place. He was the name quota athlete to go to Baku European Games in June but in his mind he feels his best opportunity to get to the Olympic Games in 2016 is with another country.' Cook, who fought for Team GB at Beijing 2008, announced his intention to change nationality in a statement on Facebook at the start of April, saying: 'Although I am upset and disappointed I will not represent my country of birth at another major championships, I felt I had no other option. 'Having received no funding or support from the GB system and financing myself since June 2011, this was not a situation that was acceptable to me and I did not want to put myself, family, friends, supporters or sport through the same situation we were forced to endure at the London 2012 Olympic Games.' Jeremy Beard, the chairman of GB Taekwondo, said in a statement: 'Having secured his place at the upcoming European Games, we are naturally disappointed that Aaron Cook does not wish to represent Great Britain in Baku, nor at the Olympic Games in Rio. 'We have made exhaustive efforts to engage with him and his team for some time, but sadly it seems that he has made the decision that his future lies elsewhere and we wish him well. British Olympic chief Bill Sweeney says there was nothing that could have stopped Cook switching . Cook competes against Mauro Sarmiento at the Olympic Games in Beijing in 2008 . Jamie Cunningham, Cook's former agent, is pleased he has a pathway to the Olympic games . 'Our focus now is on providing the best support we can to the athletes striving to achieve medal success for Great Britain in Baku, at the upcoming World Championships in Russia next month and ultimately at the Olympic Games in 2016.' Cook has previously said he hopes to represent Moldova for the first time at the inaugural Baku European Games in June. His former agent, Jamie Cunningham, tweeted: 'Delighted @aaroncooktkd has clear route to #Rio @& opp to show 2012 was personal. Pity that he won't be @TeamGB but.... #moveon #road2rio.'
Britain's public schools are now the very image of tradition but behind their establishment image lies a history of rebellion and revolution. The hidden story of some of the country’s most prestigious and best-known public schools -including Eton – is one of barricades and mutinies so fierce they nearly proved the institutions’ undoing. A new book by former education journalist David Turner, The Old Boys, lays bare the little-known history. Scroll down for video . Eton's famous wall game: The new book was inspired by David Cameron's comparison to Flashman in Tom Brown's School Days . Winchester College experienced six full-scale rebellion in the 18th and 19th Centuries - one over beer rations . Years of research in the schools’ archives has shed light on tales of master’s held at sword-point, mass walkouts and battles so intense they required the intervention of a militia,  the Daily Telegraph reported. There are even records of one gunpowder plot. Mr Turner was inspired to write the book after hearing David Cameron, a former Eton College student, compared to the fictional bully Flashman from Tom Brown’s School Days. A student at Winchester practices fencing: Students used swords, axes and gunpowder in their rebellions . Eddie Redmayne (left) and Benedict Cumberbatch (right) both attended public school, which Mr Turner says is now entering its golden age . Turner writes that he wanted to discover whether or not public schools had plumbed the depths described in the Thomas Hughes novels. After making his discoveries he said if they have not improved, Britain is in serious trouble. From the 18th Century onwards there were a series of full-scale rebellions at the country’s public schools the new book reveals. The frequent violence and the outmoded classics-based education at the schools nearly undid them. Turner explains it was predominantly the rise of the pushy parent at the end of 19th Century which brought the institutions to heel. Now, he says, they do more good than harm in the modern era. George Orwell (left) and Ropert Walpole (right), the first British Prime Minister, are often cited as famous examples of the success of the public school system. Walpole attended Eton during the time of unrest . Eton College as it is now: Mr Turner says in the modern era the schools do more good than harm . In fact Turner’s book places the golden age of the Public School not in the distant past, as might be expected, but in the present day, the Financial Times reports. The Old Boys, Mr Turner says, shows the private school system’s ability to adapt and evolve throughout the ages with public school educated celebrities now in the ascendance. Over a third of the UK’s gold medal winners attended fee-paying schools and Eddie Remayne and Benedict Cumberbatch of Eton and Harrow went head to head this year at the Oscars. The current Prime Minister and future King: Both David Cameron and Prince William went to Eton College . A number of modern days figures are name checked in the book including Mumford and Sons from King’s College with David Cameron providing inspiration for the text. However some individuals' lesser known for their private school background such as UKIP party leader Nigel Farage, who attended Dulwhich College, also pop up. The old stalwarts of public school achievement also feature – the country’s first Prime Minister Robert Walpole and the seven public schoolboys in his cabinet as well as Greorge Orwell, who also attended Eton. The Old Boys is now available to buy. Malborough College's 1851 rebellion coincided with Guy Fawkes Night and began with an explosion . At Winchester in 1710, scholars at mutinied over their beer rations. Just before the turn of the century, two decades earlier, students at Manchester Grammar School were supplied by local people with firearms and and food as they embarked upon a violent two-week standoff with their teachers. The disagreement began over the length of the Christmas holidays. In 1797 pupils at Rugby School took staff prisoner at sword-point and a local militia had to be raised to end the insurrection. In 1818 during the ‘great rebellion’ at Winchester the school’s overall head was held hostage by boys armed with axes. In 1851 a mutiny was timed at Malborough College to coincide with Guy Fawkes Night. It began with an explosion from a barrel of gunpowder. Over the period Eton and Winchester both suffered six rebellions each with five at Rugby School.
Obesity risk: Sugary dishes are being promoted by the Government's flagship anti-obesity initiative . Dishes that contain 'shocking' amounts of sugar are being promoted as healthy eating options by the Government's flagship anti-obesity initiative. Change4Life, which is being run by Public Health England to help address the country's obesity crisis, is promoting dishes on its website with up to 29g of sugar per serving – about seven teaspoons' worth. Its Apricot Bread Pudding has slightly more sugar than a Snickers bar, which has 27g. A Banana and Apricot Bagel, promoted as a breakfast, has more sugar than a bowl of Frosties – a cereal so sugary Labour's health spokesman Andy Burnham once said he would consider banning it. Two other dishes, Banana and Sultana Bread and Butter Pudding, and Banana Muffins, contain 25g per serving. Cardiologist Dr Aseem Malhotra, of campaign group Action On Sugar, said he found the advice 'disturbing' and that Change4Life was 'legitimising unhealthy foods'. He added: 'One has to seriously ask whether Change4Life is fit for purpose when it's promoting foods with shocking levels of sugar.' Dr Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at Public Health England, said: 'The majority of these recipes are fruit-based. 'Fruit naturally contains sugar – but it is the sugar that is added to food that we eat too much of. Fruit is a healthier choice.' But Dr Malhotra pointed out that recent research had found even fruit sugars could be harmful in large quantities, particularly to those at risk of type 2 diabetes. Sugary: Change4Life, which is being run by Public Health England, has dishes on its website with more sugar than a bowl of Frosties .
A former commander of the Metropolitan Police's elite Flying Squad has said the Hatton Garden gem heist could be linked to the huge underground fire which ripped through London last week. The massive fire started  last Wednesday and took more than 24 hours to put out. John O'Connor, a highly experienced former police detective, has claimed the major power outage and the proximity of the multi-million burglary was far more than a coincidence. Scroll down for video . A gang of criminals broke into the Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd over the Easter Bank Holiday weekend . It came shortly after firefighters  battled a major fire in Holborn - just 500 metres from the raid site . Speaking on LBC, Mr O'Connor said: 'Yeah, I think that probably was deliberate. 'I've never heard of an outage of electricity like that causing a fire that lasted as long as that. That seems to me as too much of a coincidence.' He also said that in his opinion, to succeed with such a complicated and ambitious crime, the gang must have had some inside help. He added: 'You're gonna have to have a detailed layout of the whole of the business. So clearly they got that from somebody on the inside.' He later told Sky News: 'You've got a major strong room, there's no sign of a forced entry, they've apparently been able to abseil down the lift shaft to get access to the vault - I just find it astonishing that it was that easy. 'The fact that there is no sign of forced entry, what does that mean? That someone left the door open? That someone left the windows open? Former head of Scotland Yard's Flying Squad, John O'Connor, pictured, said the Holborn fire and the raid could be linked . 'It smacks all the time of inside aid, all of the way through it. This doesn't look to me like a genuine sort of smash and grab raid by determined criminals, this looks like they've had accomplices on the inside.You wouldn't go to attack a building like that unless you knew you could gain access.' The London Fire Brigade said they do not believe that the blaze was caused deliberately. Fire experts said their initial assessment showed that the fire was caused by an electrical fault in the Victorian tunnels running below ground, damaging an eight inch gas main which ruptured and fuelled the flames. Fresh details of the daring heist emerged yesterday as police forensic teams continued to sift through the rubble in the vault. It is believed an alarm was triggered when the professional gang broke into the building in the heart of London’s jewellery district. A security guard is understood to have made a cursory check of the property on Good Friday before leaving when he found nothing untoward. Police have refused to say whether officers were despatched to investigate around the same time. The gang used a heavy-duty drill weighing 77lb to bore through a reinforced 7ft concrete wall to reach the vault. When the raid was discovered on Tuesday, police discovered cheaper jewels left strewn amid a large heap of rubble in the vault. Detective Chief Inspector Paul Johnson of the Flying Squad said: ‘I’d say it’s a sophisticated offence and clearly it would have taken some pre-planning. It’s organised. It’s people who have planned it and they know how they were going to go about it. ‘I would imagine that the pool of people [who could carry out the heist] is quite limited.’ The  fire started underground just several hundred yards from where the heist took place a few days later . The gang is thought to have hidden in an office before abseiling down a lift shaft and drilling into a vault . It has also emerged that celebrities and Premier League footballers could be among the victims of the thieves. A source told the Daily Mail: ‘At least two of the jewellers have gems in the vault which have been bought by footballers and celebrities. They are waiting nervously to find out if they are among the victims.’ Mr Johnson described how the gang gained access to one of the offices on the second floor of the building where they disabled the lift before climbing down. Once in the basement the thieves forced open the lift doors to get close to the vault. They used a £3,500 Hilti DD350 drill, which is commonly used on large construction sites, to drill through the reinforced concrete wall to reach the vault. Joel Vinsant, secretary of the Drilling and Sawing Association, said that even with high-tech equipment, it may have taken hours for the thieves to drill through the concrete. He said: ‘What they might have done is to bore several holes with a rig-based drill until they had made a space big enough to get through, rather than boring one hole and breaking through. It could have taken up to an hour per hole.’ Detective Chief Inspector Paul Johnson of the Flying Squad, speaks to journalists outside Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd today following last weekend's burglary in London . Police yesterday revealed the thieves used a Hilti DD 350 drill to get through the two-metre thick vault walls . During the raid the gang used an angle grinder and crowbars to force their way into 70 deposit boxes to steal the gems and cash inside. They then made their escape before employees arriving for work on Tuesday spotted the raid. Mr Johnson added: ‘The scene is chaotic. The vault is covered in dust and debris and the floor is strewn with discarded safety deposit boxes and numerous power tools, including an angle grinder, concrete drills and crowbars. ‘There is no sign of forced entry to the outside of the building. We are in the process of identifying the owners of the safety deposit boxes and contacting them to take statements and find out what has been stolen.’ He said his team had only just reached the vault because of the amount of debris at the scene. Mr Johnson added: ‘It’s got to be a slow, painstaking and methodical forensic process to get in there.’ Experts fear the thieves may have already smuggled the jewels out of the country and are planning to cut up the larger gems to make it easier to sell them on the black market. One jeweller who rents a deposit box said police have identified the owners of 30 boxes which had been broken into. Furious jewellery dealers today accused the manager of the safe deposit of 'gross negligence'. Pictured: Felix Stephens (left) and Gerald Landon (right)
When leaving a place of work, most people will usually avoid burning  bridges. Engineering an amicable exit is common protocol, even when the employee can't wait to get the hell out of there. But one disgruntled staff member at an anonymous firm decided to skip the pleasantries and pen an incredibly sarcastic resignation letter announcing their impending departure to bosses. A Reddit user wrote an incredibly sarcastic resignation letter to their boss . A Reddit user decided that it was a good idea to write a biting leaving note to their boss.It's not known exactly where the letter is from, but the writer is believed to be America since the American spelling of ‘apologize’ is used and the date is 4/24/15 which is the U.S. way of writing it. In the note, the Reddit user passive-aggressively vents their frustration and discontent with the company policies as well as the lack of emopion shown during recent events. Throughout the letter, the Reddit user repeatedly apologises for a number of unfortunate incidents - all of which seem to be out of their control. They apologise for the death of a step-mother, sickness and  subsequent doctor's appointments. The letter reads: 'I am sorry that my step-mother died so suddenly from cancer. I am sorry that I am not a robot and was emotionally affected by her passing and had to miss work. 'I am sorry that I got sick and had to miss work so that I didn't get anyone else sick. 'I am sorry I work 47.5 hours per week (without getting paid the overtime that I am legally owed) for the last 7 months, and thus have little choice but to schedule necessary doctor's appointments during school hours.' 'Clearly I am a terrible employee, and for that I apologize. I know you hate people telling you how to do your job, but I suggest you start looking for my replacement. Immediately.' Although posted with the caption 'two weeks notice', the defiant ending of the letter hints at a rather more immediate departure.

The savage animals tumbled down a snowy Iceland mountainside and crashed onto the rocky beach below during the vicious struggle. Wildlife photographer Einar Gudmann caught the violent encounter on camera. He had been sleeping in his warm shelter when he was suddenly woken by howling. A pair of Arctic foxes viciously fight to the death on the snow in a battle to claim a lone Vixen . The amazing scene was captured on camera by wildlife photographer Einar Gudmann, who was woken up by howling . The two foxes fought each other in bitter sub-zero temperatures after one of them had been copulating with a vixen . After emerging into the bitter sub-zero temperatures, he spotted a female and male fox copulating. But the pair weren't alone - a third Arctic fox lurked nearby. Without warning the single fox emerged and began to growl and howl at the pair. Wiggling free, the female ran for the hills while the two male foxes began to fight. Mr Gudmann said: 'The female's partner managed to grab and get a firm bite over the eye and under the jaw of the single one. A fox interrupts two others mating on a pebbly beach and decides to win over the vixen by fighting the other male . Squaring up: The two male foxes growl and bare their teeth at each other as the female turns her back on the tense situation .

The losing fox was not predicted to survive the night, having got no mercy from his opponent . The victorious fox makes its way back up the hill after the brief, but aggressive, fight . 'He used this to push the single one into the sea between the rocks. Splashes went bursting into all direction and moments later the single one was completely submerged and wet. 'Heavy and wet it was obvious at this moment that he had lost the fight. Now it was no longer a matter of fighting to kill, it was a matter of survival. 'He tried to run but got no mercy from his opponent. 'He finally managed to get into a dry area on the beach where they kept fighting. Heavily wounded and soaking wet he managed to run up the snowy hill but had trouble getting over the snow-bank at the top.' The snow is whipped into the air by strong winds as one of the foxes desperately seeks shelter . One of the male foxes looks directly at Mr Gudmann's camera as it trots through the snow . Meanwhile, the victorious fox shook off the shock of the brief yet aggressive fight and began a search of its female partner which had fled to the snowy mountainside. Mr Gudmann added: 'In the distance a wounded and vanquished arctic fox struggled the last steps up the snow-bank above the beach and started to hobble up the mountain. 'He had been beaten. The cold night would probably be his last one.'
Tim Sherwood has confirmed he will start Shay Given against Liverpool in the FA Cup semi-final at Wembley on Sunday, a day before the Irishman turns 39. Given has been selected each round of the competition, beginning under Paul Lambert, and Sherwood said he would keep faith with his deputy goalkeeper. Brad Guzan, Villa’s No 1, suffered heartbreak in 2010, when he was understudy to Brad Friedel but played every round of the League Cup – before being left out of the final against Manchester United by manager Martin O’Neill.

The 38-year-old has played in all four of Villa's FA Cup matches this season and has kept two clean-sheets . Villa manager Tim Sherwood confirmed Given will start on Sunday, a day before the Irishman turns 39 . But Sherwood said there would be no such turnaround this year, with Given lasting until the final if Villa make it there. ‘Shay plays. Absolutely,’ said Sherwood. ‘He’s done nothing wrong Shay, he’s a large part of the reason we’re in this semi-final. ‘The saves he made against Leicester were fantastic and at the right time. He trains fantastically well and he’s pushing Brad all the way for that No 1 spot.’ Sherwood watched his Villa side in training on Friday as they prepare for the weekend's crunch clash .

At least six men were arrested in California and Minnesota by the FBI on Sunday after a joint terrorism task force investigation into youths who traveled or tried to travel to Syria to join ISIS. A spokesman for the US Attorney's Office said the arrests were made in Minneapolis and San Diego but there is no threat to public safety. Spokesman Ben Petok did not give details about the charges and said more information would be released on Monday. Scroll down for video . Arrests were made Sunday in Minnesota and California after an investigation into youths traveling to join ISIS in Iraq and Syria (file picture) Three men who were arrested in Minneapolis (above) were already known to authorities, according to reports . Cross country: A Somali mother said one son was arrested in Minneapolis and the other was arrested in San Diego (above) At least three men who were arrested in the Twin Cities were already known to authorities, according to KMSP. The three men were stopped from boarding a plane to Istanbul with Hamza Ahmed, 19, at JFK Airport after riding on a Greyhound bus with him from Minneapolis to New York in November. Ahmed was indicted for lying to the FBI during a terrorism investigation, conspiring to provide material support to the ISIS and attempting to provide material support in February. He has pleaded not guilty. No public charges were filed against his companions and little information was released about them. An FBI affidavit said they are all between the ages of 19 and 20 and live in the Twin Cities. A Somali woman said one of her sons was arrested at her house in Minneapolis around noon and the other was arrested in San Diego, according to MPR News. She said she didn't know why more than 12 FBI agents and police officers searched her house and confiscated a tablet. The FBI made at least six arrests in Minneapolis and San Diego following a joint terrorism task force operation . The US Attorney's Office and the FBI will hold a news conference Monday to announce details about the joint terrorism task force operation. An FBI spokesman in San Diego referred questions to a spokesman in Minneapolis, who said Sunday he could not comment. Authorities say a handful of Minnesota residents have traveled to Syria to fight with militants within the last year. At least one Minnesotan has died while fighting for the Islamic State. Since 2007, more than 22 young Somali men have also traveled from Minnesota to Somalia to join the terrorist group al-Shabab. Four Minnesotans have already been charged in connection with supporting terror groups in Syria, including ISIS.
In the United States, women earn an average of 78 cents for every dollar that men make — and a new pop-up shop in Pennsylvania is using this blatant gender-biased wage gap in order to charge its female customers lower prices than its male visitors. Pittsburgh-based pop-up store, Less Than 100, has priced its entire stock to reflect the local gender pay gap, meaning that female customers are only charged 76 per cent of the retail price while men pay in full. More active protest than business venture, Less Than 100 is not-for-profit and aims to highlight the disparity in salaries between the sexes. Scroll down for video. Woman's worth: Elana Schlenker has opened a pop-up shop in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania where women are charged only 76 per cent as much as men in order to highlight the problem of wage inequality . 'It’s incredible how deeply unconscious biases still permeate the ways in which we perceive (and value) women versus men,' owner Elana Schlenker told Refinery29. 'I hope the shop’s pricing helps to underscore this inherent unfairness and to create space for people to consider why the wage gap still exists.’ Ms. Schlenker can afford the gender-conscious pricing because her shop isn't aiming to make money; all sales from the ceramics, textiles, publications, art prints, and stationery sole will go back to the female artists who made them. 'This is a small way that I can do something about [the pay gap], and I think many of the artists involved are coming from a similar place,' Ms. Schlenker added. Price adjustment: Less Than 100 sells ceramics, art, and textiles by female artists as a discount to female customers . In addition to adjusting its prices, Less Than 100 is also holding events promoting wage equality at the pop-up space, including one for April 14's Equal Pay Day, which represents how far into the year a woman must work to earn as much as her male counterpart did the previous year. Ms. Schlenker said she is concerned that women are undervalued in the workplace and underrepresented in executive positions and wants to draw attention to the problem through this venture, and added that she's been excited about how much support her shop has received. 'Everyone that's walked in, from women to men, has said "I love this idea",' she told WPIX. 'Women are worth what men are worth, of course, and just that community that's sprung up around this has been amazing.' She has also reached out to local organizations for grants to help maintain the pop-up shop, which will be open in Pittsburgh for the entire month of April. Ladies pay less: At the original location, women pay 76 per cent; in New Orleans this fall, women will pay 66 per cent, since women in Louisiana make even less compared to men than women in Pennsylvania . Fans of the idea who want to get in on the action but don't live in Pennsylvania can continue to check in on the organization's website, as Ms. Schlenker intends to travel with the shop, changing prices everywhere she goes to reflect the local pay gap. She will be re-opening the the store in New Orleans this fall, where prices for female shoppers will drop even more to 66 per cent of the original retail value, corresponding with Louisiana's pay cap. Male customers will continue to pay 100 per cent of the price for items like a $224 pitcher, which costs $195 for female customers in Pittsburgh, and a $120 Gamma Folk necklace, for which women this month are charged $92.
Professor Ninian Peckitt is accused of repeatedly punching a patient in the face to correct a fracture . A pioneering facial surgeon ‘repeatedly’ punched a patient in the head in an ‘extraordinary’ attempt to correct a fracture caused by an industrial accident, a medical tribunal has heard. Professor Ninian Peckitt, 63, claimed he had simply ‘digitally manipulated’ the patient’s face as part of hospital treatment, but witnesses said that in reality he had actually been hitting him, the tribunal was told. The world-renowned surgeon, who has lectured on the use of titanium implants to treat disfigured patients and has been published in academic texts, faces being struck off the medical register after being accused of failing three of his patients. A Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service hearing in Manchester was told a man referred to as Patient A had suffered ‘extensive injuries’ to the right side of his face in an industrial accident. He was admitted to Ipswich Hospital in February 2012 where Professor Peckitt was working as an honorary locum consultant in oral and maxillo-facial surgery since the previous month. Christopher Hamlet, representing the General Medical Council, told the hearing: ‘The case is not centred around the outcome, but the method of the surgery by way of the extraordinary allegation that he repeatedly punched the patient in the face.’ He added that Patient A had fallen out of bed which had further displaced his facial fractures. The hearing was told Professor Peckitt embarked on a ‘closed reduction’ procedure, in which a patient is given anaesthetic before the fractured bone is manually put back together without surgery, and a cast or splint applied. Mr Peckitt was working as an honorary locum at Ipswich Hospital in Suffolk at the time of the alleged incident in February 2012. A medical tribunal will decide whether he should be struck off the register . Professor Peckitt, formerly of Doncaster, later described the procedure as one in which the patient’s face had been ‘digitally manipulated as best they could be achieved’, the hearing heard. It was also alleged he treated Patient A without seeking advice from colleagues. He quit his post at the hospital days later. He was also alleged to have failed to check the medical records of a second patient, Patient B, which led to him attempting an unnecessary procedure on her, and to have treated another, Patient C, for a complex facial deformity without seeking the advice of another surgeon. Professor Peckitt, who is now working in Dubai, has submitted emails in which he ‘emphatically denies’ the allegations, and claims he has been ‘victimised’. ‘In relation to Patient A, he says they simply didn’t see any punching,’ Mr Hamlet said. Dr Timothy Mellor, an expert called for the GMC, prepared a report. ‘He confirmed it is entirely inappropriate to try to reduce a fracture with external force alone or whether the punch was additional manipulation – there is no basis you can reduce a fracture in that nature,’ Mr Hamlet said. The hearing continues.
A gel made from patients' own blood could help heal burns more quickly - and stop wounds getting worse. The gel contains platelet-rich plasma (PRP) - a concentrated mix of substances in the blood that play a role in healing. It is made by taking a small amount of blood from a patient's arm (amounts vary depending on wound size, but typically no more than a couple of tablespoons) and then processing it in a machine that spins the blood at high speed until it separates into its various components. Blood is largely made up of a clear yellowish liquid, called plasma, but it also contains small, solid compounds - red cells, white cells and platelets. The platelets are important for clotting, but they also contain hundreds of proteins called growth factors that are important for healing. U.S. researchers are testing the new gel it as a dressing for burns . Spinning the blood leaves behind the plasma and the platelets but in higher concentration - up to ten times greater than usual. Platelet-rich plasma is sometimes used to treat tendon injuries and is also used in some cosmetic procedures that claim injecting it into the face can rejuvenate skin - nicknamed the 'vampire facelift'. U.S. researchers are testing it as a dressing for burns. As well as boosting healing, it is thought the gel, known as Magellan Bio-Bandage, will act as a barrier against infection. The researchers also hope using platelet-rich plasma will address a common problem with burns, which is that they often continue to get worse hours or even days after the original injury. This can mean a burn that had initially caused damage to the outer layer of skin (the epidermis) and the underlying tissue containing the hair follicles and sweat glands and smaller blood vessels (dermis) can become a 'full-thickness' burn. Platelet-rich plasma is sometimes used to treat tendon injuries and for cosmetic procedures . This is where there is damage to the third and final layer of skin - the subcutis, which contains larger blood vessels and nerves, and regulates the temperature of the skin and body. Full-thickness burns usually require extensive treatment, including skin grafts. It's hoped the platelet-rich plasma will allow the wound to start to heal before it can deteriorate. The U.S. trial uses a new blood-spinning machine that is designed to be used at a patient's bedside, collecting it in a syringe ready for immediate use as a gel. Previous research suggests that the high concentration of growth factors in the platelet-rich plasma helps stimulate growth of new blood vessels and skin tissue. It's also suggested that it reduces pain, though it's not clear why. For the latest study, at the University of Utah and other burns centres, about 40 patients will have up to 18ml of the platelet-rich plasma (about three teaspoons) applied on to a partial-thickness burn within 72 hours of the initial injury. The quantities used may vary depending on the size of the injury. Commenting on the treatment, Dr Bav Shergill, consultant dermatologist at Queen Victoria Hospital, East Grinstead, said: 'This is emerging technology that is causing a great deal of excitement. Platelet-rich plasma is already being used by orthopaedic surgeons with some amazing successes. 'We are all looking for a method to collect and purify a high concentration of these effective molecules to improve repair in skin disorders. I look forward to large-scale trials of PRP showing similar results.' Meanwhile, a combination of platelet-rich plasma and stem cells is being tested as a treatment for knee arthritis. Researchers at the Post Graduate Institute of Medicine in Chandigarh, India, believe injections of both substances will help regenerate worn-out cartilage, the tissues that cushions the joint. Stem cells have the ability to turn into different cell types. About 40 patients will be given injections of either stem cells and platelet-rich plasma or just platelet-rich plasma and the results compared.
While Rory McIlroy is no stranger to pumping iron, the world's No 1 golfer will need more than a few extra sessions in the gym to get close to matching American teenager Brad Dalke. McIlroy knew he was beaten even before he  took the strain for an arm wrestle with the ripped high schooler who made short work of a strength test against the Northern Irishman. Dalke posted a video of the light-hearted encounter on his Twitter page with the note, 'Sorry Rory.' 'Look at this ... No chance,' Rory McIlroy says as he prepares to arm wrestle 17-year-old Brad Dalke . Dalke makes short work of the strength test against the world No 1 golfer who was a guest at a junior event . McIlroy is no match for Dalke, the teenager who will join Oklahoma University in the autumn . McIlroy had run a clinic and offered some inspirational words to players on Friday at a junior invitational at the Sage Valley Golf Club in Graniteville, South Carolina, sponsored by Nike. There he met Dalke and the pair agreed to an arm wrestle. As they took a knee, with elbows on a table as is customary, McIlroy couldn't help but be impressed by the 17-year-old's biceps. 'Look at this... no chance,' McIlroy laughed while poking Dalke's arm. 'I shouldn't be a golfer,' Dalke, who listed 'working out' among his interests on his 2014 Junior US Ryder Cup team profile, joked back. Oklahoma University hopes he wasn't serious having had the prodigy lined up via a verbal agreement to play for them since he was just 12 years old. McIlroy, whose long game is one of the best in golf, pumps iron in the gym . The weights work in the gym didn't help McIlroy when he came face-to-face with Dalke . Schooling the world's best golfer in an arm wrestle will do his bragging rights no harm when he arrives on campus to end the institution's five-year wait for him to come of age this year. Dalke will join the Sooners after graduating a year early from high school, having completed extra classes since he was a freshman (the equivalent of year nine in the UK). He told Golf Week last year that it was a 'dream come true' when he was told he'd be able to ditch move into college early. 'It's the only place I wanted to go,' Dalke said. - 2008 Drive, Chip and Putt National Champion . - US Kids World Champion in 2010 . - Committed verbally to Oklahoma University at the age of 12. - Won the 2011 AJGA Thunderbird International Junior. - American Junior Golf Association First Team All-American in 2011, 2012 and 2013 . - Member of the USA team that won a fourth successive Junior Ryder Cup in 2014 at Blairgowrie Golf Club. - Tied for third in the 2014 Junior PGA Championship . - Winner of the 2013 PING Invitational . - Equalled Tiger Woods’ Wyndham Cup appearances record playing from 2011 to 2014 . - Moved from home in McKinney, Texas, to Hobart, Oklahoma, where less credits are required to graduate high school. - Has a 4.0 grade point average and will begin university at Oklahoma a year early after picking up extra credits since he was a freshman. Dalke is a talented junior golfer and was a member of Team USA when they won the 2014 Junior Ryder Cup . Dalke celebrates the USA's fourth successive Junior Ryder Cup win Blairgowrie Golf Club . Dalke committed to Oklahoma University at age 12 and has finished high school a year early to join them . Getting one over one of the greats of the game could also give Dalke a confidence boost that he's been in need of on the course after hitting a disappointing 85 in the first round at Sage Valley. He shared his frustration with his Twitter following of less than 2,000, a number that is sure to grow. 'Really bad day of golf today. Can't wait to get through this slump, and even though it's tough to see now, I know I'll be stronger in the end,' he posted. He was right. The next day he shot a much-improved 72 and wrote: 'Way better day today. Shot a 72. Felt like a whole different person out there.'
A man, 21, allegedly forced a tearful 15-year-old girl into his car on Saturday and screamed, 'you will never see your parents again!' in attempt to force her to be his teen bride. Kong Meng Xiong, 21, of St. Paul, Minnesota has been charged with kidnapping, third-degree criminal sexual conduct and false imprisonment. The Star Tribune reports that the girl's family reported the kidnapping on Sunday and that they opposed to their daughter marrying Xiong, whom she was dating, because of their age differences. Alleged kidnapper: Kong Meng Xiong, 21, of St.Paul, Minnesota has been arrested after he allegedly tried to force his 15-year-old girlfriend to be his traditional Hmong bride . Xiong and his parents say they wanted the girl and Xiong to marry in the Hmong tradition. The girl, who has not been identified because she is a minor, told police that Xiong was her 'boyfriend' and that they got into a physical argument over the prospect of marriage on Saturday night. Xiong allegedly threw the girl's iPad against a wall at her family's home and then ripped her sweatpants as he dragged her into his car. Her parents were not home at the time. The girl told police that she managed to escape but that Xiong took hold of her a second time, forced her into his car, and took her to his family's home. When the girl's parents returned home from work at around noon on Sunday, they learned of the kidnapping from their oldest son. The girl's parents called Xiong's parents and demanded that they give them their daughter back. The girl's older brother later drove to the Xiong's home where they willingly let the girl go home. The girl told police that she and Xiong had been 'dating' in January and first had sex when she was just 14-years-old. The victim's father told police that Xiong asked him to marry his daughter on multiple occasions but that he said no because of their large age difference. Xiong admitted to kidnapping the girl and said that she tried to escape from him on Highway 26. This is not Xiong's first brush with the law. In 2009 Xiong was tried in juvenile court or sexually assaulting a 13-year-old girl when he was 15. He pleaded guilty. Ramsey County Attorney John Choi said about the case, 'This is a very disturbing case involving the victimization of a 15-year-old girl that cannot be tolerated in our community. 'Women and girls are not property, they are human beings who have every right to be free from violence and to live according to how they choose for themselves. 'We allege that the defendant has sexually exploited a minor who cannot legally consent to sex, and has taken violent actions to kidnap and hold the victim against her will.' According to Hmongculture.net, the Hmong are an ethnic group that come from Laos, Thailand, Vietnam, and Laos. In the late 1980s many Hmong people came to the United States after being sponsored by the Lutheran church. The majority relocated to St. Paul, Minnesota and Fresno, California. In traditional Hmong marriages the man generally asks permission from the girl's family to wed her. If that method fails, there is a tradition of 'bride-napping' in Hmong culture in which the man may literally drag his bride to his house when her parents are not home. If the girl does not accept a gift from her sometimes forceful suitor then she may go back to her family, says Ahmongwoman.com .
Sussex head coach Mark Robinson has warned that wicketkeeper Matt Prior remains 'pretty much out indefinitely' as his recovery from an achilles injury continues. Prior, 33, was badly affected by the problem last summer, eventually losing his England place to Jos Buttler, and has not played since July. He took a break to focus on rehabilitation and admitted 'I could have played my last game (for England)' - and Robinson's prognosis offers no further encouragement. Matt Prior has not played since July, when he lost his England place because of an achilles injury . Prior, seen here celebrating the 2013 Ashes victory with captain Alastair Cook, is out 'indefinitely' 'He's out pretty much indefinitely at the moment. He's still recovering from an Achilles injury which he did playing for England,' Robinson told Sky Sports News HQ. 'It's a blow for him and a blow for us. He's working hard on his rehab. He's in most days of the week. Sometimes it's a bit soul-destroying. As everybody knows, it's been a long injury. 'We feel for him as a cricketer - he's just itching to get playing again - and for the club too, because to have your wicketkeeper batting in the top five would have been such a bonus for us.' Prior admitted he may never play Test cricket for England again after his injury last summer .
It's no secret celebrities spend thousands upon thousands of dollars on maintaining their looks. From bloody 'vampire facials' to placenta serums and of course plastic surgery - the fountain of youth runs deep. But an app is now trying to cut through all the cosmetics to determine exactly how old a person looks based on a picture. The website, called  How old do I look, it allows people to analyse any image found on Bing, Microsoft's search engine, or upload their own. It even allows users to search for celebrities - and see what Microsoft thinks their real ages are. Scroll down for video . Looking good: The app, by Microsoft, believed that 69-year-old Helen Mirren - lauded for her youthful appearance and character - was actually 55 . The site was able to accurately guess Kim Kardashian's age as 34, but thought 37-year-old Kanye West was actually 38 - while a woman in the background of the image was deemed to be just six-years-old . On-point: Modern Family star Sofia Vergara apparently looks 13 years younger than 42, while President Barrack Obama looks as he is - 53 .

Time to change: Business mogul Jack Welch has called for an end to the college hierarchy that has caused education to become cripplingly expensive . Business mogul Jack Welch has called for an end to the college hierarchy that has caused higher education to become cripplingly expensive. Speaking to DailyMail.com CEO Jon Steinberg, the former head of General Electric insisted that it's time to cut out expensive and needless middle management. He said: 'If you look at education today there are deans, there are associate deans, there are assistants to the associate deans. There's hierarchy beyond belief. 'Why should these lazy professors hang out getting fat on money while kids are going broke graduating? 'It's dumb, it's stupid, and it has to be broken.' Welch warned that this increase in middle management is driving up the cost of higher education, which is now failing to give students value for the amount of money they are forced to shell out. He told Steinberg that he is now dedicated to taking education in a new direction as executive of the Jack Welch Management Institute (JWMI), which currently has over 900 students and is growing. He said: 'At JWMI one thing is true - and this will be a big change for education - we think: 'Who is our customer?' The student is our customer. 'We have no tenure. We will remove faculty if the students call for it. 'They know when they're getting value and when they're not. They're great consumers and they give us voice' 'If we've got jerks that aren't giving them what they want, we''l have a chat with them once, and the second time they won't be there. They won't be in the next class.' The business mogul and his wife, business journalist and author Suzy Welch, were speaking at an Answers to Correspondents event at the New York's Core Club hosted by DailyMail.com and JWMI. During the intimate conversation, Welch claimed that JWMI could provide a model for what the future of graduate education can be. 'We're seeing lives change,' he said. 'It's amazing how we're changing lives with some very basic steps and an economically sound deal for us and for them.' Jack Welch (right) and his wife, business journalist and author Suzy Welch (center), were speaking with DilyMail.com CEO Jon Steinberg at an Answers to Correspondents event at the New York's Core Club . Following the release of their new book The Real-Life MBA: Your No-BS Guide to Winning the Game, Building a Team, and Growing Your Career, the couple discussed how real-world business scenarios should be used in education. Suzy Welch said: 'What's happening in business education in our school are these team-based projects that are more simulation of business troubles and business challenges, and that's better.' She pointed out that at many schools business education is being taught by academics, who lack real-world experience at a management level. 'Most of them haven't managed a thing,' she added. 'They're sitting there talking to you about leadership and they've not led a person. 'At our school, 90 per cent of the faculty are also business leaders. They are business executives who all have done PhDs. 'Anything that can be more real world really helps.'
Arnold Schwarzenegger has unleashed a tirade against Indiana's polarizing Religious Freedom Restoration Act, saying the new laws are 'distracting and divisive' for the Republican Party. While the legislation has sparked a nationwide outcry, with many claiming it legalizes discrimination against lesbians and gays and causing boycotts of the state, the actor and former California governor has a different take on the controversy. Writing an op-ed for The Washington Post, Schwarzenegger says he believes the defining problem is that Republicans are focusing on the wrong issues, in a move that will only hurt the GOP and further alienate voters. He wrote in the piece Friday: 'As an American, I’m incredibly concerned about what happened in Indiana this week and the threat of similar laws being passed in other states. '(But) as a Republican, I’m furious.' Blast: Former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger became the latest celebrity to speak out against Indiana’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act, calling it a 'distracting' law that only hurts the Republican Party . Schwarzenegger continued: 'I know plenty of Republicans who are sensible and driven to solve problems for America … This message isn’t for them … It is for Republicans who choose the politics of division over policies that improve the lives of all of us. 'It is for Republicans who have decided to neglect the next generation of voters. It is for Republicans who are fighting for laws that fly in the face of equality and freedom. 'If we want our party to grow and last, we must be focused on real solutions to problems Americans are facing. 'But distracting, divisive laws like the one Indiana passed aren't just bad for the country, they’re also bad for our party. 'Polls show that laws like this are not supported by independents, women, minorities or Americans between 18 and 29. Outcry: Protesters hold signs protesting Indiana's controversial Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which has made the state the target of a boycott by businesses, local governments and individuals across the US . Angered: Demonstrators gather in Indianapolis to protest a controversial religious freedom bill recently signed by Indiana Governor Mike Pence during a rally last weekend . March: Thousands of opponents of Indiana Senate Bill 101, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, gather for a protest on the lawn of the Indiana State House on March 28 . 'If the Republican Party wants the next generation of voters to listen to our ideas and solutions to real problems, we must be an inclusive and open party, not a party of divisions. 'We must be the party of limited government, not the party that legislates love. 'We must be the party that stands for equality and against discrimination in any form.' Schwarzenegger was the Governor of California between 2003 and 2011. In 2008 he opposed California’s controversial Prop 8 in favor of LGBT rights. However the bill, which made gay marriage illegal in California, was still passed while he was governor. The Religious Freedom Restoration Act, brought in by Indiana Governor Mike Pence, with a near-identical bill brought in in Arkansas, were supposed to satisfy evangelicals by 'upholding religious freedom', but subsequently sparked boycotts of both states. The Republican governors of both states signed off Thursday on changes approved by the legislatures aimed at clarifying the intent behind the legislation. To a large extent, the measures were modeled after a federal law enacted in 1993 with broad bipartisan support. But critics of the new measures said they were designed with a different motive — to shield businesses and individuals who do not want to serve gays and lesbians, such as florists or caterers who might be hired for a same-sex wedding.
Consumers could soon have to pay goods and services tax (GST) on their movie and music downloads in a government moves to reel in extra billions of dollars in revenue. Treasurer Joe Hockey said the states had agreed to work toward applying the 10 per cent GST to movies and music downloaded from streaming services such as Netflix and Apple. The changes may also affect consumers buying any products for less than $1,000 online from overseas, thus affecting companies such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon and eBay. But consumer advocacy group Choice says tech-savvy Australian consumers might be able to avoid the tax by concealing their location through virtual private networks, which make them appear to be outside the country. Scroll down for video . Australian movie and music downloaders could soon be slapped with a 10 per cent tax in a move that could reel in billions of additional GST revenue for the federal government . Choice argues that the government should instead be tackling the exorbitant domestic costs of TV shows, music and movies, and difficulties accessing them. Netflix subscription: 90c increase to $9.90 . Standard iTunes song: 22c increase to $2.41 . Google Play movie: 60c increase to $6.60 . Standard Amazon song: 13c increase to $1.42 . Adobe Creative Cloud subscription: 99c increase to $10.99 . 'We need to make it easier ... in order to encourage greater competition,' Choice chief executive Alan Kirkland told ABC radio on Friday. Netflix has indicated that it would increase the cost of its service in line with any new laws and regulations. 'We pay taxes as required under local and national law,' a spokesperson from Netflix US head office said. With an $8.99 per month fee for its service, Netflix customers would only have to pay at least an extra 90c while song downloaders would pay an additional 22c for $2.19 track on iTunes. Federal Treasurer Joe Hockey announced that each states and territories' treasurer had agreed to the tax, which he declared was an 'integrity measures for the tax base, not the broadening of the GST or an increase of the GST' With an $8.99 per month fee for its service, Netflix customers would only have to pay an extra approximate 90c while song downloaders would pay an additional 22c for $2.19 track on iTunes . Federal Treasurer Joe Hockey announced that each states and territories' treasurer had agreed to the tax, which he declared was an 'integrity measures for the tax base, not the broadening of the GST or an increase of the GST'. 'The states agreed in principle that we should move in that regard. I have offered to work as quickly as possible with them to introduce legislation to address that in relation to intangibles,' Mr Hockey said, according to the Financial Review. It comes after News Corp Australia chief executive Julian Clarke slammed the foreign companies' ability to avoid paying tax, consequently leading to an unlevelled playing field in the advertising market. Mr Clarke implored the government to 'fix that problem' during a Senate Standing Committees on Economics in which he argued against the disadvantage of competing against overseas companies with a lower operating cost.

Theo Walcott understands just how difficult it is now to hold down a place in the Arsenal side, who he says have been the 'best team in Europe' this year and could lift the title next season if everyone stays fit. The Gunners' slim hopes of overhauling Chelsea's 10-point lead at the top of the Barclays Premier League were all but extinguished following a goalless draw at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday. Walcott watched on from the bench again before a late substitute appearance, with the forward's last club start having been back in March. Theo Walcott believes Arsenal have been the 'best team in Europe' in the second half of the season . Arsenal had earned eight successive Premier League victories before the 0-0 draw against Chelsea . The 26-year-old - who recovered from a serious knee injury last season, but has yet to agree a new long-term deal - feels such strength in depth can only be positive for the squad, if sometimes frustrating for individuals. Fellow England internationals Danny Welbeck, Jack Wilshere and Kieran Gibbs also did not make the first XI against Chelsea. 'There is a lot of competition for places so everyone seems to lift a gear and play extremely well. It makes it a bit more difficult for people to get into the team,' Walcott said, quoted on the club's official website, www.arsenal.com. 'I think, especially this season, not many people thought we would be challenging for the Premier League. 'In this calendar year, we have been the best team in Europe. 'It is the strongest the squad has been and everyone is staying fit as well. The English midfielder (left) has struggled to maintain a first team place under Arsene Wenger this season . 'There aren't many injuries in the squad, which is important. If we had an injury-free season, I think we could lift the title.' Arsenal head to Hull on Bank Holiday Monday looking to keep pressure on Manchester City in the race for second place, and with it automatic qualification for next season's Champions League. Captain Mikel Arteta is set to step up his training this week after an ankle problem hampered recovery from a calf injury, while midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is another continuing rehabilitation from an inflamed groin which has seen him out since the FA Cup win at Manchester United last month.
Hillary Clinton is laughing in the face of the accepted retirement age - currently 65 both in the UK and the US - by aiming to become the leader of the Free World just months before her 70th birthday. If the former U.S. Secretary of State reaches her goal and is sworn in as the 44th President of the United States in January 2017, then she will not only be the country's first female president but also the second oldest, behind Ronald Reagan, ever to open the doors to the White House. Clinton certainly seems to be relishing the life experience that her advancing years have given her. Age is nothing but a number: Hillary Clinton who has launched her campaign to be US president (pictured above, speaking at the Women in the World Conference on April 23) will be 69 when she takes office if successful . Celebrating her advancing years: A black-and-white photograph showing Hillary as a toddler just after the end of the Second World War has been posted on her Twitter feed . A black-and-white image posted on her Twitter account this weekend showed  a very young Clinton pointing at the camera, accompanied by the phrase 'Hillary's counting on you', echoing Lord Kitchener's famous First World War slogan: 'Your country needs you'. It appears the presidential candidate is very much celebrating her age: the image itself would have been shot while Clinton was a toddler just after the end of the Second World War. Elsewhere, Clinton's newfound Grandmother status - her daughter Chelsea gave birth to a daughter, Charlotte, with husband Marc Mezvinsky in September last year - has seen her able to relate to a whole new section of the voting public. Doting...but could Hillary's recent status as a grandmother be a powerful tool in her bid to win votes? Last week, the politician, currently 67, posted the hashtag #GrandmothersKnowBest to her Twitter feed . The hashtag #GrandmothersKnowBest used on Hillary's Twitter page has attracted other grandmothers to post their own posts using it . In a recent Twitter posting promoting vaccines for children, Clinton ended the appeal with the hashtag #GrandmothersKnowBest, which has since seen a stream of grannies from across the globe tweeting their own posts using the hashtag. Clinton is by no means the only high-profile woman refusing to change gear as she gets older; there are a raft of successful female figures continuing to put their foot on the gas and  power their way into the last quarter of their lives. Below, we've outlined some of the world's most influential women whose careers - in everything from fashion to politics - are still flying high after retirement age. ANNA WINTOUR . AGE: 65 . The biggest name in the fashion industry, Anna Wintour has managed to fly high well into her seventh decade despite working in what is regularly deemed the most superficial of industries. Although her Vogue U.S. Editorship has looked a little wobbly over the decades, as the names of new, younger faces have been mooted as possible replacements, Wintour is still very much at the top of the fashion tree. The most powerful woman in fashion: Vogue US Editor Anna Wintour, pictured here between David Beckham (left with daughter Harper) and James Corden (right) in LA on April 16 remains ever influential . Said to be the muse for hit film The Devil Wears Prada, mother-of-two Wintour can be assured of a front row seat at whichever catwalk show she chooses. Celebrity fans include the Beckhams, Roger Federer (the feeling is very much mutual) and Kate Moss. Two years ago, she was named artistic director for the entire Condé Nast publishing empire. DAME JUDI DENCH . AGE: 80 . Long established as a national treasure, Dame Judi Dench will turn 81 in December this year. With a gilded career that stretches six decades behind her, Dench has been vocal about her dislike of the ageing process, saying to U.S. magazine People: 'There’s nothing good about being my age.' She continued: 'Someone said to me, "You have such a wealth of knowledge," and I just said "I’d rather be young and know nothing, actually." Bugger the wealth of knowledge.' Despite failing sight which has left her unable to travel alone, the actress is showing no signs of retiring; her latest film The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel has just been released in America. Life begins at 80? Famous octogenarians Judi Dench (left) and baking star Mary Berry (right) have both seen their careers prosper in the twilight of their lives . MARY BERRY . AGE: 80 . Perhaps the key to the longevity of one of the country's most famous bakers is her energy. Slim, sharp and sprightly, Mary Berry has seen her career flourish through the generations with the BBC's Great British Bake Off programme taking her profile to new levels. Born in 1935, Berry has seen every food trend come and go but continues to stay current; with a knack for gently advising younger contestants on the show how best to improve their cakes without leaving them too dejected. Her colourful wardrobe has been copied by women much younger than her 80 years and 181,000 people adore her on Facebook. With spin-off shows planned including Junior Bake Off and regular television and radio appearances, plus a new book, Berry is busier than ever. DIANE VON FURSTENBERG . AGE: 68 . The Belgian-born designer behind the iconic wrap dress currently has 85 shops worldwide and has held the position of president of the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) since 2006. A supporter of Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign, Von Furstenberg has spoken about her own views on women in the workplace, saying: 'I never really felt the glass ceiling in fashion; I always felt my being a woman as a strength and as a gift.' The mother and grandmother continues to hold the United Nations DVF awards, which celebrates the achievements of women and said in her 2014 memoir, The Woman I Wanted to be: 'I cannot pretend that I am younger than I am, and truly I feel that I have lived so fully that I should be twice my age.' Fashion designer Diane Von Furstenberg, 68 (left),  has been open about her age, saying 'I feel that I have lived so fully that I should be twice my age' while Miuccia Prada, 65, who owns the famous Italian Prada label, has spoken of her desire to get into politics... MIUCCIA PRADA . AGE: 65 . When you run a global fashion empire, you needn't worry about collecting your pension but Miuccia Prada's career  continues to accelerate. Named the world's 75th most powerful woman in 2014 by Forbes, Prada the brand is worth an estimated $11.1 billion and Miuccia remains one of the highest-paid women in the industry. Joining the family leather handbag business in 1978, she quickly took control and oversaw the brand as it became a global fashion player in the late eighties. She has described the fast-paced fashion industry as like working 'on waves which break really quickly.' Although the Italian designer hasn't been officially involved in politics, it is a passion that she could yet develop. She said in 2011: 'Politics have always been a little of my passion. And now I [could] use my work as a tool to do things other than fashion.' AUNG SAN SUU KYI . AGE: 69 . Nobel peace prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi became famous the world over for her 21-year incarceration in Burma. When her house arrest ended in November 2010, she went on to stand for parliament in the country, winning a landslide victory. Inspiring: Hillary and former Burmese political prisoner Aung San Suu Kyi, 69, have both been prolific in their respective political arenas and show no signs of slowing as they approach their eighth decade . In June 2013, the former political prisoner announced that her political desires still burned strongly and that she wanted to run for the Myanmar presidency in 2015. Without the approval of at least one military legislator, it is, however, likely to remain just an ambition. MARGARET CHAN . AGE: 67 . By the time Dr Margaret Chan steps down from her role as Director General of the World Health Organisation in 2017, she will have served ten years in one of the most influential positions in health. Originally from China, Dr Chan was appointed Director of Health of Hong Kong before being elevated to the top position for the WHO in 2006. Dr Chan has had to manage responses to global panics such as SARS, bird flu and Ebola. Forbes lists her as the 30th most powerful woman in the world. Leading the way in the world of health: In the UK Professor Dame Sally Davies, 65, (left) is the Chief Medical Officer while (right) Margaret Chan, 67, has been in charge of the World Health Organisation since 2006 . SALLY DAVIES . AGE: 65 . Birmingham-born Professor Dame Sally Davies is the UK's Chief Medical Officer and can be seen advising the government on everything from three-parent families to the ebola crisis and obesity. A haematologist by trade, she was charged with developing the National Institute for Health Research in 2006, with a £1billion budget. The secret to keeping on top of such a stressful job? Not reaching for the bottle. Dame Sally told the Times in 2014: 'Even if it’s 7 or 8pm, I don’t go for the glass of alcohol, I go for a cup of tea and that solves my need for something to drink to unwind.' NANCY PELOSI . AGE: 75 . Currently the highest ranking female politician in U.S. history, Democrat Nancy Pelosi served as the 60th Speaker of the United States House of Representatives from 2007 to 2011. Nancy Pelosi, 75, remains the highest ranking female politician in American history . The Italian-American has just turned 75 and is the current minority leader of the House of Representatives. Her Twitter profile, for which she has nearly 600,000 followers, describes her as: 'Democratic Leader, focused on strengthening America's middle class and creating jobs; mother, grandmother, dark chocolate connoisseur.' Pelosi posts daily on the social media site. DILMA ROUSSEFF . AGE: 67 . The 36th president of Brazil, Dilma  Rousseff, knows very much how Hillary Clinton might be feeling at the start of her election campaign. Rousseff is the South American country's first female president. Political big hitter Dilma Rousseff, 67, became the first female president of Brazil in 2010 . Now in her second term, Rousseff was originally elected in 2010 and re-elected in 2014, narrowly beating her nearest rival Aécio Neves. The daughter of a Bulgarian immigrant may have broken the glass ceiling that Clinton has famously referred to but her popularity isn't assured; a corruption scandal at Petrobras, the state-run oil company, has seen activist groups calling for her to be impeached.
Tottenham head coach Mauricio Pochettino is unsure whether a planned boycott by Newcastle fans will prove a help or hindrance to his side this weekend. This season, like so many in recent years, has been a frustrating one at St James' Park and that has led some fans to take action when Spurs arrive on Sunday. A number of supporters plan to boycott the televised game in protest against owner Mike Ashley, which is likely to lead to a peculiar atmosphere in the north east. Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino (right) is in an upbeat mood ahead of the trip to Newcastle . Newcastle fans are staging a mass protest against the current regime at St James' Park . It will certainly make it an interesting test for Pochettino's side as they look to recover from some disappointing recent results of their own. 'You never know because sometimes the effect on the players and team maybe is positive,' the Spurs boss said. 'Maybe sometimes the players are scared and run more than all season. 'Or maybe it is a very negative atmosphere and they feel under pressure and don't show their face. 'You never know in football how it can affect all the decisions around the team. For that it is difficult to guess what will happen on Sunday.' On paper, this looks a good opportunity for Spurs to make amends for the goalless draw at Burnley and home defeat to Aston Villa. Christian Benteke scored the winner for Aston Villa to leave Spurs' season in danger of fizzling out . The fact Pochettino's predecessor Tim Sherwood oversaw the latter's victory made it all the more frustrating, yet the Spurs boss was in a surprisingly upbeat mood ahead of the trip to St James' Park. 'I think that football is football and I am a person who has spent all my life in football as player, manager and head coach,' he said. 'I accept in football there are good and bad moments, but one thing important is to keep your balance and a good mood. 'We always want to win and we are ambitious, but always we need to have a very good mood. 'We need to have patience, we need to work hard, we have to have our minds on the players and we need to have very good energy to repeat some of the performances this season.' Pochettino will come up against his countryman Jonas Guiterrez following his recovery from cancer . This weekend's match against Newcastle will also see Pochettino come up against a countryman who has made many a headline of late. Former Argentina international Jonas Gutierrez's recovery following a battle with cancer and his return to top-flight football has inspired many. 'I am very happy for him,' Pochettino said. 'When he went in the game against Liverpool, he got a good ovation and it was good to see him playing football. 'This is real life. Sometimes we worry about a lot of things and results, but this is real life when you have the problems that he has. 'For me, I am very happy to see him come back to football.'
Nico Rosberg fears the threat from Ferrari in this weekend's Bahrain Grand Prix, describing their pace as 'dangerous' and 'worrying'. Following Friday practice, in particular the evening session under the lights at the Bahrain International Circuit, Mercedes appeared comfortable. Rosberg topped the timesheet with a lap of one minute 34.647secs, finishing 0.115secs quicker than team-mate Lewis Hamilton after the reigning champion locked up in the second sector, costing him four tenths of a second. Nico Rosberg has admitted he's wary of the threat rivals Ferrari pose ahead of Sunday's Bahrain Grand Prix . The Mercedes driver was complimentary of Ferrari and described their pace as 'dangerous' and 'worrying' Ferrari duo Kimi Raikkonen and Sebastian Vettel finished third and fourth quickest, just over half a second adrift of Rosberg. Yet the 29-year-old German, who trails Hamilton by 17 points in the drivers' standings, is deeply concerned by Ferrari from what he witnessed over the course of the two 90-minute sessions. 'We are very quick on one lap again, and Ferrari are very dangerous on the long run,' said Rosberg. 'They have serious pace, which is very worrying. It looks like they are a genuine threat. 'In qualifying we are much quicker, but in the race they are quick. 'Tyre wise, it is pretty straightforward, with both tyres (the soft and medium-compound Pirellis) quite robust. It is just the absolute pace which is important.' Rosberg (left) trails team-mate Lewis Hamilton by 17 points in the drivers' standings ahead of Sunday's race . Barring mistakes it appears another Mercedes front-row lock-out is likely, with the Ferrari's occupying the second row, and from there a battle with strategy and pace. Hamilton has also expressed concerns about Ferrari as he said: 'They are going to be very close. They look very good, from what I can see, in the long run. 'The crucial part is we know we have speed in a qualifying lap, so it's more the speed on the race runs. 'That's an area we're really trying to work on, but other than that the car has been feeling very good, I'm really happy with it.' But the 29-year-old topped the timesheet with a lap of one minute 34.647secs during Friday practice . Vettel, 13 points adrift of Hamilton, endured a disruptive day as a loss of power compromised FP1, whilst a collision with Sergio Perez in his Force India hampered FP2. McLaren's Jenson Button also suffered a wretched day with technical issues in both sessions, resulting in a lack of running that left him down in 19th position, 4.5 seconds behind Rosberg and sandwiched between Manor duo Will Stevens and Roberto Merhi. Saturday could be problematic for all, though, as a sandstorm has been forecast to hit the area at some point during the day.
Ryanair passengers travelling to Edinburgh and Zadar, Croatia were delayed for hours after two of the budget airline’s planes clipped wings at Dublin Airport this morning. Photos snapped by travellers show the tip of a winglet dangling by a thread after clipping the other plane - and it's the second time in six months two Ryanair planes have collided at Ireland's busiest airport. Passengers escaped injury when the planes collided as they taxied to a runway shortly before 8am, but the incident caused disruption for hundreds of travellers. Passengers snapped photos of the damaged winglet after two Ryanair planes collided at Dublin Airport . Passengers escaped injury after two Ryanair planes clipped wings while taxiing to a runway at Dublin Airport . Passenger Shannen Murphy, who was seated on the Edinburgh-bound plane which lost part of its winglet, told MailOnline Travel: ‘We were just about to approach the runway and there was another Ryanair plane quite close, but I thought maybe it had broken down or something. ‘And then next of all there was a jerk in the plane, which felt like we had gone over a really big pothole.’ Moments later the pilot announced over the tannoy that there had been ‘an incident’ with another plane and passengers would have to return to the terminal. Shannen said passengers were stuck on the plane for up to 90 minutes, as they waited for buses to arrive, and they arrived in Edinburgh about three hours behind schedule. ‘As soon as we were off [the bus] we were taken straight to a new plane and within 30 minutes we were up in the air.’ One of the Ryanair planes' winglets was left dangling after the collision on a taxiway at Dublin Airport . Emergency services attended the scene of the collision as a precaution. Passengers on board both planes were taken back to the terminal by bus and put on replacement aircraft to continue their journeys to Scotland and Croatia. The Boeing 737s involved in the collision were taken out of service to undergo inspections and any necessary repairs. The collision caused delays for other flights, with one passenger tweeting: '2 jets hit at Dublin, my flight to Malaga delayed'. Dublin Airport said in a tweet: ‘No injuries on the two aircraft which clipped each other on a taxiway this am. Passengers in process of being taken off the aircraft.’ A passenger snapped this photo of the Boeing 737s after they collided while taxiing to a runway . Emergency services attended the scene of the collision as a precaution, but were not needed . Dublin Airport sent a series of tweet urging passengers to check their flight status . Referring to a similar incident that occurred in October, one passenger wrote on Twitter: ‘Ryanair have done it again, two aircraft have collided while taxiing to the runway #ryanair #facepalm’. A Ryanair spokesperson said the collision occurred as two planes ‘were taxiing slowly’ to the runway. The spokesperson told MailOnline Travel: ‘The winglet of one aircraft appears to have scraped the tail fin of the other. A Ryanair spokesperson said the collision occurred as two planes ‘were taxiing slowly’ to the runway . The Boeing 737 that was preparing to take off for Edinburgh remained on the taxiway for more than an hour . Passengers disembarked and returned to the terminal by bus after the planes collided . ‘Both aircraft were under the instruction of Dublin Airport Air Traffic Control at the time. ‘Customers have been bussed back to the terminal and will board replacement aircraft to continue their journeys to Edinburgh and Zadar. In October a Ryanair jet had its winglet torn off when it collided with another plane belonging to the budget carrier at Dublin Airport. The Boeing 737s heading to Edinburgh and Brussels were taxiing to a runway when they collided in darkness. Passengers’ photos of the aftermath showed the winglet lodged in the rear wing of the plane it crashed into. Last year in June, two Ryanair planes clipped wings – ripping the tip off of one of them – at London Stansted Airport. Customers faces delays of up to three hours after the planes, one bound for Warsaw and one which had just arrived from Frankfurt, collided. Fire trucks surround the Ryanair planes after they collided at Dublin Airport this morning .
Jamie Carragher does not feel Diego Simeone plays the type of football which would attract Arsenal, Manchester United or City. Sportsmail's columnist insists the style of play Atletico Madrid showed against their neighbours Real at the Bernabeu would not impress the three Barclays Premier League giants. 'I love watching him on the sidelines. I love watching his team play, their work rate and their effort, they're a team of men,' Carragher told Sky Sports. Jamie Carragher does not feel Diego Simeone plays the right type of football for the Premier League big boys . Simeone's team battled at the Bernabeu but were unable to take anything away against Real Madrid . Carragher does not feel Simeone plays football which would attract Arsenal, Manchester United or  City . 'But there's no way a top team such as Arsenal, Manchester United or Manchester City would want to watch that and think that is the type of football we want to play. 'The job he had done is unbelievable, I'm not knocking that or his record one bit because I admire him so much. 'But I don't think bigger clubs will look at that and think that's how I want our club to play. I admire it and people at home may say it was a boring game. 'But they're playing Real Madrid. How do you stop them? You stop [Cristiano] Ronaldo. Play deep, leave no space for counter attacks and don't play pretty football because you can lose it and be counter attacked. 'How he sets up against Real Madrid is perfect that is shown in their records. But giants of European football and teams in the Premier League will not want to play like that.' Simeone, on the other hand, was proud of the way Atletico played during their Champions League quarter-final second leg as they lost 1-0 against rivals Real. Carragher insists the style of play Atletico Madrid showed would not impress the three  Premier League giants . Mario Mandzukic looks dejected after Javier Hernandez's late goal saw Real Madrid beat their rivals Atletico . Atletico Madrid were beaten 1-0 after two legs against their neighbours Real in the Champions League . Only Javier Hernandez's strike two minutes from time separated the teams after two legs as Atletico's Arda Turan was sent off for a second yellow card on 76 minutes during the derby. 'I leave feeling proud of my team,' Simeone said afterwards. 'Again we competed superbly in a competition as tough as the Champions League and to be among the eight best teams in Europe is not easy. 'I was always taught that in the game you have to compete and if you give your all you will go home feeling content. I don't have any negative feelings. There are coaches who would be envious to have these players.'

Sleepy shoppers in China have had a rude awakening – after being banned from napping in furniture store IKEA. The Swedish retailer has been forced to take action to stop visitors kicking off their shoes and going to sleep on their beds and sofas. The problem has got so bad that nappers had taken over more than half of beds and sofas in the Xihongmen IKEA shop in Beijing, The People’s Daily reported – with some even getting under the covers for a snooze. Scroll down for video . Managers at Swedish furniture store IKEA have now banned shoppers from sleeping in their beds and sofas . Sleepy shoppers have taken to kicking off their shoes and catching forty winks on the display furniture . The practice has become widespread in IKEA stores - with shoppers coming in especially to take a nap . One weary woman said she had come into IKEA especially to grab a quick forty winks in one of their ‘comfy’ beds. She said she didn’t think it was a big issue, saying: ‘Yes it may affect customers who were shopping in the store but it shouldn’t be too much of a problem.’ Another customer said: ‘Sleeping on the furniture will definitely affect other customers. I can understand the need to take a rest however if you are really having a sleep then that’s not very appropriate.’ One shopper said: 'Yes it may affect customers... but it shouldn't be too much of a problem'. Ikea disagree . IKEA employees said the problem is difficult to manage, because so many Chinese shoppers do it . But long-suffering staff at IKEA said the problem has become widespread across China – with management vowing to clamp down on the practice. Under the new rules customers will still be allowed to try out the sofas and beds, but the removal of shoes to sleep in the beds is banned. One anonymous IKEA assistant warned, however, it will be difficult to enforce the rules. ‘There are old people sleeping and many others are children, what can we say?’ they said. Another employee explained that they currently wake up shoppers if they have been sleeping for an extended period of time – but when they move them on, another quickly fills their place. By banning people from taking off their shoes, IKEA hope to stop Chinese shoppers falling asleep in the stores . Workers at IKEA shops regularly wake up exhausted shoppers - but another napper quickly takes their place . They added: ‘There are too many people doing this, it’s not possible to stop it.’ The MailOnline previously reported on the trend, which commentators saying their Beijing store is particularly popular for a nap because of its air-conditioning during the sweltering summers. It is not the first time IKEA has had to deal with over-familiar customers in China. One Shanghai Xuhui store was inundated with pensioners who would spend their time drinking the free coffee – and on the prowl for a new partner for their children. The practice became so popular that telling people you were going to IKEA became a euphemism in China for ‘going to a matchmaking event’. Genuine shoppers have been unable to see the furniture on sales because of the sleeping people on top of it . IKEA opened up their first shop in China in 1999 and the country is now home to three of the top five largest IKEA stores in the world, only beaten by one in Stockholm. After the first shop opened in Beijing, pictures emerged of shoppers camping out on the sofas with their families, reading newspapers and eating biscuits. The flat-pack chain was founded by 87-year-old Ingvar Kamprad in 1943 and it is now the world’s largest furniture retailer. IKEA first opened in Beijing in 1998, and shoppers were pictured camping out on their sofas with newspapers .
Sheriffs are hunting a gunman who shot a young woman through the neck as she was driving down a Colorado interstate, amid fears he may have tried to attack other drivers too. The unnamed 20-year-old woman was driving on the I-25 in Weld County, north of Denver, when her window shattered and she felt bleeding from both sides of her neck. In a chilling 911 call from around 11pm Wednesday night, she told operators: 'I'm on the highway right now and somebody just hit me and I'm bleeding from my neck and I'm scared. 'I don't know if they hit me or if they threw something out the window... my neck hurts. I think there's glass in my neck.' Scroll down for video . Highway shooting: A bullet passed clean through a woman's neck after she was shot at by an unknown gunman driving down the I-25 highway north of Denver, Colorado . She was taken to hospital where surgeons found she had been shot clean through the neck. Miraculously, the bullet did not damage the woman's airway or sever any major blood vessels. She is expected to recover, according to 7News Denver. The woman, from the nearby town of Milliken, said that she had seen a dark SUV just before her window shattered and she felt the gunshot wound. Deputies from the Weld County Sheriff's Office have said that the shooting may be linked to other unexplained reports of shattered windows on highways in northern Colorado. Hours before the woman was shot, a man's rear window was shattered as he drove on the nearby I-76 after he heard a 'pop' sound which could have been gunfire. The previous day a prison van transporting inmates along the I-25 had its window shattered by an unidentified 'projectile', the Coloradoan reported. Another incident came on Thursday, when a man's driver-side window shattered as he drove down a nearby county road during the daytime. Nobody was injured in any of the other incidents. Larimer County Sheriff Justin Smith said drivers should be aware and report suspicious behavior as deputies investigate. 'There's a lot more leg work that needs to be done on this case,' Smith said. 'It's hard because at this point we have no indication that this person was targeted by a person looking for her.' Deputies were yesterday pictured investigating an abandoned black SUV on I-25, which had shattered rear windows. It is not clear whether this was the vehicle the woman had seen.
A kidnapping in South Carolina was thwarted because the would-be abductor couldn't operate a manual stick shift in the victim's car, police said. 27-year-old Demetri Nelson still had his victim's keys in his pocket when he was arrested Tuesday, several hours after the kidnapping attempt, the Sumter County sheriff's office said in a news release. Deputies said Nelson broke into a 53-year-old woman's home and demanded money. The State reported Nelson allegedly broke into a River Birch Drive home where the victim lives and told her to give him a ride to a Manning Avenue home. Scroll down for video . Apprehended: A kidnapping in South Carolina was thwarted because the would-be abductor, Demetric Nelson, couldn't operate a manual stick shift in the victim's car . Thwarted getaway: Nelson was unable to drive the victim's stick-shift car, pictured . Once they got there, Nelson told the woman to get into the trunk of the car, WFSB reported. Two children were at the home with the victim  at the time of the robbery, according to the television station. Nelson couldn't drive the car because of the manual transmission, however, and the woman used the emergency trunk latch to escape, authorities said. 'As she was able to get out, she was fortunate enough that there were officers from the Sumter Police Department nearby, patrolling the area,' Braden Bunch, a spokesman for the sheriff's office, told WFSB. ' He added 'She flagged them down and when she did, the suspect then ran.' Command: Nelson allegedly broke into a River Birch Drive home and told the woman to take him to a Manning Avenue home (pictured), where he then told her to get into the trunk of the car . Before Nelson was apprehended, the Sumter's County Sheriff's Office wrote in news release posted to Facebook he 'has a history of violent offense convictions and has been placed on the Sumter County Sheriff’s Office Most Wanted list. 'He should be considered armed and dangerous.' Deputies found Nelson and charged him with kidnapping and armed robbery. They said he will also be charged with a possession of a firearm during a violent crime charge. 'Nelson was located and taken into custody without incident around 1 p.m. Tuesday,' the sheriff's office later said in another release posted to Facebook. Bunch told WFSB of the stick-up 'It's got to be incredibly difficult for somebody to deal with that, especially at 1:00 in the morning.' It wasn't known if Nelson had an attorney.
There are up to one million free-roaming dogs on Romania's streets who are being hunted down by 'dog catchers' and stuck in squalid state-run pounds where 'they are waiting to die'. The 'euthanasia' of strays was legalised by the Romanian parliament in September 2013 to help reduce a massive overpopulation. But a group of former models called the K-9 Angels have rescued hundreds of  dogs from the streets where they would be savagely killed - and re-homed at least 700 in the UK. The Angels claim government funds for programmes aimed at neutering the animals were never implemented and the animals were dealt with in the 'most cruel way'. Pola Pospieszalska, Anneka Svenska and former Playboy model Victoria Eisermann are devoted to saving the mistreated dogs - and finding them loving homes. Scroll down for videos . The K-9 Angels charity fronted by singer Pola Pospieszalska (left), TV wildlife presenter Anneka Svenska (right) and former Playboy model Victoria Eisermann (centre) is devoted to saving the mistreated dogs . Rescue: The K-9 Angels (Pola pictured) have rescued hundreds of stray dogs from being killed in Romania and re-homed them in the UK . Second chance: Pola, Anneka and Victoria (pictured) have re-homed at least 700 dogs in the UK and spayed over 2,500 dogs . Overpopulation: Charities estimate there are between 500,000 and one million free-roaming dogs on Romania's streets . Cruelty: Pola described to MailOnline how 'tens of thousands of animals have been caught by dogcatchers (pictured) and killed in most horrific ways' Inhumane: The dogs are supposed to be euthanised humanely with a legal injection but in reality they can be clubbed to death, set on fire and left for dead . Abandoned: Charities have told MailOnline that state-appointed 'dog catchers' are rounding up dogs and taking them to holding pens where they are 'waiting to die' Attack: Pola from K-9 Angels (pictured) she says the 'killing law' was passed following an 'isolated incident' in 2013, when a four-year-old boy was mauled to death by a pack of 'vicious stray dogs' Brutal: The Angels claim government funds for programmes which were designed to neuter dogs were never implemented and the animals were dealt with in the 'most cruel way' They say the state-appointed catchers round up dogs and take them to holding pens where they can be 'clubbed to death' and set on fire. Pola told MailOnline: 'Romania's stray dog situation is probably one of the worst in Europe and sad, neglected, hungry animals are a part of Romanian landscape. She says the 'killing law' was passed following an 'isolated incident' in 2013, when a four-year-old boy was mauled to death by a pack of 'vicious stray dogs'. Adding: 'Tens of thousands of animals have been caught by dogcatchers and killed in most horrific ways. 'It is common in Romania for them not to use a euthanasia injection, but instead dispose of dogs in cheaper ways such as injecting paint thinner into the heart, strangling, clubbing to death.' The founders of K-9 Angels describe the pounds as 'filthy, dirty, short on food'  and in truth - just a place to dump these dogs so they die away from the public'. Here, the dogs suffer from mange - a skin disease caused by parasitic mites - and fights between them erupt regularly. Despite the harsh conditions they are subjected to, the animals who are lucky enough to be alive still vie for the Angels' affection when they are eventually rescued. Animal charity Four Paws - which has helped neuter around 150,000 stray dogs - says the situation for dogs became much worse when the killing law was introduced. Its spokesperson Adam Rahman told MailOnline: 'Dogs are brutally rounded up by dog catchers and taken to pounds where they are subjected to poor conditions and cruel treatment, and are essentially waiting to be killed. 'The organisation responsible for catching the dogs estimated that they had captured around 25,000 stray dogs in Bucharest alone since the legislation was passed, and overseen the killing of around 16,000.' The organisation successfully convinced the Bucharest Court of Appeal to suspend the legislation last summer, but they say the brutal situation on the streets remains the same. Killing: The Romanian government implemented the culling programme to stem the overpopulation of stray dogs but a WHO report says killing the animals will not solve the problem . Humane: Victoria (pictured) and the K-9 Angels have so far re-home at least 700 dogs in the UK and spayed thousands more .

Inspiration: The Angels were formed when Anneka (left) saw of a picture of a desperate Romanian stray on Facebook and decided to do help with her friends Pola and Victoria (right) Found: Like the Angels, charity League of Rescue has also rescued hundreds of stray dogs like Tommy (pictured) from Romania's streets . Happy home: Tommy - who was found malnourished in the back of a rundown car - is now living comfortably in the UK . Desperate: They also found Mabel (pictured) at a train station in an appalling condition and a severe wound on her left paw . Happy ending: Mabel - whose leg was crushed - is one of the lucky ones to be rescued but 16,000 dogs have been culled since it was legalised at the end of 2013 . Inspired: The K-9 Angels were forged when TV wildlife presenter Anneka saw a photograph of a desperate stray dog on the streets of Romania on Facebook . Earlier this month, the charity found evidence of a massive and illegal cull of stray dogs in the small southern town of Clinceni. They discovered dozens of dead dogs with visible wounds on their heads and bodies left to rot in black bags in the forest. 'This is another serious violation of the law on stray animals and proof that, although the killing law has been repealed since June 20, 2014,' Four Paws said. The cull is supposed to reduce the overpopulation of stray dogs in the country but a World Health Organisation report claimed: 'In none of the study areas did the elimination of dogs by any method (catching, shooting or other) have any significant long-term effect on dog population size.' The K-9 Angels were forged when TV wildlife presenter Anneka saw a photograph of a desperate stray dog on the streets of Romania on Facebook. It was the plight of that dog - named Angel - that inspired the trio to officially form the organisation in November 2011. Their petition to calling on the European Union to investigate the 'disappearance' of the public funds designated for a neutering programme has gained over 28,000 signatures. Gruesome: Charity Four Paws discovered dozens of dogs with severe wounds to their head and bodies in the a southern Romanian town . Grotesque: While another charity Dog Rescue Romani claim to see piles of dead dogs left on village roads . A rescue worker with Dog Rescue Romani said they regularly see piles of dead dogs left in the middle of village roads when they patrol the south-west of Romania. Its spokesperson Marius Costache told MailOnline: 'The scenes are such that alive dogs and some puppies were eating from the other dead dogs within the pile. 'We asked someone who said they saw a large truck passing by at 3.30am that night who dumped the pile and left. 'We called our local police right at that moment and the answer was 'so what do you want us to do?' 'With the euthanasia law or without, it the slaughter in Romania public shelters or streets will continue.' Between March and May 2014, a team of investigators from Four Paws investigated 43 public shelters in Romania – from around 81 currently registered with the Romanian vet authorities. The results of the investigation were shocking  as they found that not one of these public shelters in Romania conformed to the law regulating the national programme on stray dogs.
Almost a third of teachers have suffered online bullying at the hands of parents in the last year, a survey suggests. Families are using social media to post obscenities, threats, offensive photos, sexually explicit insults and even covert films of teachers. Around 30 per cent of teachers said they had been the subject of parents’ abusive internet posts. A study of 1,500 teachers found 30 per cent have suffered online abuse by parents - and that this type of bullying is on the rise accounting for 40 per cent of all reported online insults this year . And the poll found that bullying by parents is on the rise, accounting for 40 per cent of all reported online insults this year compared to just 27 per cent last year. The survey, by teachers’ union NASUWT, reveals a disturbing picture of how parents are increasingly using Facebook and Twitter to intimidate staff. One teacher said they had been sworn at by a parent online over a PE lesson, while a female dance teacher said she had been called a ‘paedophile’ for wanting to film a performance. Others said they had received insults from parents about their appearance and weight, with one told she was ugly and her ‘husband could do better than her’. Of those harassed online by parents, 15 per cent had threats made against them, compared to seven per cent in 2014. The poll  also showed that the proportion of teachers suffering abuse from both parents and pupils has more than doubled over the past year . Around eight per cent saw allegations of inappropriate behaviour with students, six per cent saw videos or photos taken without consent and three per cent were told they had behaved inappropriately towards parents. The poll of 1,500 teachers also showed that the proportion of teachers suffering abuse from both parents and pupils has more than doubled over the past year – increasing from 21 per cent to 60 per cent. NASUWT general secretary Chris Keates said: ‘It is deeply worrying to see that the abuse of teachers has risen by such a huge margin this year. 'Equally concerning is that it appears that more parents are the perpetrators of the abuse.’ He added: ‘The vile, insulting and personal comments are taking their toll on teachers’ health and wellbeing and undermining their confidence to do their job.’ The survey found that many teachers had received racist, sexist and homophobic remarks online – with one teacher called a ‘wog’ by a pupil and others called ‘lesbian’ and ‘slut’. And teachers said that 60 per cent of the abusive comments online had been written by pupils. Over half of the pupils responsible for abuse were aged between 14 and 16, while 38 per cent were aged between 11 and 14, the teachers’ poll found. One teacher received the comment ‘I hope she gets cancer’, while a heavily pregnant worker was sworn at, called ‘fat whore’ and ‘ugly’. Another said they had been harassed for seven months by pupils who sent sexually explicit messages and set up a fake social media account in their name. A number of teachers reported pupils had used their identity to set up bogus Facebook profiles and post sexually inappropriate messages. One man only found out months afterwards and feared it could be used to ‘smear him’ and destroy his career. Just under a third of bullied teachers did not report the incidents to their school or to police. Mrs Keates went on to say: ‘While there has been some improvement in action taken on reported abuse, there are still too many cases where no appropriate action is taken and teachers are being left devastated, humiliated and traumatised.’ The union called for the next government to require schools to adopt a zero-tolerance approach to online abuse and use all sanctions available to address any bullying of staff. Some of the most disturbing examples of online abuse from parents include: . A female attacked by parents for her appearance and the size of her nose. She was told she was ‘ugly’ and ‘her husband could do better’. Another was called ‘rubbish’, with a mother incorrectly claiming that she had ‘tried to kill her daughter’ by making her do PE without an inhaler. A parent posted comments saying that a female dance teacher was ‘a paedophile’ for videoing performances. A teacher was sworn at and told he was ‘pathetic’ for asking a pupil to replace equipment he had broken. Family members falsely accused a teacher of having sex with pupils – making him fear for his career.
A British former car mechanic who joined the Islamic State as an explosives expert and sniper has shared chilling images of his new high-tech bomb-making factory in Syria. Hamayun Tariq, a divorced 37-year-old who was born and raised in Dudley in the West Midlands, shared four images on Twitter of a room where he claims to make devices known as IEDs. Components are seen organised on shelves and instruction manuals and bomb-making equipment neatly laid out on work surfaces in the room, which the father-of-two says he hopes will emerge as 'the best Electronics LAB in the Islamic state'. Scroll down for video . Well-equipped: British former car mechanic Hamayun Tariq -  who joined the Islamic State as an explosives expert and sniper - has shared chilling images of his new high-tech bomb-making factory in Syria . Boastful: Components are seen organised on shelves in the room, which the father-of-two says he hopes will emerge as 'the best Electronics LAB in the Islamic state' Tariq's social media presence rarely last longer than a few days before being suspended as he specialises in posting detailed instructions on how to build bombs. Despite already doing the same on his latest account, the militant has been able to share images of his bomb-making factory, where he boastfully claims to spend time 'producing sophisticated IEDs'. Terror: Hamayun Tariq is a divorced, 37-year-old father-of-two who was born and raised in Dudley . Tariq - who uses the nom de guerre Abu Muslim al-Britani - has methodically arranged the room into areas for building bombs and areas to check their function. He clearly uses expensive equipment, including high-tech microscopes, laptops and radiation testers while building the IEDs and detailed bomb-making manuals are dotted around the factory. After posting photographs of his 'laboratory', the jihadi wrote on Twitter: 'IEDs is my favourite weapon after Sniping, u hit the enemy & disappear in thin air just like a Ghost. Its a Must'. Tariq served a sentence for fraud in the UK before joining ISIS in Syria late last year. Shortly after joining the terrorist group he began posting detailed explosive-making instructions and encouraging 'lone wolves' still living in the West to carry out deadly bomb attacks. Tariq has previously posted under various Twitter handles but he is usually suspended rarely quickly thanks to bomb-making guides and sickening calls for terror attacks in the UK. He regularly posted photographs of handwritten instructions explaining how to assemble crude explosive devices and listing the chemicals needed to create deadly poisons. Chilling: Hamayun Tariq - who uses the nom de guerre Abu Muslim al-Britani - has methodically arranged the room into areas for building bombs and areas to check their functionality . Sick: Tariq served a sentence for fraud in the UK before joining ISIS in Syria last year. He soon began posting detailed explosive-making instructions and encouraging 'lone wolves' to carry out deadly bomb attacks . ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has been seriously injured in an air strike and is no longer in control of the terrorist group, according to an Iraqi source. The source said that he was wounded by an attack from the US-led coalition while travelling in a three-car convoy in March in Nineveh, Iraq. At first his chances of survival were deemed by his lieutenants to be low, but he pulled through. However, he was left so weakened that his inner circle reportedly mooted the idea of naming a new leader. He is slowly recovering but does not have the reins of the organisation, according to The Guardian . Two officials confirmed to the paper that the strike on the convoy did indeed take place, on March 18 in the al-Baaj district of Nineveh, not far from the Syrian border. One, a Western diplomat, told the paper that Coalition generals weren’t sure whether al-Baghdadi was in the convoy. Tariq's Twitter rants appear to have been in retaliation for him allegedly having his British passport revoked in 2013. One of his most widely shared messages was a sarcastic note of 'thanks' to Home Secretary Theresa May for 'revoking my British citizenship'. Alongside the message was page after page of bomb-making material from a 2006 terrorist manual named the Mujahideen Explosives Handbook. Tariq previously claimed to have encountered up to 40 other British nationals in his first seven weeks as an ISIS fighter in Syria, according to the Guardian, who spoke to him via Twitter's private messaging function on a now disabled account. Describing himself as 'really happy' to have joined the terror group, he reportedly added that he had also met a 'fixer' who was smuggling 1,000 new recruits into ISIS-held areas of Syria every week. He reportedly told the newspaper that he first embraced radical Islam in 2000. Tariq was arrested for fraud in Wolverhampton in 2005 but fled to Pakistan to avoid the case going to trial. He was deported back to Britain two years later and served three and a half years in prison. He claims to have left Britain immediately after his release in 2012 and moved to the Waziristan region of north west Pakistan, where he joined the local Taliban branch. Expensive: Hamayun Tariq clearly uses expensive equipment, including high-tech microscopes, laptops and radiation testers while building the IEDs and detailed bomb-making manuals are dotted around the factory . One of Tariq's most widely shared messages was this sarcastic note of 'thanks' to Home Secretary Theresa May for 'revoking my British citizenship'. Alongside the message posted on this long-disabled account was a copy of bomb-making material from a 2006 terrorist manual named the Mujahideen Explosives Handbook . In September or early October Tariq is understood to have been contacted by ISIS fixers who paid for his transport to join the terror group in Syria. He was trained as a sniper before moving on to specialise in explosives - a subject he has been interested in since studying for a GCSE in Science in the mid-1990s. Tariq described his new life under ISIS as far more comfortable than that in Pakistan. 'Life was tough in Waziristan but here I can't believe I get a salary, I get rent. They even paid for my transport. I'm really happy here and all the guys I've met from the UK are also happy and settled,' he was quoted as saying. The Home Office would not speak about Tariq's claim that his passport had been cancelled, saying they could not comment on individual cases. However they did add that in a broader sense any individual who has conducted himself 'in a manner seriously prejudicial to the vital interests of the UK' can have their citizenship revoked. The Home Office has said there are at least 500 Britons fighting for ISIS in Syria and Iraq, although a number of experts believe the real figure is likely to greatly exceed that.
French giants Paris Saint-Germain have been dealt a major blow with the news that David Luiz will miss the Champions League clash with Barcelona. The former Chelsea man pulled up clutching his hamstring following a bursting run against Andre-Pier Gignac in the first-half of Sunday’s game against rivals Marseille. Current French champions PSG went on to win the game but the news of Luiz’ injury came as a major worry. David Luiz carries the ball out of defence on one of his trademark forays, but one such run led to his injury . The Brazilian defender immediately signalled to the bench that he would need to be replaced . And those worries have since been confirmed as scans revealed the Brazilian will be out of action for at least four weeks meaning he will miss both legs of the quarter-final tie with Barcelona. Laurent Blanc’s side are still fighting for the Ligue One title and could be forced to play eight matches without the 27-year-old. PSG currently sit top of the pile in France just one point ahead of Lyon in second. Luiz limped off, and could now be a doubt for the Champions league quarter-final against Barcelona .
A 15-year-old boy has been arrested for allegedly robbing, beating and sexually assaulting a woman on a Chicago train after his mother recognized his face on released surveillance images and turned him in to police. DeShawn Isabelle punched the 41-year-old woman in the head from behind and then dragged her to the ground by pulling on her hair before continuing to punch her in the head and face as she crouched in the fetal position, according to Assistant State’s Attorney Joe DiBella. Isabelle also stole $2,000 in cash that the woman was going to wire back to her family in Thailand and spent it on junk food, Air Jordan track suits and his graduation fees, DiBella said. Scroll down for video . DeShawn Isabelle, 15, has been arrested for allegedly robbing, beating and sexually assaulting a woman on a Chicago train after his mother recognized his face on surveillance images and turned him in to police . The middle school student was sitting in the otherwise empty carriage when the woman boarded the CTA train in Oak Park on Monday at 3pm, according to the Chicago Tribune. During the brutal beating, Isabelle put his hands inside the woman's pants and sexually assaulted her, according to DiBella. The teen also allegedly groped the woman over her clothes and slapped her buttocks and then sat on her head as he continued to beat her. Isabelle pinned the woman down with his knees when the train stopped at the next station, prosecutors said. When no one entered the carriage, he then dragged the woman by her hair to a partially enclosed area and continued to punch, kick and stomp all over the woman's body as he pushed her face down and demanded money, DiBella said. Isabelle then stole the woman's iPhone and got off on the Cicero stop to hop a train heading in the opposite direction, DiBella said the teenager later told authorities. The woman pushed the car's emergency button after the train began moving again and was attended to by CTA personnel. She was left with bruises and cuts all over her body as well as a concussion after the six-minute ride. Isabelle was sitting in the otherwise empty carriage when the woman boarded the CTA train in Oak Park on Monday at 3pm and allegedly beat and assaulted her during the six minute ride before getting off at Cicero . DiBella said the woman was still vomiting from the extent of her injuries on Wednesday, according to NBC Chicago. Isabelle's mother turned her son in to the police after she recognized his face in surveillance photos publicly released by the CTA following the brutal attack. DiBella said the teenager admitted to robbing, beating and sexually assaulting the woman and gave a handwritten confession. Isabelle's fingerprints were also matched to the train window he was seen touching and kicking in the CTA surveillance video before attacking the woman, according to DiBella. Police also searched the middle school student's home and recovered the jacket he is seen wearing in the video of the assault, DiBella said. Officers were also able to recover the woman's iPhone after Isabelle told them where he had discarded it, according to prosecutors. Isabelle was charged as an adult with aggravated sexual assault and robbery and is being held on $1million bail. The teen was previously convicted as a juvenile for misdemeanor theft. Isabelle's mother became aggravated as DiBella held a press conference to discuss the prosecution's version of the case, according to the Chicago Tribune. 'Don't talk that s*** about my child,' she yelled, before she was told to leave.
The family rift in France’s National Front deepened yesterday after founder Jean-Marie Le Pen pulled out of regional elections – but said his granddaughter should stand in his place. The 86-year-old’s announcement came after he infuriated his daughter Marine, the far-right party’s current leader, with a series of racist and anti-Semitic remarks last week. Mr Le Pen had repeated his claim that the Holocaust - in which the Nazis murdered six million Jews - was ‘a detail of history’ and had also praised France’s wartime leader Marshal Petain, who collaborated with Hitler. Keeping it in the family: National Front founder Jean-Marie Le Pen, 86, right,  angered daughter Marine, 46, and now wants granddaughter Marion Marechal-Le Pen, 25, to replace him in the regional elections . Next generation: Shortly after her grandfather's comments, Marion Marechal-Le Pen, 25, pictured with Le Pen in 2012, confirmed that she would seek the party’s nomination . His 46-year-old daughter had reacted furiously to the outburst, saying she would oppose his candidacy in regional elections in December and accusing him of ‘political suicide’. Now party founder Le Pen has told French publication Le Figaro that he will not stand in the south-east Provence-Alpes-Cote d’Azur region ‘even though I think I am the best candidate’. He said it was because the party was at risk of being ‘dangerously weakened’ over what he called a severe but unjustified crisis over his comments. The former paratrooper, who remains the Front’s honorary president and will retain his seat in the European Parliament, said: ‘If I must make a sacrifice for the future of the movement, I would not be the one to cause it damage,’ Mr Le Pen said the best replacement candidate would be his grand-daughter Marion Marechal-Le Pen, 25, who confirmed shortly after that she would seek the party’s nomination. Family feud: National Front leader Marine accused her father of 'political suicide' after he called the Holocaust ‘a detail of history’ and had also praised France’s wartime leader Marshal Petain . Mr Le Pen told the magazine: ‘If she accepts, I think she would head a very good list (of candidates). She is certainly the best, I am not going to say after me, but she is.’ His granddaughter is seen as more socially conservative than her aunt. Unlike Marine, Marion was firmly against a 2013 law permitting same-sex marriage in France. Asked if he felt betrayed by his daughter, Mr Le Pen told Le Figaro Magazine: ‘Betrayed would be going a bit far, but let’s say I’m disappointed.’ A top party official, Florian Philippot, said on i-Tele television that Le Pen had discussed the decision with party leadership. By standing down, Mr Le Pen avoids possible formal exclusion as a candidate on Friday, when the National Front’s political bureau meets to designate who will run in the December election. Opinion polls see Marine Le Pen as likely to make it to the second round of 2017 presidential elections but not win.
A gang of fly-tippers have dumped a staggering 40 tonnes of industrial waste at the side of the road in a pretty Suffolk village. The mounds of rubbish, described by one police officer as the worst he has seen in almost 30 years, will cost the public purse thousands of pounds to clear up. It is believed the gang used three tractors and trailers to dump the industrial waste in Walsham-le-Willows, between Eye and Bury St Edmunds, . Flytipping: A 40-tonne pile of industrial waste has been dumped by the side of the road in a Suffolk village . Dumped: Police believe the fly-tippers used three tractors and trailers to transport the rubbish to the roadside . The gang piled up the rubbish, which includes materials used in the carpet and veterinary industries, at about 9.30pm on Thursday. PC Mark Bryant, a rural crime officer, said: 'It's horrific. I have never seen anything like it in my 28 years, certainly not in Suffolk, not on that scale and not as blatant.' He added: 'It's quite incredible. If it's a black bin in a layby you almost expect to see it but not three trailers full - this is unheard of. 'We do get more of it at this time of year and we have recently started a campaign against it with the NFU (National Farmers' Union) and CLA (Country Land and Business Association).' 'Horrific': PC Mark Bryant, rural crime officer, said it is the worst case of flytipping he's seen in 28 years . Campaign: Police, the National Farmers' Union and the Country Land and Business Association are trying to prevent fly-tipping . Jessica Fleming, county councillor for Walsham-le-Willows, said: 'I am obviously absolutely appalled and disappointed to hear that this has happened but I hope that the people who have done this will be caught. 'It would have been shocking for people passing in their cars - I certainly will be following this up and trying to find the culprits." Police and Environment Agency officers are now trying to clear the huge pile of waste.
Children who experience stressful events such as a death or illness in the family, divorce or separation, could be three times more likely to develop type 1 diabetes. Swedish scientists analysed more than 10,000 families with children aged two to 14 who did not have the condition, looking at whether there was any family conflict, a change of family structure, interventions from social services or unemployment. Subsequently, 58 children were diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. The researchers found many were among those badly affected by events in their formative years. Children who experience stressful events such as a death or illness in the family, divorce or separation, could be three times more likely to develop type 1 diabetes (stock image above) The team at Linkoping University said that while the causes of type 1 diabetes are unknown, it is usually preceded by the body’s immune system killing so-called beta cells in the pancreas that produce insulin. They suggested damaging events in childhood could affect beta cells and raise insulin demands to cope with elevated levels of stress hormones. Other factors include viral infection, dietary habits, birth weight and early weight gain. The study concluded: ‘The experience of a serious life event during the first 14 years of life may be a risk factor. The study suggested damaging events in childhood could affect beta cells and raise insulin demands to cope with elevated levels of stress hormones. Above, a woman tests her blood sugar . 'The current study examined serious life events experienced at any time before diagnosis; further studies are thus needed to determine when in the autoimmune process psychological stress may contribute.' Genetic predisposition remains the most important factor, with a 12-fold increase in the risk of developing type 1 diabetes for a child from a family in which another close family member has it. The majority of people have type 2 diabetes, which is associated with being overweight, but more than 95 per cent of cases of diabetes in children are type 1 and rates have been increasing in recent years.
Gareth Bale was verbally abused by supporters outside Real Madrid's training ground and slaughtered by Spanish media as he was blamed for the goalless draw in the Champions League. Almost a month after the world's most expensive footballer's white Bentley was attacked by fans at the Valdebebas base, Bale met more angry supporters following their 0-0 stalemate with Atletico Madrid. The £86million signing was singled out by those waiting for the players to leave the training base early on Wednesday morning, as they labelled his performance lazy and told him to 'run more'. Scroll down for video . Gareth Bale was verbally abused by supporters outside the club's training ground on Wednesday morning . It came almost a month after the world's most expensive footballer's white Bentley was attacked by fans . Bale has become a scapegoat for the club and was slaughtered by Spanish media after his one-on-one miss . It comes after Marca gave Bale just five out of 10 while AS awarded him one star, as Spanish media tore into the Welshman following his one-on-one miss at the Vicente Calderon on Tuesday night. Bale could have given the visitors the lead early on as he only had relatively untried goalkeeper Jan Oblak to beat, but scuppered the opportunity. Even the club's captain and  goalkeeper Iker Casillas admitted Bale's miss was costly. 'It's difficult to assimilate that in seven games against Atletico we didn't win one,' said Casillas. 'If Gareth Bale scores it is a different game to what we saw. But then it was a great save.' As well as giving him poor ratings, Marca went one further by publishing a separate damning analysis of Bale, in which they write he should have 'kept his cool' and has a 'mental block'. Real Madrid drew 0-0 with city rivals Atletico and Bale's costly miss made the front pages of the newspapers . Bale raced through for this one-on-one chance with Atletico Madrid goalkeeper Jan Oblak . Real Madrid's £86million signing Bale missed the one-on-one chance and the game ended in a 0-0 draw .

A veteran Georgia middle school teacher has been removed from the classroom after she gave students her highly critical personal opinion of President Barack Obama and some parents complained. Nancy Perry will no longer teach students at Dublin Middle School and will retire at the end of the year, city schools superintendent Chuck Ledbetter announced on Tuesday. Perry is alleged to have told students that Obama is a Muslim and that any parent who support him couldn't be Christian, either. Nancy Perry, left, won't teach again at Dublin Middle School in Georgia after she gave students her highly critical personal opinion of President Barack Obama and parent Jimmie Scott complained . A 12-year-old boy in Perry's class brought the matter to the attention of his father, Jimmie Scott, who complained to the school. 'If your parents voted for Obama, they're evil and I don't see how your parents could vote for someone that's Muslim' he told WMAZ, paraphrasing Perry's alleged comments. Scott said he immediately requested a parent-teacher conference to which Perry brought along her husband Bill, who sits on the county Board of Education. Instead of discussing Nancy Perry's classroom comments, Scott says that she and her husband showed him what he described as internet propaganda. 'She showed it to me and said, "See, Obama is a baby killer. He aborts babies at nine months old as they're coming through the birth canal."' Superintendent Ledbetter said Perry was already planning on retiring before the complaint about her behavior. 'On behalf of the School District, we want to apologize to the student and to his parents,' he said at a school board meeting. Scott said he requested a parent-teacher conference, but Nancy Perry brought along her husband Bill, pictured above, who sites on the Board of Education.  The pair showed him what he described as anti-Obama internet propaganda . City schools superintendent Chuck Ledbetter says school principals are now required to call the superintendent if any board member asks to sit in on parent-teacher meetings . 'It is not the place of teachers to attempt to persuade students about religious or political beliefs.' Scott also addressed the community at the meeting, saying his family had been ridiculed and had racial slurs thrown at them. Scott is black and Perry is white. 'We've lost loved ones in the community because a line was drawn,' Scott said. 'Either you were for my son or you were for the teacher.' Ledbetter also apologized for the actions of Perry's husband, who he said shouldn't have attended the parent-teacher conference. Ledbetter said school principals are now required to call the superintendent if any board member asks to sit in on a parent-teacher meeting. 'See, Obama is a baby killer. He aborts babies at nine months old' Nancy Perry is alleged to have told Jimmie Scott .
Andros Townsend enjoyed silencing the critics with his wonder strike for England, saying naysayers like Paul Merson provided the perfect motivation for him in Italy. This has been a topsy-turvy season for the 23-year-old, who has yet to reach the heights he scaled when he first burst onto the international scene. Three Lions manager Roy Hodgson has, however, kept faith with the Tottenham winger - belief he paid back in quite exceptional fashion at the Juventus Stadium.

A 46-year-old man has been reported missing after a kayak he had taken out with his fiance capsized in choppy waters. Vincent Viafore from Poughkeepsie, New York, was on the rough Hudson River near Newburgh with Angelika Graswald when he was thrown in on Sunday evening. According to CBS 2, Viafore was not wearing a life jacket and was unable to get back into the kayak. Scroll down for video . Vincent Viafore (right) from Poughkeepsie, New York, was on the rough Hudson River near Newburgh with Angelika Graswald (left) when he was thrown in on Sunday evening. He is still missing . She managed to make it out of the water and call 911. On Monday she asked friends on Facebook to keep praying for her partner and hoped for a miracle . His partner fell out of the boat while trying to help him and was rescued by another boat travelling in the area at the time. She then called 911 when she made it to land. Graswald was taken to hospital and treated for hypothermia but her fiance has not been found. On Monday she asked friends for their prayers as the search continued. She wrote on Facebook: 'I just want to thank everyone for reaching out. Please, keep your prayers for Vince. 'Miracles ARE possible. The authorities are doing everything they can. 'We do not need anyone else getting hurt, as it is very dangerous out there, especially without daylight. Please, no questions at this point, we're doing everything we can. We will find him.' New York State Police Captain Brendan Casey told CBS 2: 'Yesterday, it started out as a nice day and as the day went on, it grew cooler and the winds picked up and it became more like today.' Viafore was not wearing a life jacket and was unable to get back into the kayak . Residents say the water at this time of year is ' precarious ' as it is so cold . Viafore's friend Wes Gottlock said he saw them out on the water, but did not discover there was a search underway until later on that evening. He added that the couple had been together for a long time and have a 'wonderful relationship'. He said the water at this time of the year is 'precarious' as the water is still cold. Peter Brandt, who has lived by the water for 40 years, asked if they were 'accomplished kayakers' because the water was very rough.
Twickenham will stage a thunderous collision between two French juggernauts in 13 days’ time, although Toulon’s crusade to win an unprecedented third successive European title nearly stalled at Stade Velodrome on Sunday. On this faltering, unconvincing evidence, the holders of the last Heineken Cup face a mammoth task if they are to stop Clermont Auvergne from claiming the inaugural Champions Cup. Bernard Laporte’s stellar side didn’t come to life until this dismal encounter went into extra-time and they were only galvanised once they had been reduced to 14 men, when Ali Williams was sin-binned for taking out Devin Toner in the air. Toulon winger Bryan Habana races away for a decisive try in extra-time against Leinster . Habana intercepted Ian Madigan's long pass to race away unopposed at Stade Velodrome . Leinster full back Rob Kearney beats Toulon flanker Juan Fernandez Lobbe to a high ball in the first-half . Instead of being undermined by the loss of the ex-All Blacks lock, Toulon scored the crucial points while he was off the field. Their victory was founded on the composed goal-kicking of their Welsh Lion at full-back, Leigh Halfpenny, who finished with 20 points from six penalties and a conversion. Leinster attempted to capitalise on their numerical advantage and it backfired in the 90th minute as Ian Madigan’s long pass was intercepted by Bryan Habana and the Springbok wing stormed clear to for the game’s only try. That the one fleeting flicker of creativity stemmed from an error was fitting. The Irish province wouldn’t go quietly and when Sean O’Brien went over from a close-range lineout drive, they were back in the hunt with five minutes remaining, but it wasn’t to be. So, the climax of the new continental tournament will have a familiar feel. Toulon vs Clermont is an all-French repeat of the 2013 Heineken Cup Final in Dublin, which the Cote d’Azur club won despite being dominated by Clermont for much of the game. Last year, they gave Jonny Wilkinson the perfect career sign-off with another triumph in Cardiff – where Saracens were dispatched – and now they are closing in on a hat-trick. But there was no swagger about them on Sunday, or any sustained power surges for that matter. It was unusually wet by the Mediterranean and the conditions made handling difficult, but that didn’t account for the sheer deluge of fumbles made by both sides. As a showcase of Europe’s elite event, this stop-start contest left much to be desired. For all the effort and commitment, there was no fluency or cohesion, no rhythm or flow. The teams simply took it in turns to launch a raid and either spill the ball or concede a turnover. Leinster centre Madigan fires over one of his five successful penalties against Toulon . English referee Wayne Barnes became the pantomime villain of the home supporters for repeatedly penalising their idols, but he had every right to on several occasions, particularly when Xavier Chiocci, the Toulon loosehead prop, was being dismantled by Ireland tighthead Mike Ross in the scrum. As an occasion, this was several notches below the blood-and-thunder epic between Clermont and Saracens in St Etienne 24 hours earlier. Clermont’s ‘Yellow Army’ – or ‘Jaunards’ – created a raucous, partisan atmosphere which wasn’t matched here by the Toulon hordes. There was a healthy crowd in excess of 35,000, but that was a long way short of capacity and the noise was often restricted to boos for the officials. Even the Mexican Waves late on were half-hearted. Leinster blindside Jordi Murphy does brilliantly to get up and disrupt a Toulon lineout . Still, it was not all grim. Steffon Armitage made his trademark breakdown impact after coming on as a replacement and Halfpenny’s class stood out throughout – not just as a goal-kicker but, crucially, in the way he handled the aerial onslaught with aplomb. The Wales idol had landed four penalties in normal time but saved his best for the end of the first half of extra-time – just before Habana’s try – when he struck from halfway, with inches to spare. Afterwards, he reflected on the prospect of a first appearance in Europe’s elite final, saying: ‘It’s what I grew up dreaming about. Toulon No 8 Chris Masoe makes a strong run as Leinster scrum half Isaac Boss tries to make the tackle . ‘I grew up watching European Cup Finals and you work hard day-in, day-out to be involved in big games like that. For me, coming to Toulon with the success they’ ve achieved and the ambition they have, I wanted to be part of that. I was fortunate enough to be given the opportunity.’ Toulon were fortunate that he took his opportunities on Sunday. It meant that their shortcomings were not critically exposed and they will surely rouse themselves to far greater heights for the final. Their showdown with Clermont will shake Twickenham to its foundations. These twin French giants are the dominant forces of the era - the rest of Europe are chasing their shadows. Toulon full back Leigh Halfpenny makes no mistake from the kicking tee after Leinster infringed .
Not everyone should be behind the wheel of a $50,000 car. That's one lesson to take away from a video posted by YouTube user Richard Stewart showing a Porsche Cayman flying out of control as it speeds from a green light on Prince Edward Island in Canada. The sports car swerves wildly before smashing into the concrete median. A wheel even comes off before the car finally comes to a halt. 'Just cause you have a nice car doesn't make you a good driver. Don't let your son drive your Porsche!" wrote Stewart on YouTube about the crash. KHOU reports that police have not made the identity of the driver public but have said that a 31-year-old driver was cited for the crash, leaving the car a totaled as it was towed away. The footage begins with the Porsche idling at a green light . The car booms ahead at a dangerous speed . Almost immediately the driver begins to lose control . The unidentified man verse wildly across the dividing line . The car is twisting at such dangerous speeds a wheel comes loose . Finally the car comes to a halt, a total wreck waiting for the tow truck .
Just ten games. That is all Tim Sherwood has needed to bring Aston Villa out from the morgue and into life. Rigor mortis was setting in when he took over the club, but now the muscles are being flexed. An FA Cup final awaits. There have been mistakes, notably in defeats to Stoke City and Swansea, but five glorious wins and a brand of football to excite and embolden far outweighs them. Having been appointed on Valentine’s Day, Villa fans have fallen in love after only nine weeks. Here, Sportsmail looks at five reasons for Sherwood’s success. Tim Sherwood has had an inspired start in charge of Aston Villa as they reached the FA Cup final . Benteke's back . Upon arrival, Sherwood recognised the area he needed to target instantly: goals. Hardly rocket science but launching Villa’s scoring figures skywards was easier said than done. Straightaway as manager he had a sit down in his office with Christian Benteke where he told the Belgian striker: ‘Two years ago, every club in Europe wanted you.’ The point being to re-inject confidence in this quiet character. Benteke is determined but responds well to arm-round-shoulder words. At the end of his reign, Paul Lambert tried stick to inspire Benteke’s best, dropping him for the visit of Chelsea. Benteke understood, but was nevertheless frustrated. He felt starved of service in Lambert’s safety-first style. Christian Benteke has flourished under Sherwood and has scored nine in his last seven for Villa . Sherwood addressed this immediately. During half-time in the FA Cup match against Leicester – the day before his unveiling – he entered the dressing room and told his players to get the ball to Benteke more often, and quicker. Villa scored two second half goals to progress. Benteke has now got nine in his last seven for Villa, having scored three in 18 under Lambert this season. There is variety, pace, and creativity in the final third and Villa have already surpassed under Sherwood the total goals managed with Lambert at the helm this season: 16 goals in 10 games, compared to 15 in 28. The Belgian international fires home the equaliser at Wembley as he helped Villa conquer Liverpool . Trust in youth . For around an hour after carrying out media duties on Friday, Sherwood stood to watch Villa’s Under-11s squad as they trained at Bodymoor Heath. The man for whom youth development is so important was able to find time on the eve of his biggest managerial test to observe a crop of potential talents who will only be senior players many years down the line. That kind of commitment breeds belief across the training pitches. His faith in Jack Grealish is the biggest illustration of his philosophy, but he also handed Rushian Hepburn-Murphy his debut as a substitute at Aston Villa aged 16. Since Sherwood’s arrival, the under-21s have been moved to train on pitches adjacent to the first-team and a number regularly join in with sessions when 11 v 11, Kevin Toner and Lewis Kinsella among them. Jack Grealish was the star man against Brendan Rodgers' side and has earned rave reviews under Sherwood . Sherwood attended the City Ground last Wednesday to witness 22-year-old Gary Gardner, on loan at Nottingham Forest from Villa, score a brilliant free-kick. The night previous he was at Rochdale v Swindon to possibly run the rule over Massimo Luongo, also 22, his under-21 captain when at Tottenham. Such an approach is with eyes on building the club over the coming months and years but short-term it has served to bring renewed energy. The former Tottenham boss is keen on youth development and watched on-loan Gary Gardner score . Delph delivering . Fabian Delph signed his new contract at Villa before Sherwood arrived – it was actually announced on the big screens at Villa Park ahead of the FA Cup clash with Bournemouth – but the 25-year-old has since been handed key responsibilities. The England midfielder, described as Villa’s Hoover by Sherwood, was given the captain’s armband permanently, taking over from Ron Vlaar and leapfrogging deputy Gabby Agbonlahor, based on his mentality and exuberant grit in midfield. He has led by example, turning in performances that make him a certainty for Roy Hodgson. Fabian Delph is arguably Villa's most important player and he's become a real leader under new management . Sherwood has asked for more forward movement too, and offensive involvement. Delph’s ability to drive past players – exhibited for both goals at Wembley – was compared to Paul Gascoigne by Sherwood and the Bradford-born player has responded to that acclaim. He has two goals under Sherwood after not finding the net once this season for Lambert. ‘When I came to the club Fabian Delph had just signed a new contract, he had an opportunity to go to some of the teams in the top four. He showed a lot of loyalty,’ says Sherwood. ‘I need characters like that, put themselves on the line. He can add goals to his game, he has so much energy he can get into the final third and score. He’s nicked a couple for me already. I just want to encourage him to do that and then he’ll be too expensive for anyone to buy.’ The England international scored the winner at Wembley to send his side into the FA Cup Final in May . Sound staff moves . Sherwood acted swiftly in the backroom department too, bringing in Mark Robson as first-team coach, and Seamus Brady as performance analyst before his first official game in charge. He knows these guys from working at Tottenham and values their input. Tony Parks, former goalkeeping coach at Spurs, arrived in the days after the loss to Stoke, curtailing a move to Norwich to join up with a manager he respects greatly. Parks is a trusted friend and vocal presence on the touchline, the one who bear-hugged Sherwood from behind, lifting him off his feet, when Benteke rolled in the stoppage time penalty to beat West Bromwich Albion in the Premier League. As assistant Sherwood made a smart move, offering Kevin McDonald the chance to renew his Villa relationship. The 54-year-old was the club’s hugely successful reserve team boss and has developed younger players during a 17-year association that ended during the early days of Lambert's reign in June 2012. He was also caretaker manager after Martin O’Neill left and nearly got the job permanently. ‘I wanted someone who knew the fabric of the club,’ says Sherwood. Tony Parks (left centre) was one of many new staff members brought in to help save Villa from relegation . Stiliyan Petrov has also been into the dressing room to offer words of advice, although he is yet to formalise any coaching arrangement. Training is sharp and intense, largely tailored to replicate matchdays and goal-scoring situations. Inspiring confidence . Sherwood said after the victory over Liverpool that the players believed they would win and the fans did too, suggesting many had already booked their hotels for the final on May 30. It is clear confidence is coursing through this Villa team now, the shackles not being so much thrown off as plunged to the bottom of the ocean to collect rust. The 46-year-old has added a new found confidence to his sides game and is reaping the benefits . Sherwood divides opinion with his outspoken comments but from within the club such positivity has spread to form a confident collective unit. 'He sits and he chats to people. He treats people like men,’ says Parks. ‘The guys have responded to that – sitting them down, treating them with respect, letting them know when they’re playing well, letting them know when they’re not playing so well. ‘I look around, he’s the manager and I believe what he tells me. I think the players believe what he tells them as well. He’s a good leader.'
Dick Advocaat says Jermain Defoe’s wonder goal has set Sunderland on their way to Premier League survival – but Newcastle goalkeeper Tim Krul has been criticised for appearing to congratulate the derby match-winner. The Holland international waited in the tunnel for Defoe at half-time, seconds after he had smashed the stunning 20-yard volley which decided yesterday’s Tyne-Wear clash. Krul smiled and exchanged a fist pump with Defoe, although he later defended his actions. Sportsmail's Jamie Carragher claimed Newcastle keeper Tim Krul made a mistake after congratulating Sunderland striker Jermain Defoe on his goal before half-time . Krul smiles at Defoe shortly after the striker's goal gave the Black Cats the lead in the Wear-Tyne derby . Carragher criticised Krul for his half-time actions while speaking on Sky Sports after the game . However, former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher was not impressed, as he said: ‘When you watch Newcastle, Tim Krul does look like one of the leaders of the team, but what he did was a mistake. ‘I wouldn't want to see one of my own team doing it. It's not good sportsmanship. Someone without passion for the game might say it is. When you play a derby game, you don't just play on the day, there is a build-up in the week and everyone is on edge. ‘You build yourself into a frenzy where you despise the opposition. At the end of the game you shake hands with everyone, you wouldn't smile.’ Carragher was backed up by his ex-Liverpool team-mate Danny Murphy, who said: 'He shouldn't have done that, you do that at the end of the game. That was out of order.' But Krul countered: 'What I actually thought, I probably can't repeat because it wasn't nice. 'It was a fantastic goal and everyone accepts that, but what I actually thought was more in the region of “what a lucky guy he is”, but with a bit more venom behind it. ‘I've been at this club for 10 years and I'm as hurt as anybody else, so whoever wants to put this negative light on me, it's not justified. 'I'm a Geordie. I've been here 10 years and I'm going home with a lot of pain in my heart. To see those travelling fans going back to Newcastle without a win again, it hurts me as much as them.' Defoe (left) hit a stunning volley on the cusp of half-time to give Sunderland the lead against Newcastle . Defoe celebrates his strike which helped the Black Cats to victory in the Wear-Tyne derby . Sunderland’s victory was their fifth on the spin in this fixture and moved them three points clear of the relegation zone. New boss Advocaat believes it has gone a long way to ensuring their safety. ‘I have always said we will survive, but we had to win today,’ said the 67-year-old, who will leave at the end of the season regardless of which division Sunderland are in. ‘There was a lot of pressure on the team but I got a great feeling when we arrived here on the bus. That was something special and the players felt that. Sunderland boss Dick Advocaat congratulates Defoe as he sends on Adam Johnson to replace the striker during the Wear-Tyne derby victory . Advocaat smiles as he looks on from his technical area at the Stadium of Light . The win is Sunderland's first under Advocaat and lifts them three points clear of the bottom three . Sunderland's victory took them above Aston Villa and Hull City in the Barclays Premier League table . ‘The league table looks better now, but the most important thing is May 24. It will look better if we’re here then. ‘I’m proud of the team and I’m proud of our fans.’ Meanwhile, an emotional Defoe hailed his strike as one of his finest. ‘It's one of my best - with my left foot as well,’ said the 32-year-old, ‘but even a tap-in would be massive in a game like this. ‘As the ball was dropping I was just concentrating on the strike. During the week I've done a lot of shooting and as soon as it left my foot I knew it was in. ‘It was an unbelievable feeling when it went in. I was very emotional for some reason, as everyone wanted the three points so badly.’
David Silva declared himself fit on Sunday night despite fears he had fractured his cheekbone after being caught in the face by Cheikhou Kouyate’s elbow. The Manchester City star was carried off in the win over West Ham following eight minutes of treatment on the pitch, where he was given oxygen. He went to hospital as a precaution but later posted on social media to ease fans’ worries, and the club announced on Monday that tests showed no fracture. David Silva (left) receives an elbow to the face by the on-rushing Cheikhou Kouyate in the second half . The Spaniard was caught right on the cheekbone and has been taken to hospital to be assessed . Silva turns around in pain before receiving several minutes treatment and being given oxygen . ‘Many thanks to all the messages of support, all the tests have gone well and I’m already home. The three points is what was important!’ he tweeted. Kouyate was only booked by referee Anthony Taylor and City boss Manuel Pellegrini believes the Senegal midfielder did not mean to injure his player. ‘I always think that a player doesn’t want to damage another player,’ he said. ‘The referee was so near and he decided it was unintentional. ‘He decides what happens and gave a yellow card. I hope that it was an accidental collision. ‘At this moment Silva is in hospital and they are checking if he has a broken bone in his cheek. It looked serious but we must wait for what happens at the hospital.’ Asked if Silva has been knocked unconscious, Pellegrini added: ‘I don’t know. The doctor has some doubts about that. After that he recovers well so we are checking.’ West Ham manager Sam Allardyce claimed that the incident was ‘accidental’, saying: ‘It was innocuous. I didn’t think it was a foul. ‘Everybody thinks it is more serious attack from Cheikhou than it was. ‘It wasn’t deliberate at all. He has no idea, it has happened from behind him. I have seen the reaction from the video on the laptop.’ Silva was given put in a neck brace and given oxygen as his concerned team-mates looked on . City bounced back from their defeat in the Manchester derby to win 2-0 through James Collins’s own-goal and Sergio Aguero’s 20th Premier League strike of the season. Pellegrini’s side are now one point behind third-placed Manchester United, who lost at leaders Chelsea on Saturday, in the race for a top-four finish and seven clear of Liverpool in fifth. ‘I think it was very important for our team to win,’ said the City boss. ‘We were coming from two defeats in a row, and always when one is a derby it is worse.’ After seeing the Hammers fail to win for the 10th time in 11 games, Allardyce said: ‘The most disappointing thing was the goals we gifted City. The two mistakes we make for the goals, one was pretty bizarre and the other unexpected from a player as experienced as Stewart Downing.’ The loss of Silva will be a big blow to Manchester City if his facial injury is as serious as first feared . Silva was taken off on a stretcher before being rushed to hospital as Manuel Pellegrini has a nervous wait . Jamie Carragher believes the FA have no option but to look into the incident. 'I think they will look at it. It's one of those where no one knows but him if he meant to do it. It was like when Costa stamped on Skrtel. 'Nobody can say 100 per cent, only he knows but you know as players, there are certain challenges or when you're running past someone you think - I can get away with this. 'I think he's gone past and gone I'll leave one on Silva and I'll put my hands up like I never meant it. You couldn't prove it but it doesn't look good and should have been a red card.'
Mark Selby was straight into an auspicious groove as he began his title defence at the Betfred World Championship on Saturday. The 31-year-old from Leicester rocked Ronnie O'Sullivan in last year's final to claim his maiden Crucible title, and returned to ease 6-3 ahead of Kurt Maflin in their first-round tussle. No first-time champion in Sheffield has returned to retain the trophy 12 months on, and that factor has taken the tag of the 'Crucible curse'. Mark Selby plays a shot in the first round match against Kurt Maflin on day one of the World Championship . Mark Selby and Norwegian Kurt Maflin look on during their first round match at the Crucible in Sheffield . Selby salutes the Crucible crowd on his arrival . Selby is equipped with the form to be a repeat winner, having lifted the German Masters and China Open titles this year, and breaks of 84, 108, 53, 69 and 56 gave him a commanding lead to take into the evening session. His match with Maflin concludes on Saturday, the only clash to reach a finish on day one of the tournament, and Selby looked like being too strong for his London-born opponent who currently represents Norway, where he has lived for more than a decade. Maflin defeated Steve Davis in the qualifying stages, and he beat Selby in Germany last year, but this was a Crucible debut for the 31-year-old. Selby, despite being just two months older than Maflin, is an old hand at the tournament, having made his first World Championship appearance 10 years ago. They shared the four frames before the mid-session interval, Maflin making runs of 96 and 60, before Selby opened a two-frame lead and then also claimed the seventh after a re-spotted black. It looked a pivotal frame, as Maflin twice attempted to double in the black but on the second occasion left Selby a long pot, which he fired assuredly into the centre of the pocket. Selby match against Maflin concludes on Saturday, the only clash to finish on day one of the tournament . Back came Maflin with an 88 break, but when Selby bustled through the last of the session he had a commanding advantage to take into the concluding session, needing just four more frames to reach the second round. Hong Kong cueman Marco Fu took the final frame of the session with a break of 66 to nudge 5-4 in front of Bexhill's Jimmy Robertson. Robertson was mauled 10-1 by Selby when making his World Championship debut four years ago, but after qualifying for the second time was making a stronger fist this time. The 28-year-old Englishman briefly threatened to make a 147 maximum break, which would have been the 11th in the tournament's history, but missed the 11th red in the fifth frame.
In-form Lazio will have an extra spring in their step when they take to the Stadio Olimpico pitch to face Empoli on Sunday. The Roman outfit clinched a spot in the final of the Coppa Italia on Wednesday with 1-0 victory over Napoli, a result which sealed a 2-1 triumph on aggregate. They will now face Juventus in the Coppa final on June 7. And defender Mauricio managed to capture the celebrations of the Lazio supporters using a selfie stick after they secured their progression.

Senad Lulic, the Lazio midfielder who scored the winning goal on Wednesday, said to Gazzetta dello Sport: 'It was important to reach the final. 'Juve are the strongest team in Italy but I think if we continue to play as we are doing we will have a chance in the final.' Lazio will try to win for the eighth consecutive game in Serie A this weekend. They are third in the standings, 15 points behind Juve but just one point adrift of Roma.

Juve go into Saturday's game at bottom-side Parma after one of their most impressive performances of the season. Massimo Allegri's side hit back from a first-leg defeat with a 3-0 triumph at Fiorentina to reach the Coppa final.
A war hero pilot who survived almost 70 skirmishes with the Luftwaffe has died after being knocked down by a hit-and-run driver near his home. Doug Gregory, 92, had popped out for his daily newspaper when he was struck by a car outside a petrol station. The ex-Spitfire pilot suffered a serious head injury and was flown to hospital by air ambulance, but died two weeks later. A hero: Doug Gregory. 92, only retired from his job as a stunt pilot two years ago. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross after surviving almost 70 missions over Nazi-occupied Europe . Fighter pilot: The 92-year-old had survived 70 missions against the Luftwaffe during the Second World War. He flew Beaufighters and Mosquitoes before testing  aircraft, including models of Spitfires and Hurricanes . Mr Gregory began flying during the Second World War and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for his gallantry in 69 combat missions over Nazi-occupied Europe. Having volunteered for the Royal Air Force as early as he could, straight after his 18th birthday in 1941, Mr Gregory flew Beaufighters and Mosquitoes. He also tested a wide range of aircraft, including Spitfires and Hurricanes. A veteran of D-Day, the RAF’s Battle of Berlin bombing campaign and night sorties all over Europe, he recalled years later: ‘I wasn’t shot down but I was shot at. Luckily they missed – most of the time.’ Mr Gregory also survived a brain haemorrhage in 1947. He only retired from his role as a stunt pilot at the age of 90. Mr Gregory was performing loop-the-loops throughout his 80s – earning the nickname The Flying Zimmer – as a founder member of the Great War Display Team, a band of pilots determined to preserve the spirit and skills of Britain’s First World War dogfighter heroes. Knocked down: The war hero was making his daily trip to the shops and had just purchased a newspaper when he was struck. Officers are still investigating the collision but say no-one has been arrested or charged . Hit-and-run: Police at the scene where Mr Gregory was knocked down by a car. Officers say a female motorist driving a silver-coloured Nissan involved in the collision came forward and was interviewed under caution . The accident happened on March 30 just after he had bought a paper at his local newsagent’s in Blackfield, Hampshire. His wife and son accompanied him to Southampton General Hospital, where he died on Sunday. Police said a woman who was driving a silver-coloured Nissan involved in the accident later came forward and was interviewed under caution. A police spokesman said officers were still investigating the accident. He added that no one had been arrested or charged in connection with the collision. Last night tributes poured in. Military historian Paul Beaver tweeted: ‘Deep regret at passing of Doug Gregory, night intruder veteran & honorary member of Army Flying Association. Our thoughts with Liz & family.’ Another fan tweeted: ‘RIP Doug Gregory DFC a great former Mosquito and display pilot. Blue skies, Sir. Very sad news.’ Mr Gregory's love of flying continued after the war. He built a 1917-style bi-plane and joined the Great War Display Team, eventually becoming Britain's oldest stunt pilot until he decided to give up his role in 2013 . Teacher: After leaving the RAF in 1946 Mr Gregory (left) became an art teacher at two Hampshire schools. Police said no-one had been arrested or charged in connection with the collision in Blackfield (right) When he gave up his role as a stunt pilot in 2013 Mr Gregory insisted he would still continue to fly planes . Mr Gregory left the RAF in 1946 and spent the rest of his working life teaching art in a Hampshire comprehensive. But on his retirement, aged 60, he wanted to do something more than garden and play golf, so he used his £5,000 savings to spend four years building himself the 1917-style SE5A biplane that he flew in airshows. He joined the Great War Display Team, saying: ‘Flying has been my favourite thing all my life, especially aerobatics. I don’t do any other kind of sport. Flying is quite enough to keep me going.’ Determined to teach younger generations of the bravery of the First World War pilots, he said in 2007: ‘I am afraid that the public’s grasp of history today is pathetic. 'If we can help people understand a bit more about what happened in the Great War, then it has to be worthwhile.’ In 2010, Mr Gregory and some of his fellow pilots took part in a mock dogfight over the New Forest to celebrate the centenary of the former Royal Fying Corps airfield at East Boldre. He finally quit flying in 2013, saying of his beloved biplane: ‘I will miss it terribly, but it is difficult to get in and out of and very hard to start.’

Roy Keane, Republic of Ireland assistant manager, pictured during a Euro 2016 qualifier on March 29 . Former Manchester United footballer Roy Keane will stand trial over an alleged road-rage incident with a taxi driver. The 43-year-old has denied committing a public order offence after it was claimed he behaved aggressively towards driver Fateh Kerar, 44, near traffic lights in Altrincham, Cheshire. He did not attend a brief hearing at Trafford Magistrates' Court today but a not guilty plea was entered on his behalf by his lawyer following the incident on January 30. He is accused of causing harassment, alarm or distress to Altrincham-based Mr Kerar - a Section 4A Public Order offence. The court heard the prosecution will call two witnesses - understood to be Mr Kerar and a taxi passenger - while the defence will call Keane and an additional witness. No CCTV of the incident was captured, the court also heard. Keane will face trial at Manchester Magistrates' Court on June 19. Keane, from Hale, Cheshire, enjoyed a trophy-laden career at Old Trafford and also played for Nottingham Forest and Celtic. He won seven Premier League titles, as well as four FA Cups and one Champions League. The TV football pundit managed Sunderland and Ipswich Town and was assistant boss at Aston Villa before he quit to concentrate on a similar role he holds with the Republic of Ireland's national team.

As someone who suffers from computer eye strain, I was alarmed to discover that prolonged exposure to gadgets such as iPhones and iPads can cause irreversible damage to the eyes. A Spanish expert, Dr Celia Sanchez-Ramos, has found the LED screens found in most electronic devices can harm the retina - the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye - and may even lead to partial blindness. Research has already shown that the intense levels of 'blue light' emitted from modern gadgets can cause a variety of health complaints, ranging from sleeping and eating problems to headaches and even cancer. Scroll down for video . LED screens found in most electronic devices such as iPhones and tablets can harm the retina - the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye - and may even lead to partial blindness, a doctor has warned . Now, Dr Sanchez-Ramos has discovered that it can also permanently damage the retina. In extreme cases, she says, it may even lead to macular degeneration, which causes dark patches to appear in the centre of the field of vision. According to Dr Sanchez-Ramos, modern LED screens, produced from about 2007 onwards, emit up to five times as much blue light as older technology. This matches my own experience, in which pre-2007 screens tend not to cause discomfort. The average adult now spends up to eight-and-a-half hours in front of a screen every day, and it is not uncommon to be exposed to multiple screens at once. For these reasons, says Dr Sanchez-Ramos, who is based at Complutense University in Madrid, the majority of people are likely to be in the danger zone. Children and the elderly are most at risk on account of their delicate eyes, as well as 'digital workers' and those - like me - who are especially sensitive to blue light. Dr Sanchez-Ramos (pictured) said: 'Never before in human history have we exposed our eyes to light that is so intense, for such long periods, from such an early age' 'Never before in human history have we exposed our eyes to light that is so intense, for such long periods, from such an early age,' she says. 'People who suffer from eye strain are like the canaries in the mineshaft, as they are aware of the damage being done. But it can affect anybody.' The damage, she explains, starts when the photoreceptors - types of neurone found in the retina that convert light into information - begin to die out due to the prolonged saturation of blue light. This puts strain on other parts of the eye, leading to increasing levels of inflammation, discomfort and pain. Eventually, the concentration of blue light in the centre of the retina, an area known as the macula, may cause it to be permanently damaged, leading to visual disorders. However the problem can be remedied by using special screen filters or glasses designed to block blue light, which are available through opticians. Daniel Hardiman-McCartney, clinical adviser at the College of Optometrists, says: 'It has been proven that intense exposure to blue light kills cells in the retina, and it is a perfectly reasonable possibility that it can cause macular degeneration over a period of time. 'More research is needed to prove it to the scientific standard. We need to conduct studies on a large number of people over a long period of time. 'But the proposal is of great interest.' Dr Sanchez-Ramos carried out experiments at the University of Madrid in which human retinal cells, taken from volunteers, were exposed to cycles of LED light of different intensities. She found that exposure to intense blue light caused apoptosis, or cell death. However this was reduced by 83 per cent when a special protective filter was placed between the cells and the light. Based on this research, she designed a screen filter called ' Reticare ', which converts harmful blue light to a gentler frequency more akin to sunshine. Dr Sanchez-Ramos found that exposure to intense blue light caused cell death in the eye. However this was reduced by 83 per cent when a special protective filter was placed between the cells and the light . Her findings prompted her to design a screen filter called ' Reticare ', which converts harmful blue light to a gentler frequency more akin to sunshine . Other treatments are also available. In 2013, Barnard Levit optometrists in London, who are specialists in the field, tested my eyes using a machine called a Colorimeter. Following this, they designed a pair of glasses with a blue tint, which blocked the most harmful part of the colour spectrum. The harmful effects of exposure to gadgets is linked to the high levels of 'blue light', also known as 'short wavelength light', that is emitted by modern screens. According to researchers at Harvard Medical School , 'not all colours of light have the same effect'. In particular, blue wavelengths, which are emitted by most electronic devices produced from 2007 onwards, have been shown to have 'adverse health effects'. Modern LED screens emit up to five times as much blue light as older technology. Researchers have found that using an electronic gadget with a backlit display for just two hours can affect the production of melatonin - the chemical that controls our body clock - and cause sleep problems, particularly in teenagers. A study at Chicago's Northwestern University revealed that prolonged exposure to blue light stimulated the sensation of hunger, even directly after meals, making it a contributor to weight gain and obesity. And experts at the University of Connecticut found a link between cancer and the use of gadgets that emit blue light in the evenings and by night. In addition, Dr Sanchez-Ramos has found that exposure to blue light can damage the retina causing macular degeration, or partial blindness. Children and young adults are at greater risk, as they lack the natural protection against blue light that the human eye naturally acquires. The effects can be reduced by the use of protective filters or spectacles. Prior to this, I had been unable to use iPhones, iPads and other gadgets with LED screens without shooting pain in my eyes, dizziness and nausea. This condition is known as Meares-Irlen syndrome or 'visual stress'. It is thought to be caused by hypersensitivity to particular frequencies of light, whether blue, red or green. In response, the visual cortex - the part of the brain responsible for processing visual information - generates too much electrical activity. This spills over into different areas of the brain, causing a variety of symptoms. About 10 per cent of people with dyslexia are thought to have visual stress. It can also be found in those with autism, ADHD, migraine, photo-sensitive epilepsy and multiple sclerosis, as well as stroke victims. Unusually for a sufferer of the condition, I have none of the related conditions listed above. When I used the blue glasses, however, I found that my eye pain, dizziness and nausea all but disappeared when using LED screens. I later discovered the glasses did not work with every type of screen, possibly because some emit different frequencies of harmful light. When I road-tested one of Dr Sanchez-Ramos' filters, I found my symptoms were reduced significantly on all devices, though the blue spectacles were more effective with certain screens. Dr Sanchez-Ramos says the use of LED screens has become so ubiquitous in such a short period of time that in 20 years' time, severe eye problems could become widespread. She and her colleagues are lobbying Apple, Samsung and other technology manufacturers to make their screens friendlier to the eye, meaning that no protective filters would be needed. This, she says, is an uphill struggle because super-bright screens make more of an impact on the customer, which encourages sales. She has also been putting pressure on various European governments, on both a national and regional level. As a result, a number of Spanish local authorities have ruled that all schools under their jurisdiction must use protective screen filters. Reticare filters are now available online and cost between €12.95 and €49, depending on the size of the screen.
The federal government is looking to take a hard line with parents who choose not to vaccinate their children. Under ground breaking reforms, Social Services Minister Scott Morrison will reportedly scrap a provision that allows parents who don't vaccinate their children to claim welfare benefits, including $726 from Family Tax Benefit A, $7,500-a-year from childcare rebate and $200-a-week from the childcare benefit scheme. Scroll down for video . The government are about to annouce reforms that will strip parents of welfare benefits if they don't immunise their kids . Newscorp reported that Prime Minister Tony Abbott will announce the reforms alongside Mr Morrison on Sunday with the changes coming into full effect in January 2016. The controversial change could put millions of dollars back into the federal government's pocket. The way the system works now, children must be immunised to access childcare payments, however,  a 'contentious loop hole' means parents can avoid loosing their benefits by simply signing a form that says they object to immunisation based on 'personal, philosophical or religious' reasons. Mr Morrison recently said the rules around welfare payments need to be 'tightened' and that while immunising children against deadly diseases protects the wider society, it should be a prerequisite to receive tax payer money. 'We've got to think about the health and well-being of all the other children that are put at risk, and it's their health that also matters' 'We've got to think about the health and well-being of all the other children that are put at risk, and it's their health that also matters,' he said. 'And in fact, you know, those parents have taken decisions to immunise their children, and that's obviously the sensible thing to do. We're a free country, and we're for free society, but that doesn't mean you get to take taxpayers' money if you don't want to go along with the rules.' While doctors and pro-vaccination groups are tipped to welcome the reforms as a way to increase the number of children being vaccinated, some immunisation experts are worried the move won't bolster immunisation rates. Currently around 39,000 children under the age of seven are not vaccinated.

Labor leader Bill Shorten's support will be vital to get the changes through the Senate however he has already indicated there will be bipartisan support for the harsh provisions. He reportedly wrote to the Prime Minister on Friday expressing his concerns over the loophole. Riley Hughes died at just 32 days old after suffering complications arising from whooping cough . These reforms come amid rising concerns about whooping cough outbreaks that have devastated small communities where many children remain unvaccinated. The heartbroken parents of a beautiful four-week-old baby boy who died after contracting whooping cough have appealed to other parents to make sure they get themselves and their children immunised against the deadly disease. Greg and Catherine Hughes, from Perth, set up a Facebook page to honour their son Riley Hughes after he 'passed away peacefully in the arms of his mummy and daddy' at 2pm on March 17, aged just 32 days. 'Our greatest desire out of our own personal tragedy is to stop parents from having to endure the heartache of preventable childhood deaths,' Riley's dad Greg wrote on the Facebook page Light for Riley. The newborn, born on February 13, died in Perth's Princess Margaret Hospital as a result of pneumonia-based complications arising from whooping cough. Whooping cough is part of the routine vaccination schedule for babies at two months, four months and six months of age. Booster doses are given at 4 years and 10-15 years. The reforms come amid rising concerns about whooping cough outbreaks that have devastated small communities where many children remain unvaccinated . Infectious Diseases Expert at ANU Medical School Canberra, Sanjaya Senanayake, told Daily Mail Australia: 'From my point of view immunisation is wonderful particularly for whooping cough.' He explained infants are 'at a high risk of dying if they get infected' and that the death rate from whooping cough in infants under 6 months of age is about 1 per cent. The Department of Health said vaccinations protect more than 95 per cent of children from measles, mumps, rubella, tetanus, polio and Hib, given they finish their courses. 'One dose of meningococcal C vaccine at 12 months protects over 90 per cent of children. Three doses of whooping cough (pertussis) vaccine protects about 85 per cent of children who have been immunised, and will reduce the severity of the disease in the other 15 per cent if they do catch whooping cough.'
New York City police have released the image of a tattoo found on the body of a woman in hopes of identifying her nearly a month after she died on a Brooklyn street. The unnamed woman, believed to be between 25 and 45 years old, was discovered lying unconscious March 22 in the area near Shore Parkway and 26th Avenue in the Gravesend section of Brooklyn. Paramedics who responded to the scene were unable to revive her and she was pronounced dead that evening. Distinctive: NYPD has released images of a heart tattoo with the name 'Monique' found on an unnamed woman who died in Brooklyn last month. To the left is the body art as it appears on her leg. To the right is a tattoo artist's rendering of how the actual tattoo may have appeared originally . The deceased woman had no identification on her, but she sported a distinctive tattoo on her right leg. Investigators believe the faded body art was the name 'Monique' etched across a tattooed ribbon within a heart topped with a rose. NBC New York reported that police are still awaiting a medical examiner's report to find out the cause of the woman's death. Anyone with information about the unidentified woman is being asked to contact NYPD Crime Stoppers at 800-577-TIPS. Death in the street: The unnamed woman, believed to be 25 to 45 years old, was discovered lying unconscious March 22 in the area near Shore Parkway and 26th Avenue in the Gravesend section of Brooklyn .
Researchers sketching out a 'wiring diagram' for rat brains have discovered its structure is organized like the Internet. They say the animal's cerebral cortex is 'like a mini-Internet'. The first comprehensive picture of how neurons connect to one another found local networks of neurons layered like the shells in a Russian nesting doll. The Internet has countless local area networks that then connect with larger, regional networks and ultimately with the backbone of the Internet. The brain operates in a similar way, the researchers found. 'The cerebral cortex is like a mini-Internet,' said Larry Swanson, professor at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, and corresponding author of a paper on the discovery. 'The Internet has countless local area networks that then connect with larger, regional networks and ultimately with the backbone of the Internet. 'The brain operates in a similar way.' The study was published on April 6 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. For years, scientists looking for clues to brain function through its structure focused on what could be seen — the brain's lobes, grooves and folds. Two local networks — one governing vision and learning, and another tapped into bodily concerns like muscle and organ function — make up the inner shell of the rat's cerebral cortex. Two others — one governing smell, and another that assembles and makes sense of the information from the other three networks — make up the outer shell. This means that certain flows of information are genetically 'hardwired' into the brain, Swanson said. The discovery is the result of a massive, labor-intensive effort to organize 40 years' worth of data from peer-reviewed research articles detailing connections in rat brains. 'The data was already out there; it just needed to be compiled into a more useful format,' Swanson said. Lead author Mihail Bota of USC Dornsife created the database from more than 16,000 reports of connections, which he weighted both on the strength of the connection and the reliability of the methodology used to discover it. The process took more than 4,000 hours to complete, yielding a database that is free and available. Olaf Sporns of Indiana University subsequently performed a network analysis of the connections. A color-coded flat map of 1,923 rat cortical association macroconnections (RCAMs). The team used studies of rat brains because of the sheer volume of detailed information available. Swanson believes that the database can create an important link between human brain studies — which are largely done as non-invasive functional magnetic resonance imaging scans — and rat brain studies, which can be more in-depth. 'Having a wiring diagram for the brain will allow knowledge to flow both ways between human and animal studies,' Swanson said. 'This allows us to take theories from human brain scan studies and experimentally verify them in animals, and discoveries made in animal studies are likely to have an analogue in humans.' 'We're bridging the gap between our work in rat brains and the Stevens Institute's work with human brains,' Swanson said. 'If we can connect these two veins of neuroscience in a concrete and meaningful way, then we can dramatically expand our reservoir of information about the brain practically overnight.' In the future, Swanson hopes to be able to expand the neural-connection map of the rat brain beyond the cerebral cortex, some day mapping the entire nervous system.
The widow of US Navy SEAL Chris Kyle has revealed the painful moment she first broke the news to their two children that their father had been murdered. Taya Kyle told ABC's Robin Roberts she gathered her son, Colton and daughter, McKenna and prepared to tell them. 'I remembered just closing my eyes, the tears rolling down and me just trying to breathe,' said Kyle. Reveal: Taya Kyle had to do everything she could from falling apart in front of her kids when she explained to them their father had been killed . Recovery: Taya has given an interview to 20/20s Robin Roberts about her life since Eddie Ray Routh was convicted of killing her husband, American Sniper, Chris Kyle . Taya, 40, was speaking to Roberts for a special edition of ABC News' 20/20 which will air on Friday, May 1 and will catch up with the widow of Kyle, whose story is portrayed in the blockbuster movie, American Sniper. It will be the first in-depth interview that Kyle has given since former Marine Eddie Ray Routh was found guilty of capital murder on February 24 for shooting dead Chris Kyle and his friend, Chad Littlefield. He was automatically handed a life sentence without the possibility of parole and Taya Kyle broke down in tears on the stand when she gave evidence on the first day of the trial. During the course of their interview, Kyle jokes with Roberts that she never thought she would marry 'a cowboy' but was 'excited' by falling in love with him. 'I never probably thought a cowboy would want me,' she said. 'And I said I would never marry somebody -- a SEAL either. So… 'there you go with your plans again,' right?' Family: Chris Kyle (pictured unshaven) proudly poses with his son, Colton and daughter, Mckenna and wife Taya after leaving active service  in around 2012 . Taxing and emotional testimony: Taya Kyle wipes the tears from her eyes as she gives evidence from the stand during the trial of Chris Kyle's killer, Eddie Ray Routh in February . Eddie Ray Routh pleaded not guilty to killing Chris Kyle and said that he shot him and his friend Chad Littlefield dead because he was suffering PTSD. The jury decided he was guilty of murder and knew what he was doing . Taya has also written a new book, 'American Wife: A Memoir of Love, War, Faith and Renewal' which will go into detail about her marriage and the aftermath of Chris's death. The book is released on May 4 and Taya hopes it will draw a line under her recent events. In March, Taya published a heartbreaking letter to mark their 13th wedding anniversary. Taya Kyle pledged to love her late husband 'all the days of my life' in the touching tribute in which she described the moment her future husband gave her two dozen roses during one of their first dates. Kyle, who was the subject of last year's Clint Eastwood-directed movie American Sniper, was gunned down by fellow war veteran Eddie Ray Routh at a shooting range in Rough Creek, Texas, on February 2, 2013. Taya Kyle was the first witnesses called during the trial. The judge also allowed her to attend the public gallery afterwards to watch the trial . American Sniper: Eddie Ray Routh shot Chris Kyle dead in February of 2013. In February of 2015 he was found guilty for the death of the war hero . That day, Kyle had offered to help Routh deal with his post traumatic stress disorder but was instead shot dead along with his friend Chad Littlefield. Now, in the wake of a turbulent year that involved her husband's killer's trial and an appearance at the Academy Awards for the film made in his name, Mrs Kyle has written of her enduring love for her husband. Posted on Facebook in March, her letter said: 'I feel you in my heart and soul so strongly. I am more blessed to have been your wife than anything else in my life. 'Today, I am thinking of our new relationship, when you rented a boutique hotel room in San Diego and surprised me with two dozen long stem pink roses when we arrived. You got us tickets to a local improv type play. I knew then I was the luckiest girl in the world to be with tough, romantic, loving you. 'Today, I have a choice. I can bury myself under the covers and acknowledge the pain of missing you and mourn the future anniversaries without you. Or, I can celebrate never having a day without you in my heart because you loved me enough to leave me a lifetime of memories and beauty. 'I am somewhere in between today. I loved you yesterday, I love you know, and I will love you all the days of my life.' Kyle was considered the deadliest sniper in American history, with his kill count thought to number about 160 confirmed, with many more probable kills.
Two Florida women who are in a relationship and worked at the same daycare center are fighting to get their jobs back after they were fired for being gay. Jaclyn Pfeiffer, 29, worked at the Aloma Methodist Early Childhood Learning Center in Orange County full-time for the last 18 months, while her partner, Kelly Bardier, 33, was recently employed as a part-time teacher. The two have been together since October. However they were both terminated after the director, Barbara Twachtman, heard rumors about the two and asked Pfeiffer whether she was seeing Bardier . 'I feel like if a person can do their job, gay, straight or whatever, they should be able to work and do their job that they love to do,' Pfieffer told Click Orlando. Fired for being gay: According to Jaclyn Pfeiffer, 29 (left), rumors of her sexual orientation began to circulate after her girlfriend, Kelly Bardier, 33 (right), took a job in another part of the school as a substitute teacher . Termination: Even though the couple insisted they had tried to keep their relationship private, the director of Aloma Methodist Early Childhood Learning Center fired both of them because of their sexuality . School: Aloma Methodist Early Childhood Learning Center receives $2,442 in taxpayer funding per child from the state of Florida for providing voluntary prekindergarten (VPK) during the school year . 'I never thought they would actually fire me for being gay.' Bardier added that she was given the option to 'change her lifestyle' to keep her position. The daycare is run by Aloma United Methodist Church. In a statement, the church said they 'felt the need' to let both women go. 'We can say decisions regarding their employment involve long-standing local church policies intended to reflect the beliefs and values of this congregation,' Gretchen Hastings, director of communications for the Florida Conference UMC, said in a statement to Click Orlando. 'These are policies applicable to all employees. Our church continues to be in prayer for all of those affected.' Together: Jaclyn Pfeiffer, 29, and Kelly Bardier, 33, seen here at Disney World, have been together since October last year . However Pfieffer and Bardier are hitting back. They content they were unaware of the church's stance against gays when they accepted their jobs. They have now hired a lawyer, Mary Meeks, who maintains that religious freedom does not mean workers can be fired because of their sexual orientation. They have threatened to sue Aloma United Methodist Church if they do not reinstate Pfieffer and Barider and offer an apology by  April 15. According to The Orlando Sentinel, a resolution passed in 2008 states that the church opposes 'all forms of violence or discrimination based on gender, gender identity, sexual practice or sexual orientation'. Strict: Despite the state funding, Aloma Methodist broke no state or federal laws when the couple's employment was terminated, they maintain . After the two were fired, Twatchman emailed parents saying Pfeiffer, who is well-like by the two-year-olds she cares for, had decided to leave for 'personal reasons'. Twatchman added she had been a 'wonderful teacher' who was 'gifted with children'. 'I am very sad that she is leaving,' the email said, according to The Sentinel. Unemployed: Jaclyn Pfeiffer and Kelly Bardier say they were terminated from their jobs at Aloma Methodist Early Childhood Learning Center after the school discovered they were in a relationship .
Two mothers who dramatically rescued a baby and group of young girls from rising tides were horrified to discover onlookers filming the incident instead of helping them. An 18-month-old baby and three girls - aged three, six and eight - were trapped on a sandbank at Blackpool Beach while out walking during the school break. But when it was obvious they had found themselves in trouble, those perched on the nearby pier did nothing to help - instead, they took out their smartphones to record the drama. Two mothers saved the lives of three girls and a baby after the youngsters were trapped by the rising tide . The Mirror reported the two mothers held the baby and young girls' heads above the rising tide until volunteer lifeboats reached them. Lifeboat crew member Nathan Lee told the paper: 'They thought they were going to die. One mum was disgusted people were filming it all on cameras, not helping. 'A few more minutes and none of them would be here.' The incident serves as just another reminder of the dangers of rising tides after more than 60 spectators had to be rescued at the Boat Race in London on Saturday. Lifeboats were deployed to transport the onlookers from the shore after they became trapped on the edge of the River Thames. Video footage showed a group of at least 40 people stranded by the rising waters after watching the rowing race between Oxford and Cambridge universities. A boy, reportedly eight years old, was also rescued from an embankment after he became separated from his mother, while seven people were evacuated from Chiswick Eyot when they were cut off by the rising tide. The RNLI said it was a 'surprise' to find so many spectators in trouble and the number was 'significantly greater' than in previous years. Many were unaware that they would be exposed to the substantial wash from the flotilla following the races and from the rising tide, it said. As a result many were cut off and found themselves with limited options to reach higher ground. Chiswick RNLI station manager Wayne Bellamy said: 'This incident showed once more that the tidal Thames can catch people unaware.' Spectators line the banks of the River Thames to watch the BNY Mellon Boat Race in London on Saturday .
John Carver has labelled Moussa Sissoko's reckless lunge on Lucas as 'indefensible' as the Newcastle boss refused to make excuses for his captain. The midfielder was sent off for two bookings in the 2-0 defeat at Liverpool Sunday night, but he could've seen a straight red after he caught Lucas on the ankle. The defeat was Newcastle's fifth in succession and left them with work still to do to ensure they do not get pulled into the relegation battle. Moussa Sissoko lunges in and makes a terrible tackle on Liverpool midfielder Lucas . The 25-year-old was sent off for a second bookable offence during Newcastle's defeat at Anfield . Carver admitted Sissoko could easily have been shown a straight red, pulling no punches. He said: 'The sending off, it could have been a straight red, I will be honest. I have said that to Moussa, I am quite straight and I won't defend anyone if it is indefensible.' Asked if Sissoko could be fined, Carver said: 'I am sure there will be some kind of disciplinary procedure. I said before the game we needed to keep 11 players.' Lucas goes down in pain after Sissoko's nasty challenge at Anfield on Monday night . Newcastle manager John Carver labelled Sissoko's tackle as 'indefensible' While Carver did not complain about that decision, he was angry that Ayoze Perez did not earn a penalty after apparently being felled by Dejan Lovren. He said: 'The game hinged on a huge decision. I don't want to be seen to be a moaner but it is fact we don't get big decisions for whatever reasons, it could be me. I have spoken to the referee, but it doesn't help me.' Carver did see reason for some optimism, feeling that his side's performance was much improved from their derby loss to Sunderland last time out. Sissoko is given his marching orders by referee Lee Mason after picking up two yellow cards . He said: 'I thought the first nine minutes we were very tentative, nervous after our performance against Sunderland. It was a bad goal to concede. 'After that we grew into the game. It is easy to crumble at Anfield but we didn't. One or two guys rolled their sleeves up. 'I think we got a response. We didn't get a result but I saw enough. 'There are lot of positives to take from the game. A lot of people expected us to get a hiding and I think we held our own for the majority of the game.'
She's just days away from giving birth but, as ever, the Duchess of Cambridge refused to let her style icon status slip during her second pregnancy. Rather than  swaddling her growing bump  under baggy dresses, the 33-year-old dressed to impress every time she stepped out. But while Mulberry coats and Alexander McQueen gowns did creep in, much of Kate's pregnancy wardrobe came from the High Street. Scroll down for video . Favourites: Hobbs, Seraphine and ASOS have all been worn repeatedly during the pregancy . From a £35 ASOS polka-dot dress to  Seraphine shifts, the Duchess is proof that you don't have to splash out to look gorgeous while expecting. Leading the High Street charge to the Duchess of Cambridge's wardrobe is Hobbs, a mid-range label that has taken her through everything from glamorous evening events to international tours. So enamoured is Kate of the brand, even Zara, of which she was once a die-hard fan, has had to make way for it, although another budget favourite, L.K Bennett,  also remains a favourite. 'The Duchess of Cambridge likes to play it quite safe when it comes to her wardrobe, pre and post-baby, and Hobbs is the perfect brand for her,' explains fashion pundit Simon Glazin. Hobbs: A £160 shirt dress (left) in January and, right, in a peplum top at a Place2Be event in November . 'Not only is it uber British, with everything designed in-house in London, it also dovetails with royal fashion protocol: not too revealing, neutral colours, and affordable.' The Duchess wore a brown shirt dress from Hobbs to visit foster carers in North London in January and a delicate polka dot velvet top by the brand for a Place2Be reception at Kensington Palace in November. On that occasion, she deployed one of her favourite styling tricks and combined the budget top with a glamorous silk skirt by Jenny Packham for maximum effect. But while she championed Hobbs on several occasions during her second pregnancy, it is by no means the only high street staple in Kate's wardrobe. Spot the Duchess! Kate in a £169 Hobbs Dalmatian coat in March that was first seen in 2013, right . The brunette royal is also a huge fan of a small Anglo-French label called Séraphine, which has grown from a small shop in 2002 to the A-list favourite it is today. The Duchess is the brand's most famous fan, having repeatedly chosen the label during both her pregnancies. Along with a £195 coat worn in January and a £95 blue and green floral dress sported to visit the Potteries in February, she also opted for the brand when making her début in New York. On that occasion, it was the glamorous £225 plum boucle Marina coat that was chosen - and true to form, the design has since sold out repeatedly. Séraphine is the brainchild of French expat Cecile Reinaud, who launched the brand in 2002 from a small shop on High Street Kensington, and is no doubt thrilled with the royal endorsement. In March, on a visit to ITV drama Downton Abbey, Kate wore a chic cream coat from high street maternity label, JoJo Maman Bébé. She has also sported a shirt dress from Jaeger and £99 print dress by Alice Temperley during her pregnancy. Cosy: Kate in a £275 Seraphine Maternity Marina coat with Prince William in New York in December last year . Séraphine: Kate in a £195 coat in January and, right, wearing a £59 Vanessa dress in December . Thanks to the much-marked Kate effect, everything she has worn has swiftly sold out. 'One of the reasons for her enduring sartorial popularity is the accessibility of her wardrobe,' explains Glazin. 'It's very real. Very practical. People can relate to her through her wardrobe, which is a clever move from her and her people. 'Nothing is out of reach, and she does wear a lot from the British High Street, which is great to see. It allows people to copy her head-to-toe. People want her hair, her make-up and now her wardrobe. 'People want someone to look up to when it comes to the royals. She is the new generation. 'She, more than any other royal, has made fashion achievable for the public. Diana had an amazing wardrobe but she wore a lot of made-to-measure pieces. 'She's quite safe with her wardrobe, which makes it even more accessible.' Good look: Kate wore a £250 blue Jaegar tile-print shirt dress in a video message supporting mental health . Chic: Kate in a £69 JoJo Maman Bebe maternity coat and, right, in a £35 ASOS polka-dot dress in March .
Scotland will definitely become independent one day, Nicola Sturgeon vowed today as she again refused to rule out a second referendum on breaking up the Union. The SNP leader said the 'direction of travel' was towards independence, as she set out her demands for her to support Ed Miliband if Labour falls short of a majority. But David Cameron warned of the 'frightening' prospect of the SNP holding Labour to ransom and demanding they ditch new roads and hospitals in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Scroll down for video . SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said the 'direction of travel' was towards independence butPrime Minister David Cameron warned nationalists would use a Labour government to break up the Union and punish other nations . The Tories have unveiled a new poster showing Nicola Sturgeon pulling Ed Miliband's strings, which could mean more taxes and borrowing, while England, Wales and Northern ireland suffer . David Cameron has urged people to vote tactically, to keep a Labour-SNP government out of power. The Prime Minister issued a plea to Ukip and Lib Dem voters to lend their support to the Tories to prevent 'Ed Miliband, propped up by Nicola Sturgeon demanding ever more borrowing and more taxes'. Writing in the Sunday Times, the Tory leader said: 'A vote for any of the other parties makes it harder for Conservatives to get those 23 constituencies we need to form a majority government. 'Vote for Ukip or the Liberal Democrats and you take Ed Miliband and Nicola Sturgeon a step closer to Downing Street — and our government, economy and country a step closer to chaos. 'So if you are considering voting Ukip or Lib Dem, I urge you to think of the chaos of a weak Ed Miliband, propped up by Nicola Sturgeon demanding ever more borrowing and more taxes. Only a Conservative vote in your local constituency will keep Ed Miliband and the SNP out and secure Britain's future.' Mr Cameron warned that with the SNP calling the shots, the rest of the United Kingdom – England, Wales, Northern Ireland, 'wouldn't get a look-in'. Both Mr Miliband and Ms Sturgeon have ruled out a formal coalition, with SNP ministers sitting in a Labour Cabinet. But Ms Sturgeon has repeatedly offered to work with Labour to 'lock' the Tories out of power. In September's referendum, 55 per cent of people voted against independence, but since then support for the SNP has soared. Latest polls suggest more than half of Scots plan to vote for the SNP, robbing Labour of dozens of seats north of the border. On BBC One's Andrew Marr Show, Ms Sturgeon would only say: 'I have no plans for another referendum at this stage.' But she added: 'I think Scotland will become an independent country one day. I think that's the direction of travel. 'Whether there is another referendum, and whether Scotland becomes independent is not a matter for me to decide. It is a matter for the Scottish people to decide.' Ms Sturgeon tried to play down the idea that the SNP would attempt to cause disruption at Westminster to further its goal of independence. 'I've got to persuade people that the SNP in the House of Commons after the election will not be any kind of disruptive force. We want to be constructive, to get better politics coming out of the Westminster system. 'As long as Scotland remains part of the Westminster system, it matters to people that we get good decisions out of that system, and I want the SNP to play a positive part in improving politics at Westminster for people right across the UK.' But Mr Cameron warned that if Labour is forced to rely on the SNP to pass laws and budgets, England, Wales and Northern Ireland will pay the price. Ms Sturgeon tried to play down the idea that the SNP would attempt to cause disruption at Westminster to further its goal of independence . Mr Cameron warned that with the SNP calling ths shots, the rest of the United Kingdom – England, Wales, Northern Ireland, wouldn't get a look-in . The Prime Minister, who described himself as a 'fundamental believer in the United Kingdom', told Andrew Marr: 'This would be the first time on our history that a group of nationalists from one part of our country would be involved in altering the direction of the government of our country. I think that is a frightening prospect. 'People thinking in their own constituencies, is that bypass going to be built, will my hospital get the money it needs? Frankly this is a group of people that wouldn't care about what happened in the rest of the country. 'The rest of the United Kingdom – England, Wales, Northern Ireland, wouldn't get a look-in. 'That is the prospect we face if we don't get the majority Conservative government that is in our reach.' A recent TNS survey showed the SNP has almost doubled its lead over Labour in a month, with 52 per cent now backing Ms Sturgeon with only 24 per cent of Scots planning to vote for Mr Miliband . Last week Labour announced plans for a freeze in rail fares, paid for by scrapping road upgrades on the A27 along the south coast and the A358 in Somerset - both in Tory and Lib Dem seats. Mr Cameron said: 'The SNP is a party that doesn't want to come to Westminster to contribute to a government, it wants to come to Westminster to break up our country. 'You have to ask yourself, if you are in a voter in England, in Wales or in Northern Ireland, would these people care at all about what happens in my life or my constituency. And the answer is no. 'We have already seen Labour cancelling important infrastructure projects, in the south of England, in the South West of England, the A27… . 'They've said we wouldn't go ahead with those, they've cancelled, they've said we don't care about these things because they don't matter to us politically. 'Imagine what it would be like with SNP MPs.'
Blackpool are in talks to sign Austria defender Thomas Piermayr. The 25-year-old has been training with the Championship club this week and they are keen to get him on board for what is expected to be confirmed as a campaign in League One next season. Piermayr is a free agent and had been playing for Colorado Rapids. The former Austria U21 international had a spell with Inverness Caledonian Thistle in 2011.

Prosecutors have been accused of losing a Nissan Micra at the centre of a double murder case. Timothy Crook is alleged to have murdered his elderly parents Bob, 90, and Elsie, 83, and then driven their bodies 150 miles before dumping them. But the grey car he is accused of using to transport the bodies has been lost, Bristol Crown Court was told. Prosecutors have been accused of losing a Nissan Micra (similar to the one shown here) at the centre of a double murder case . Timothy Crook (pictured) is alleged to have murdered his elderly parents Bob, 90, and Elsie, 83, and then driven their bodies 150 miles in a grey Nissan Micra . Sarah Jones, representing Crook, 50, said the blunder could have forensic consequences for his case. Crook is accused of killing his parents at their home in Swindon in July 2007 and then driving their bodies to Lincoln, where they used to live. Ms Jones told Judge Neil Ford QC at a preliminary hearing: 'The car in which the bodies were transported to Lincoln has been lost. 'That may have forensic consequences. We have some forensic angles being looked at. 'I have simply been told the Crown don't know where the car is. If it is not available it would be of help to have an identical model. 'It was a particular model which we believe did not allow for the laying down of the back seats.' Crook is accused of killing his parents (pictured) at their home in Swindon in July 2007 and then driving their bodies to Lincoln, where they used to live . Police said the car (similar to the one pictured) which Crook is said to have driven was not lost and was in the North of England . A spokeswoman for the CPS added: 'It's not us who lost the car. We don't investigate the case, we can't be in possession of the car.' Wiltshire Police said the car was not lost, but did not know where it was exactly. A spokesman said: 'The vehicle has not been lost, we understand it to be in the North of England. 'But I believe there was a conversation in court around whether or not it would need to be brought back for further forensics etc.' Crook appeared at the plea and case management hearing via video link from Rampton Hospital and spoke only to confirm his name and plead not guilty to the two murder charges. He is accused of murdering both parents between July 6 and 12, 2007. Some 49 witnesses are expected to be called at the trial which is provisionally set to open on July 6 and last up to four weeks.

After initially removing photos of an Alabama boy born without a nose because they were deemed to be too controversial, Facebook has reinstated photos of the infant, according to his mother. Timothy Eli Thompson was born premature on March 4 without any nasal passages or sinus cavities, a condition so rare it only has a one in 197 million chance of happening. His mother Brandi McGlathery said Facebook removed a photo of her son a pro-life group tried to post to promote Eli's story. Scroll down for video . Timothy Eli Thompson was born without a nose in March in Alabama and his mom put his photo on Facebook . A picture of Eli was removed by Facebook after a pro-life group tried to post it to promote his story . The story was shared 30,000 times in six hours and the ban was lifted after complaints, WKRG reported. Brandi said: 'I posted the status with a link about it saying no one's going to keep me from posting photos of my child. 'If I can see completely distasteful things on Facebook all day long, then I can post a picture of my son. 'He was everywhere and he broke the internet!' Eli's parents, Brandi McGlathery (left) and Troy Thompson (right) are raising money for him on GoFundMe . Eli had to undergo a tracheotomy at only five days old. Doctors hope to be able to drill nasal passages in Eli's skull which will allow him to breathe when he is older. A family friend  set up a GoFundMe page to help Eli's parents pay for his care. Brandi wrote: 'He will have to have a tracheoomy & a feeding bag inserted into his stomach, which is also not what I expected. 'I would be so grateful for anything anyone could spare, but if you cannot afford to help with money I will be just as appreciative for prayers for my sweet Eli. 'He has a long road a head of him & we need all the support we can get.' Doctors hope to be able to drill nasal passages in Eli's skull when he's older which will allow him to breathe . After he was born, Eli was treated at the USA Children's and Women's Hospital in Mobile for three weeks. McGlathery, 23, is diligently tracking the ups and downs of her baby's progress on the Eli's Journey Facebook page. She shared the good news of his test results, including an eye exam and cranial scan that came back normal, as well as the 'hard blow' the family was dealt when they found out Eli didn't have nasal passages. The mother-of-three has also shared the emotional joys she's had with Eli, including his first successful bath and bottle feeding, and the first time she saw his face without an oral respirator. She is worried about what Eli will have to experience as he grows up and wrote: 'My biggest fear for Eli is that the world won't see him as the beautiful, brave little boy that I see him as.' No matter what, the mother-of-three calls him 'the most beautiful boy I've ever laid eyes on'.
A would-be Lib Dem MP who describes himself as a feminist has been filmed repeatedly trying to touch a naked lap dancer. Married father-of-one Maajid Nawaz asked for two private sessions at a strip club in east London. Footage shows the prospective parliamentary candidate – who calls himself an advocate of women’s rights – attempting to touch her arms and thighs, which is against the venue’s policy. Scroll down for video . Up close: Would-be MP Maajid Nawaz with a scantily-clad lap dancer in the club in east London . Seedy: The married father-of-one asked for two private sessions at a strip club in east London . Staff said Nawaz had been pestering the girl all night and his actions had been ‘outrageous’. In the film, Nawaz – a convicted former extremist – can be seen repeatedly trying to make contact with the girl as she dances naked for him in a private room during two £20 lap dances. Manager Jay Shah, who witnessed Nawaz’s behaviour, said he was ‘very drunk’ and bouncers threatened to throw him out several times. ‘He was asking her to touch him and he was touching her,’ he said. ‘In general he was quite persistent with her, asking to take her out and for her number.’ A rising star of the Liberal Democrats, 37-year-old Nawaz is also a leading figure in the Muslim community and head of anti-extremism charity the Quilliam Foundation, which he set up. Rising star: The prospective parliamentary candidate with Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg . A regular guest on BBC News programmes, he declared on Newsnight in 2013: ‘I consider myself a feminist.’ He once wrote on Twitter: ‘You don’t need to be a woman to stand for women’s rights.’ He often throws his weight behind gender issues such as the campaign against female genital mutilation and paints himself as a role model for young Muslim men at risk of radicalisation. But Abdul Malik, the club’s owner, said he wanted the video to be seen by the public because of the way Nawaz portrays himself as a feminist and a family man. ‘He’s always talking about religion on TV and I thought, what a hypocrite,’ he said. He claimed ‘arrogant’ Nawaz acts like a ‘spokesman for Islam’ – but visited the club during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Staff said Nawaz had been pestering the girl all night and his actions had been ‘outrageous’ The full strip club footage, obtained by the Mail, clearly shows Nawaz receiving two five-minute lap dances an hour apart. He and two friends paid £10 entry to the small ‘gentleman’s club’ in Whitechapel and were seen drinking heavily. He left the club alone in the early hours of the morning. During the first session – in which the dancer gets naked – she has to repeatedly remove his hands from her body and pushes him away at one point. During the second dance with the same woman, he also spends time chatting to her – whispering into her ear and trying to touch her hair. Newlywed: Nawaz's second wife Rachel Maggart . She later informed the manager, who told security to ‘keep an eye on her’. Club boss Mr Shah claimed Nawaz had been ‘bragging’ but the dancer later told him: ‘Who does he think he is?’ Tory MP Nadine Dorries last night called for Nawaz to quit his candidacy. ‘In politics, you can’t advocate one cause or manner of behaviour then act differently in your personal life,’ she said. Labour MP Khalid Mahmood added: ‘The message this sends to women is not one of respect.’ British-born Nawaz was jailed in Egypt in 2005 for his role in radical Islamist group Hizb ut-Tahrir. On his return to England in 2006, he renounced his views and quickly established himself as a spokesman on extremism issues. He has been selected by party leader Nick Clegg to fight the London marginal seat of Hampstead and Kilburn and has been married to US-born writer and artist Rachel Maggart, 29, since October. They were engaged and believed to have been living together at his West London home when he visited the club on July 9 last year. He has a young son from his previous marriage to Rabia Nawaz – who is also known to have supported Hizb ut-Tahrir. A spokesman for Nawaz said he denied touching the dancer ‘inappropriately’ and added that his reputation for advocating women’s rights was ‘in the context of Islamic extremism’. He said he had not been warned about his behaviour, and was not ‘out of control’ through drink or breaching the rules. The spokesman said: ‘The evening you refer to was our client’s stag night before his marriage. ‘His best man took him to the gentleman’s club with the full knowledge of our client’s then future wife (now his wife).’ Nawaz can be seen repeatedly trying to make contact with the girl as she dances naked for him .
Alessandro Diamanti and Mohamed Salah helped Fiorentina to a 2-0 win over Sampdoria on a rain-drenched pitch which lifted their team into fourth place on 49 points. Former West Ham midfielder Diamanti struck just after the hour mark, before on loan Chelsea winger Salah added a second just two minutes later. Miralem Pjanic's goal gave AS Roma a 1-0 win over Napoli in Serie A on Saturday, their first home victory for more than four months. Mohamed Salah continued his scoring streak as the on-loan Chelsea midfielder struck again . Salah turns away after scoring Fiorentina's second in their 2-0 win over Sampdoria . Roma struck in the 25th minute when Alessandro Florenzi set up Pjanic after a string of precise passes and his low shot beat keeper Mariano Andujar. Pjanic, who was also on target when Roma last won at home against Inter Milan in November, gestured towards the press box after his goal. Elsewhere on Saturday, Carlos Tevez scored a thunderous free kick to help leaders Juventus beat Empoli 2-0 to stay 14 points clear at the top. Salah embraces fellow goalscorer and team-mates Alessandro Diamanti during the Serie A win . The Argentine's fierce free kick from inside the area two minutes before the break and a Roberto Pereyra tap-in in stoppage time gave Juve their fourth win in a row. AC Milan notched their first away win in over five months when Jeremy Menez out-ran two defenders and delivered an unstoppable shot to give his side a 2-1 victory over Palermo. Milan are eighth on 41 points, six adrift of fifth-placed Napoli.

Cesena came back from a three-goal deficit in Verona to earn a point that left them third-bottom on 22 points, four behind Atalanta who lost 2-1 at home to Torino.
Pictures of the Australian man reportedly facing the death penalty for smuggling ice in China have emerged. The man, Ibrahim Jalloh, along with another Australian, Bengali Sherrif, were reportedly arrested at Guangzhou Airport in June 2014. Sherrif has already been sentenced to death, according to the ABC. Australian man Ibrahim Jalloh is awaiting trial after reportedly being arrested attempting to smuggle drugs in China . They were allegedly in possession of a substantial quantity of ice. It is believed Sherrif’s sentence could be reduced to life in prison if it is decided he has been well-behaved during his first two years in prison. Jalloh’s trial is reportedly yet to commence. The young man arrived in Australia from Sierra Leone with his mother, three sisters and brother eight years ago. Australian citizen Bengali Sherrif has reportedly been sentenced to death after he and Queensland man Ibrahim Jalloh were arrested at Guangzhou airport (pictured) in June 2014 . Daily Mail Australia contacted the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, but it did not comment on the alleged case. 'A number of Australians are currently facing narcotics-related charges in China,' a spokeswoman said. 'All are either under investigation or awaiting trial or verdicts. For privacy reasons, we will not disclose details of individual cases.' The arrests were mentioned in a Melbourne Court last week where three men face trial, accused of being embroiled in a drug ring importing drugs to Australia from China. Queensland men Sam Komba, 20, and Foday Kamara, 29, both face one charge of conspiring to import a controlled substance, according to ABC. The two Australians were allegedly in possession of a substantial quantity of ice (stock picture) Melbourne man Wedi Bembo is charged with the same offence. He also faces an additional charge over an alleged heroin importation in 2013. Jalloh’s brother Chiwto told the court that the accused had travelled to China in the belief he was picking up passports allegedly under the orders of Sam Bembo, according to ABC. Chiwto reportedly said their mother was devastated when she received a call to say Ibrahim had instead been arrested for drug trafficking. Komba, Kamar and Bembo’s trials will be held in October.

Manchester City have decided to listen to offers for Yaya Toure and Samir Nasri this summer as the Barclays Premier League champions look to repair the damage of a disastrous title defence. City manager Manuel Pellegrini is under intense scrutiny following Sunday’s 4-2 defeat by neighbours Manchester United. But as the City board refuse to give up on their manager just yet the decision has been made to jettison high-profile players who the club believe have failed them. Manchester City have decided to listen to offers for Ivorian midfielder Yaya Toure this summer . The Premier League champions are also open to allowing Samir Nasri leave the Etihad Stadium . Toure will be made available before his value in the market dwindles. Nasri, meanwhile, has barely played since his lame showing in the Champions League at Barcelona. Defender Aleksandar Kolarov and striker Edin Dzeko are also short of admirers within the club, while midfielder James Milner is out of contract this summer. Toure may be difficult to sell as he earns in excess of £1million a month. Pellegrini is vulnerable but may be saved by a relatively undemanding fixture list up to the end of the season and by the fact that City’s No 1 choice to replace him, Pep Guardiola, is contracted to Bayern Munich for another year. However, City fear captain Vincent Kompany will miss a few weeks of the run-in with a thigh injury.
A shopper was given a shock after discovering a live mouse crawling around in a loaf of bread he bought from Aldi. Andrew Odell tweeted the company a picture of the rodent crawling around inside the packaging of his sliced white and said it was the first and last time he was going to shop at the supermarket. When Aldi replied he wrote that his heavily pregnant wife Claire had already been in touch and that the couple were 'extremely upset' about the incident. Shocking: The mouse can be seen crawling around inside the loaf of bread Mr Odell purchased from Aldi . Twitter users began responding to the original tweet, leading Mr Odell to expand on the discovery by tweeting: 'Fortunately the mouse is fine, the same cannot be said for my heavily pregnant wife'. He later complained: 'I don't think @AldiUK are taking this case seriously. I FOUND A LIVE MOUSE IN MY BREAD.' Users also shared their responses. One wrote: 'This is sickening, I hope they [Aldi] take this seriously' while another added 'that's so bad! I'm never shopping at ALDI again!'. Mr Odell's original tweet read: 'Cheers @Aldi, just used your shop in Mk for the first time....and last.' It has already been re-tweeted more than 1,600 times. Irate: Andrew Odell tweeted Aldi a series of messages after discovering the mouse inside the packaging of his loaf of bread.

A spokesman for Aldi said: 'Please be assured that the safety of our shoppers is Aldi’s number one priority. 'We have contacted the customer and will look into this as a matter of urgency.'
Real Madrid failed to activate their first option on Javier Hernandez as the deadline passed on Thursday night. The midnight deadline went by without Madrid making a formal offer to buy the Manchester United striker outright and they must now take their chances with other suitors if they wish to sign him. Hernandez, 26, has impressed in the last few weeks with five goals in his last six games including the decisive strike against Atletico Madrid in the Champions League quarter final and two goals in Madrid's 4-2 win at Celta Vigo last Sunday. Javier Hernandez is enjoying a fine run of form at Real Madrid - scoring three times in his last two games . Hernandez (centre) returned to training with his Real Madrid team-mates on Tuesday . Hernandez (second left) was all smiles in training, but the 26-year-old faces an uncertain future . Yet it has followed a largely frustrating season where he has been restricted to just nine starts. United agreed a deal worth around £15million last summer which allowed Real Madrid to first loan Hernandez for the season then buy him outright before other clubs could bid. That exclusivity period passed at midnight though and that will open the door for other clubs to bid. The Mexico international has interest from West Ham, Southampton, Newcastle and Lazio among others and United value him at around £10million.
Manchester City are coming up against statistically the deadliest striker in the Premier League when they face Crystal Palace on Easter Monday. Glenn Murray has scored a goal on average every 91 minutes this season - giving him a better minutes-per-goal ratio than anyone else in the top flight. Harry Kane and Diego Costa are locked on 19 goals in the race to finish as this season's top scorer but rank fourth and fifth respectively, behind Papiss Cisse and Olivier Giroud. Glenn Murray celebrates scoring from the penalty spot against Stoke City last time out . Harry Kane has scored 19 goals for Tottenham in what has been a breakthrough season for him . Chelsea striker Diego Costa has enjoyed a prolific first season in England after signing from Atletico Madrid . Olivier Giroud has had a fine season despite missing a large chunk of it through injury . In-form Arsenal striker Giroud and Newcastle hitman Cisse have had their seasons interrupted by injury and suspension, while Murray was out on loan at Reading until January. Taking into account only players who have played more than 300 minutes of football, Chelsea have four players in the top 10, including Andre Schurrle, who left for Wolfsburg in January. Costa is expected to miss two weeks of action with a hamstring injury but the minutes-per-goal ratios of Loic Remy and Didier Drogba suggest he won't be too sorely missed - they rank eighth and ninth respectively. Intriguingly, ex-Chelsea veteran Frank Lampard has a marginally better ratio than his Manchester City team-mate Sergio Aguero and ranks sixth on the list. But Murray, who has scored four goals for Palace in 364 minutes this season, betters them all. Murray slides in to score for Crystal Palace against Arsenal at Selhurst Park back in February . The experienced frontman celebrates scoring one of two goals he netted against West Ham in February .
Utrecht has twelve players on the pitch at one stage during Sunday's 1-1 draw with Ajax at the Stadion Galgenwaard. No, the home side weren't cheating but instead Utrecht winger Edouard Duplan had no idea he had been substituted midway through the first-half. The referee blew on 24 minutes amid confusion Utrecht had an extra man on the pitch and marched over to Duplan. Edouard Duplan is spoken to by the referee as Utrecht appear to have twelve players on the pitch against Ajax . The referee points at substitute Tommy Oar on the field of the play and Duplan appears to realise his mistake . Duplan makes his way off the pitch and hops over the advertising hoarding to the Utrecht bench on Sunday . Duplan sees the funny side of mishap and laughs with the bench during Utrecht's 1-1 draw with Ajax . The Frenchman protested but suddenly seemed to realise substitute Tommy Oar was now on the pitch and soon made his departure. With a hop over the advertising hoardings, Duplan saw the funny side and attempted to explain the mix-up to his team-mates on the bench. Having briefly had twelve players on the pitch during the first half, Utrecht ended the game with 10, following Ramon Leeuwin's sending off in the 87th minute. Leeuwin didn't have the best of afternoon's after putting the ball into his own net to give Ajax the lead before Gevero Markiet equalised for Utrecht with five minutes to go. Australia international Tommy Oar replaced  team-mate Duplan in the 24th minute of the Eredivisie clash .
Andy Flower, England team director who guided sides to three Ashes triumphs and the world No 1 spot, will not be interfering in any way with the work of the next director of England cricket. The England Cricket Board gave Flower the confusing title of technical director of elite coaching after he renegotiated a new role at significantly lower pay after resigning as team boss following the last Ashes whitewash. This has led to speculation that Flower’s continuing role on the ECB staff would conflict with the job description of the new appointment. Former England team director Andy Flower is now technical director of elite coaching at the ECB . But effectively Flower is now running the England cricket academy at Loughborough and working with young players in a coaching role, and liaising with counties. And it’s understood he has no wish to get involved at England senior level again or become entangled in the politics. Those politics have Kevin Pietersen at centre stage as ever. But Flower, having closed one chapter in his life and fully moved on to his behind-the-scenes Loughborough role, is highly unlikely to speak out about KP now. Meanwhile, Pietersen, who is using social media app Periscope to film himself getting a sun tan or whistling, continues to dominate the PR battle against the ECB, who botched his axing and have totally mismanaged the fall-out since. Kevin Pietersen is back playing cricket for Surrey in the hope of winning back a Test spot in the England side . It looks only a matter of time before Manuel Pellegrini is sacked as Manchester City manager. And his son Juan, who is living in England, isn’t waiting for the axe to fall on his father, having already made plans to take his wife and four children back to Chile. However, Juan’s return is purely for family reasons with his wife, who has just had twins, wanting family support to look after four kids who are under the age of five. Only the ECB’s hopeless media team could launch the domestic NatWest T20 Blast, which needs all the promotional hype it can muster to compete with the IPL and Big Bash, on the same day as an England Test match. And only the ECB, having brought in former Ashes hero Freddie Flintoff to drum up publicity for the launch, could then decide he shouldn’t speak to national newspapers. An ECB spokesman said the date wasn’t ideal but they were constrained by the domestic and international schedule. And the print media snub was due to the ECB having limited time with Flintoff. Andrew Flintoff (left) shares a joke with Warwickshire and England's Chris Woakes at the T20 Blast launch . There was a player for all 18 counties present at the T20 Blast launch on Thursday . It can cause problems in football when agents represent players and managers. But the ECB have no concerns that former county cricketer Luke Sutton represents both Jimmy Anderson and England head coach Peter Moores. Likewise, the FA say they have no problems with England manager Roy Hodgson’s agent being Leon Angel who also looks after emerging international Danny Rose. Coincidentally, West Indies coach Phil Simmons is paid well enough to need the advice of David Manasseh, whose Stellar agency clients include the world’s most expensive footballer Gareth Bale. Sepp’s no messiah . Sepp Blatter’s smooth procession to a ridiculous fifth term as FIFA president continued at the Central American CONCACAF Congress in the Bahamas. Such was the lack of democracy Blatter’s three rivals weren’t even given the opportunity to address delegates. One delegate, Osiris Guzman of the Dominican Republic, was so sycophantic towards Blatter he spoke of him in the same terms as Moses, Jesus Christ and Nelson Mandela. God help us. Andrew Strauss is part of Sky’s top-heavy team of cricket pundits for the Ashes series. But that commitment should not prove an obstacle to him becoming director of England Cricket, a position for which he is one of the front-runners. Strauss is one of the weak links in the commentary box - Sir Ian Botham is the other - and looks far more suited to be a Hugh Morris-style leader of England cricket if that’s what the ECB decide they’re looking for. Former England captain Andrew Strauss is a front-runner to becoming director of England Cricket . Such is the friendship between Hampshire chairman Rod Bransgrove and Sir Ian Botham, who are each building houses on St Kitts, that the new restaurant in the Hilton Hotel that is part of the Ageas Bowl outside Southampton is to be called Beefy’s despite Botham having no association with Hampshire.
Technology: A study found that the majority of older workers did not believe better computer skills would help them in their current job . A generation of older workers are risking redundancy and long-term unemployment because of poor technology skills, it is claimed. Experts said training was ‘heavily geared’ towards young people, meaning many older workers were left behind in the workplace. This left them vulnerable when companies start ‘shedding’ jobs. While older generations often pride themselves on their numeracy and literacy skills, even these could ‘go stale’ with age, a study warned. The Association of Accounting Technicians (AAT) said research showed that over-55s had the same literacy and numeracy skills as those aged 16 to 24 – and were worse at these skills than colleagues in their 30s and 40s. The AAT said the death of a ‘job for life’ meant workers could no longer rely on loyalty to their company and experience to take them through to retirement with the same employer. Instead, older workers could not become complacent and must constantly ‘reskill’ and retrain to boost their job security, it said. In a new report on the value of training for older workers, it said: ‘The old model of training in youth and a "career for life" thereafter no longer applies’. A survey by the AAT found that, while people in their twenties, thirties and forties aspired to take a master’s degree in the future or a vocational qualification, this stopped at 55, when most respondents said they were unlikely to undertake a formal qualification. A third of over-55s cited their age as the reason for not wanting to take a new qualification. The majority of older workers did not believe better computer skills would help them in their current job, while an astonishing one in 10 have never used a computer. But the AAT said the reality was they may have a ‘lack of knowledge of what modern and technological tools there are available which could assist them carrying out their tasks’. Education: A third of over-55s cited their age as the reason for not wanting to take a new qualification . Mark Farrar, of the AAT, said: ‘Older generations are faced with the greatest barriers when it comes to reskilling. ‘Given rapid economic and technological changes, many traditional jobs are less secure than in the past and older workers are increasingly facing the threat of redundancy. ‘The UK’s ageing population is growing and the increased retirement age means people are working for longer. ‘The challenge is therefore to ensure people can continue to participate in the labour market at the later stage of their working lives.’ According to the Office for National Statistics, workers aged 55 and over are less likely to be unemployed than younger workers. But older unemployed people are more likely to have been out of work for 12 months or longer, suggesting they find it harder to find a new job if they do find themselves out of work. The accountancy body said older men were particularly vulnerable to job losses in the declining mining, agriculture and manufacturing industries, while women were heavily over-represented in the public sector so could face risks from cuts to civil servants.
President Barack Obama made an unscheduled stop to the Bob Marley museum in Jamaica last night while on a visit to the country for a meeting with Caribbean leaders. The first president to visit Jamaica in three decades, Obama arrived in Kingston yesterday evening and was met by Prime Minister Portia Simpson-Miller, U.S. Ambassador to Jamaica Luis Moreno and a dozen other dignitaries. Obama promptly embraced the local color  by making an unscheduled late night visit to the museum dedicated to the island's most famous son. Scroll down for video . Barack Obama made an unscheduled stop at the Bob Marley museum while on an official visit to Jamaica . The U.S. President walks around the museum with tour guide Natasha Clark during his unannounced visit . On a tour of the house where the reggae legend lived until his death in 1981, Obama, looking relaxed in shirtsleeves, was shown a trophy room where Marley's Grammys and platinum records were on display. At the same time Marley's hit song 'One Love' played over the loudspeaker. The musician's family transformed the rambling property into a museum complete with a well-equipped 80-seat theatre, a photographic gallery, and a gift shop selling T-shirts, posters and CDs and other Bob Marley memorabilia. One of the rooms Obama explored held the late reggae star's platinum records and a Grammy award. Thee president looks at selection of Bob Marley's gold records at the Bob Marley Museum in Kingston . The building was home to Marley until his death in 1981 and was converted into a museum by his family . 'What a wonderful tour,' the president told museum guide Natasha Clark. 'I still have all the albums.' Obama is in Jamaica to meet the 15-member Caribbean Community bloc. The visit is part of an official Caribbean summit seeking to reassert U.S. leadership in the region at a time when oil-producing Venezuela's economic clout may be receding. The Caribbean region collectively cheered when Obama was first elected president in 2008. Calypso and reggae songs were written in his honor, the French Caribbean island of Martinique named a road after him, and Antigua's highest mountain officially became 'Mount Obama' as the small country saluted him as a symbol of black achievement. Obama thanked the guide for a wonderful tour and told her he still owns all of Bob Marley's albums . Obama is in Jamaica to meet the 15-member Caribbean Community bloc to discuss energy and security . As the first U.S. president to visit Kingston since Ronald Reagan in 1982, Obama faces the challenge of convincing Caribbean island leaders that Washington is genuinely re-engaging after a long period of perceived neglect of its smaller, poorer neighbors. The visit is expected to be dominated by discussions on energy, security and trade with the 15-member Caribbean Community, or Caricom. Some analysts say a key reason why Washington is suddenly paying attention to the Caribbean Basin is that it wants to wean the islands off dependence on cut-rate Venezuelan oil that Caracas has long used to wield influence in the region. From Jamaica, Obama will travel to Panama to attend a Western Hemisphere summit, where Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has made clear he will confront Obama over new U.S. sanctions. Obama will also cross paths at the Summit of the Americas with Cuban President Raul Castro for the first time since the two announced a historic opening between their countries in December.
She's the clean eating food lover who has more than 102,000 followers on Instagram thanks to her healthy and delicious looking meals. But she has a secret weapon that most food bloggers don't have - when people aren't obsessing over her recipes, they're checking out her rock-hard abs. We're talking about Clean Eating Alice, the latest social media sensation to be making a name for herself by living a healthy life. Scroll down for video . Over the last year Alice (pictured before, left, and after, right) has completely transformed her body with the help of healthy eating and the LDN Muscle bikini guide . Alice Liveing, from Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire, began her healthy journey just over a year ago. She said: 'After years of bad skin, constant fatigue and feeling uncomfortable about my appearance I decided to completely overhaul my approach to eating. 'I started experimenting with food, and found that simply changing what I ate for breakfast had a huge impact on my mood and energy for that day. 'The term [clean eating] is completely subjective and can mean different things to different people, but my interpretation of it was to develop a healthy relationship with food. 'I didn’t restrict myself or feel like I was dieting as such, and learnt how best to fuel my body with tasty and nutritious food.' In these Instagram snaps Alice shows off toned arms, something she said she had previously struggled with . Alice started sharing pictures of her meals on Instagram, which allowed her to take stock of what she was putting into her body. 'I remember a distinct turning point was when I began to post photos of my food on the social media platform Instagram,' she said. 'The idea that I would be making healthy food, and being able to log and share it on Instagram was nothing novel or new, but was helpful for me to keep track of what I was eating. 'I also found great pleasure in making my food look nice, as well as taste good. 'I am conscious that some people may find it annoying when their friends start posting foodie pics on social media, but however annoying they may find it, it is precisely what enabled me to find a healthy relationship with food and create new and delicious dishes that could then help others.' In this snap Alice shows off her figure in a pair of shorts ready for a New Year's Eve party . Of course you don't get a body like Alice's without putting in a lot of hard work. She revealed: 'I aim to go to the gym between four and six times a week, and follow the LDN Muscle Bikini Guide. 'I think one of the best things about this journey is that I found a way of exercising that I loved which I think is so important, and I have LDN Muscle to thank for that. 'I think that the way I look has gained me a few male admirers, but I try to avoid letting any of this attention go to my head!' On the LDN Muscle website, the weight training programme says it aims to promote a 'natural, lean and aesthetic physique'. But when it comes to health and fitness tips there is often only one question on her fans lips. She said: 'My most frequently asked questions are usually about how to poach an egg, which is always funny, and I guess I have my own technique that I am always happy to share.' Alice - who also uses the Healthy Selfie App to chart her progress - poses in the mirror showing off her extremely defined abs . Alice trains in the gym up to six times a week which is how she maintains her impressive body . She continued: 'Other questions usually focus on what exercise I do, and most notably what abdominal exercises I do. 'I try and answer all questions as I like to help people as best I can.' Alice says that it's been amazing to see her social media following grow and that in the future she would love to be the female Jamie Oliver. She said: 'I would love to bring healthy eating to the masses and be the female equivalent of Jamie Oliver. 'My food isn’t complicated, expensive or pretentious nor does it require ingredients that you can’t find in your local supermarket. 'I will be bringing out some recipe ebooks in partnership with LDN Muscle which will include breakfast, lunch and dinner ideas, as well as launching my YouTube channel and personal training. 'On top of all of this I am just about to graduate from Bird College where I have trained for three years as a musical theatre performer, and I am hoping to also pursue my dream to perform in the West End.' Alice says that what she eats changes every day: 'My recipes are usually created from what I fancy eating on a given day, and what I’ve got in the fridge. 'I usually take out all the ingredients I fancy and then try and think how I can create something tasty with them. 'My meals are always built around a protein source, so I usually start there, for example a chicken breast, or salmon and then try and pack in some veg, such as kale, spinach or broccoli, and then add a carb source, my favourite being sweet potato. 'I always try and experiment with seasoning too, so things like paprika, and turmeric to add some flavour.' She continued: 'In terms of avoiding foods, I stay away from refined sugars, and most processed foods, although I am a big bacon lover. 'Alcohol is something that I just make conscious decisions on now, so for example if I’m going to have a drink I’ll have a vodka and diet coke, rather than a brightly coloured alcho-pop. 'It’s all about not feeling restricted and instead just making better choices, and ultimately enjoying being fit and healthy.' Alice says that she likes to start her mornings with a breakfast such as this breakfast wrap made with egg white and crispy chorizo . Breakfast: . Healthy breakfast 'wrap' with spicy paprika egg white wrap, stuffed with crispy chorizo, avocado, rocket, red onion and tomatoes. For lunch Alice might enjoy a cauliflower rice, chicken sausages, toasted almonds, rocket and tomato salad . Lunch: .

One New York-based teacher has found an incredibly fashionable and glamorous way to supplement his public school income, working as a model for some of the world’s top designers. Sam Pearce, 24, of Milton, Massachusetts, initially came to New York City to peruse a career in education, and soon after arriving in the Big Apple he landed a job teaching English to eighth graders in Brooklyn, New York. But just a few months after landing the job, the six-foot, green-eyed Brown University graduate was 'discovered' on the subway by another model, who promptly asked whether he could send Mr. Pearce’s picture to his own modeling agency in the hopes of getting him signed up. Model behavior: New York teacher Sam Pearce, 24, was discovered on the F train in New York City and now juggles his career as an eighth-grade English teacher with a side job modelling for top designers . 'I was taken aback and flattered, but also kind of incredulous,' he told Racked of the encounter, which took place on the F train. 'He was just like, "Hey, you're a model, right?" I said, "Noooo, I'm a teacher, dude."' Soon after, Mr. Pearce, who was at the time teaching a summer school course and standing to earn $45,530 in the coming school year, signed a modelling contract with RED NYC and started posing for designer lookbooks and walking in fashion shows in London and Milan under the name Sam Worthen, a pseudonym taken from his mother's maiden name. But the hunky instructor insists that he doesn't let his side job posing for Alexander McQueen, Diesel Black Gold, and DKNY interfere with his responsibility to his students. Classroom to catwalk: Mr. Pearce says his two jobs are similar in that they are both hectic and he needs to keep a straight face during each of them . Renaissance man: Besides teaching and modelling, Mr. Pearce also speaks French, Spanish, and Italian and composes his own music . 'My agents have been pretty great about understanding that teaching is my priority, and they've gotten me jobs that require me to miss little or no school,' he said. 'I did the Alexander McQueen show — that was my first real show — over a weekend. I flew out to London on Saturday evening, did the show, and then flew home immediately after; so I was in London for 12 hours.' He also managed to fit walking in New York Fashion Week this February into his teaching schedule, modelling in shows during New York City public schools' week-long winter break. In fact, Mr. Pearce managed to maintain the secret of his second identity until very recently, and even then, he admits he only revealed himself because he thought the publicity could benefit his kids. Male model: Mr. Pearce knows there's more to life than being really, really, ridiculously good looking; he also places a lot of importance on getting his English students to read . 'I thought if people take interest in my story I could convert that interest into resources for my students,' he told Fox CT. Mr. Pearce launched a Go-Fund-Me campaign called The Right Book to raise funds to buy all 67 of his students new books, and the attention his plea received helped him quickly surpass his goal of $3,000 in donations. He is now urging would-be donors to help more teachers and students through fundraising website DonorsChoose.org. 'I definitely think of myself as a teacher who happens to model, rather than a model who happens to teach,' he told People, adding that it is clear to him that models are replaceable but teachers are not.
The richest fight of all time continues to break through the barriers of history – mostly in terms of financial records, naturally. For the first time in the annals of boxing – as Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao step on the scales next Friday – fans will be charged for admission to a weigh-in. This formality for checking that combatants weigh no more than the stipulated poundage for each division started to become an event in its own right in 2007 when Ricky Hatton went to Las Vegas to take his Man Of La Mancha tilt at the Mayweather windmill. Floyd Mayweather with girlfriend Doralie Medina (left) and Manny Pacquiao with his wife Jinkee (right) Pacquiao with his wife and  children (left to right) Michael, Israel, Emmanuel, Princess and Queen Elizabeth . Mayweather visits SubZero Recovery in Las Vegas, a new-age version of the ice bath . No fewer than 30,000 of the Manchester Hitman's army followed him across the Atlantic and thousands of them turned up for the weigh-in. The atmosphere was electrified when Hatton yelled 'let's be having him' as Mayweather was about to follow him onto the stage. Hatton would be knocked out but there was more of the same when he went back to the MGM Grand to suffer the same fate against Pacquiao two years later. Since then weigh-ins there have turned into sound and light spectacles, taking place inside the Grand Garden Arena itself, and the audiences keep growing. The decision to sell tickets for this one has been made in the interests of safety, not profit. Up to 200,000 visitors are expected to pour into Vegas this fight week and the MGM need to control the crowds at all the associated events. Thousands of fans watched Ricky Hatton and Mayweather weigh-in at the MGM Grand Garden Arena . Hatton points towards the crowd during his heated weigh-in with Mayweather in December 2007 . Mayweather poses in his TMT clothing as he takes a break from training over the weekend . To avoid accusations of cashing in on the phenomenon the hotel and both promoters – Mayweather and Top Rank – will donate all revenue from the weigh-in to charities nominated by the Money Man and the PacMan. Mayweather and Pacquiao will be required to weigh not more than 10st 7lbs. The winner will unify the WBC (Mayweather) and WBO (Pacquiao) world welterweight titles. Wladimir Klitschko, as he makes a rare appearance in the US this Saturday, admits that at 39 he has to start considering when he might hang up those huge gloves. However, assuming he adds Bryant Jennings to his long list of victims, that will not happen before Dr Iron Fist has obliged the two young pretenders to his heavyweight throne. Namely our own Tyson Fury and America's KO sensation Deontay Wilder. Wladimir Klitschko has admitted that he is considering retirement as he approaches his 40th birthday . Klitschko says: 'I do have to start thinking about retirement.' But then the Ukrainian who boxes mostly to sell-out crowds in German football stadia, adds: 'I would like to fight Fury, which would be a huge event in Europe. 'I want to fight Wilder, to add the only remaining belt to my unified world titles.' Unusually, both men would present Klitschko with opposition as tall or, in Fury's case, even taller than his own 6ft 6in. Fury is his mandatory challenger for the WBO title. Wilder holds the WBC title which was vacated by Klitschko's brother Vitali when he retired to concentrate on the violent complexities of Ukrainian politics as Mayor of Kiev. WBC heavyweight champions Deontay Wilder looks set to face Klitschko before he hangs up his gloves . Wladimir is also the WBA, IBF, IBO and Ring magazine champion. There is another factor which will tempt him to prolong his reign even further. Currently he ranks fourth in the all-time list of successive world heavyweight title defences, with 18. Victories over Jennings – which looks to be something of a formality in New York's Madison Square Garden, would lift him level with Muhammad Ali and Larry Holmes on 19. If he adds wins over Fury and Wilder he will close to within just four victories of the 25-defences record held by Joe Louis. That is likely to be an opportunity too good to refuse. Tyson Fury, pictured in action against Dereck Chisora, is Klitschko's mandatory challenger for the WBO title . The crushing defeat of Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr by the largely unheralded and, in terms of his first name, unpronounceable Pole Andrzej Fonfara, complicates Carl Froch's exit strategy from the ring. One of Froch's two dream scenarios has been a farewell fight in Las Vegas, probably against Chavez with his box office appeal for America's Hispanic population and fans south of the border in Mexico. But the namesake son of an idolised father was so badly beaten up through nine rounds in California by Fonfara – suffering the first knock down of his career in the process – that he quit on his stool. Carl Froch could choose to retire after Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr's defeat by Andrzej Fonfara last week . Inadvisedly, Chavez had agreed to a catch-weight fight with light-heavyweight contender Fonfara and is talking about going back down to Froch's super-middleweight division. Whether this former middleweight champion would still be a draw after this setback is doubtful and Froch had said before the fight that it would hurt his plans 'if Chavez got knocked out. The other swansong ambition – to fight on the City Ground of his beloved Nottingham Forest – suffered a setback when Andre Ward agreed to come to England for their mandatory WBA title unifier but not to Froch's home town. Retirement is becoming an increasingly attractive option for the Cobra. Chavez (right) was stopped after nine rounds on his return to the ring following more than a year out .
It is a leap of faith that could easily have ended in disaster. But thankfully, stunt performer Antti Pendikainen had attached a parachute to his snowmobile to safely deposit him on the ground after driving his vehicle off a mountain. Captured on camera, these amazing images show the moment the Finnish driver took to the skies. Finnish stunt performer, Antti Pendikainen soars through the air with a parachute attached to his snowmobile in Riksgrnsen, Sweden . Captured on camera, this adrenalin fuelled footage shows the moment a daredevil driver took to the skies after racing his snowmobile off the edge of a mountain . The group managed to strap materials together to make an incredible but rickety flying machine . Instead of plummeting 1500 metres to his death, Pendikainen, defied gravity by floating effortlessly above the snowy peaks of Riksgränsen in Sweden thanks to a parachute attached to the vehicle. But what might sound like a nightmare, white-knuckle ride for most people was a walk in the park for Antti who is seen casually spinning on his seat mid-flight and even waving at a trailing helicopter. The brain child of Finnish extreme sports group, Stunt Freak Team, the barmy bunch spent just three hours conjuring up the plan before beginning test flights. By using wood from an old truck bed, a tandem parachute and of course, duct tape, the group managed to strap the materials together to make an incredible but rickety flying machine.

'This is the first time we have tried anything like this, it was the stuff of TV as the first sled was ready for test drive in just three hours. 'We built the flying machine using an old truck bed, wood from the loading platform, a tandem parachute and duct tape. 'Antti left the side of the mountain at full throttle, his heart rate was little over 195bpm during the flight and even faster when he drove off the cliff. 'It is actually possible to drive the snow mobile whilst in air, you can control the drive by pulling the ropes on either side of the parachute. 'When you are in the air it feels like you are riding a snowmobile without gravity, it's very relaxing and very exciting.' In its infancy, the project was originally looking at ways to perform a snowmobile base jump .

Jurgen Klopp rejected the overtures of West Ham United after handing in his notice at Borussia Dortmund. No matter, it was worth a try. Now on to the next one. If Rafael Benitez wants to return to English football after leaving Napoli maybe he can be persuaded to take over a project that includes a move to the iconic Olympic Stadium in a year's time. West Ham need a coach of high ambition to underline the size of the venture. Sam Allardyce isn't that man. He had his chance and did not take it. Allardyce has often talked of the qualities he could bring to an elite club, but the momentum of his season changed on Boxing Day when he left his best players out of the starting line-up at Chelsea, and lost. Sam Allardyce is not the man to lead West Ham into their new exciting adventure at the Olympic Stadium . Allardyce (left, pictured behind Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini) has not been up to scratch . Click here to read chief sports writer Martin Samuel's brilliant column on Jack Grealish . The folly of resting key individuals for such an important game over the Christmas period was exposed as West Ham then played two home fixtures, losing to Arsenal and drawing with West Brom. If West Ham had maintained their form going into the Chelsea game — 31 points from 17 matches — they would now be fifth in the league. Had their form since that day been played out through the season — 12 points from 16 games — they would be bottom. Allardyce's reputation is that of a man who guarantees survival, but since Christmas West Ham have been playing relegation football. If a new manager is being considered, it is understandable. West Ham must go to the Olympic Stadium with more on their minds than survival. Rafael Benitez could return to English football after Napoli and may be persuaded by the Hammers project .
A $1.5 million dollar house has been sold for $125,000, after it was put on the market for just one dollar. A kiwi couple has snapped up a bargain by buying property for more than $1.25 million less than it is worth. The four-bedroom home near Auckland attracted plenty of interest after its sellers put it on the market at such a low price. The $1.5 million house a New Zealand couple bought for just $125,000 . Real estate agent Tony Keegan said the Melbourne-based former owners were desperate to sell the property, which resulted in the million-dollar bargain. New owners Donald and Jenny Gibbs said the deal was too good to pass up, according to the New Zealand Herald. 'Happy wife, happy life,' said Mr Gibbs, a Ray White apartment agent, as he signed the sale and purchase agreement. The house was listed by its former owners with just a $1 reserve, despite its million-dollar price-tag. 'I bought it for the fireplace,' said Mrs Gibbs, who also said her two sons aged 18 and 21 would be able to live in the home. Before the auction, Mr Keegan questioned whether the owners would get the $95,000 they had paid in October 2010. But I think it will sell for rather more than $1 although that was its advertised reserve,' Mr Keegan said.

To hear Leigh Griffiths tell it, the intervention staged by Celtic boss Ronny Deila and assistant John Collins was definitely closer to a kick in the what-nots than it was a pat on the back. Whatever the detail of the conversation, and however lasting the effects may be, the short-term impact on the 24-year-old force of nature — often as unruly and unpredictable as a whirlwind — has been nothing short of remarkable. As the kid himself puts it: ‘Being top scorer now means that, since I have had a talk with the manager, I have knuckled down and proved him wrong, proved JC wrong and shown that I deserve to be here.’ Hat-trick hero Leigh Griffiths with signed match ball and man of the match award . Rather revealing, isn’t it? Clearly demanding Deila and original gym rat Collins did not hold back in dealing with the gifted but wild natural talent, wielding a big stick in a bid to persuade Griffiths that the carrot wasn’t such a bad alternative to chips and tea cakes. ‘I had to improve,’ admits the former Hibs star. ‘I wasn’t playing at the start of the season. I had a talk with the manager and John Collins about everything and about what they wanted me to do. ‘Thankfully, in the two months since the turn of the year, I have knuckled down and they are seeing the rewards now. ‘What did they say to me? I had to be working hard in the gym and working hard to get my fitness levels up. I did that and I have been bang on form since the turn of the year. ‘When I was at Hibs, I would have been the first name on the team sheet given the goals I scored. ‘But coming here, it’s a massive club and, with the new manager coming into the club, he wanted to impose his own philosophy. ‘Playing one up front, you have to work hard and my fitness levels were not up to his standards. Since January, though, my fitness levels have been good and I have been scoring goals. ‘I was brought to Celtic to score goals and I’ve started to do that since the turn of the year. I haven’t set any new targets — but I do want a good run of games. ‘I want to be starting every game from now until the end of the season and score as many goals as I possibly can. Celtic's Leigh Griffiths (right) completes his hat-trick against Kilmarnock . ‘The manager selects the team he thinks is best to win the game and we have boys in the squad and coming on from the bench. ‘Myself, Anthony Stokes, Stuart Armstrong, Gary Mackay-Steven were all on the bench against Kilmarnock.’ Griffiths is making a stronger case than most by banging in the goals, his hat-trick in Wednesday night’s 4-1 home win over Kilmarnock definitely ranking among the better substitute performances the Scottish game has seen this season. His second treble haul in Celtic colours took his total for the season to 15 goals, the majority of those coming in 2015, as he has contended more frequently with John Guidetti, Stefan Scepovic and Anthony Stokes for the lone striker’s role favoured — for now, at least — by Deila. Watching Guidetti amble around aimlessly until Griffiths arrived to partner the big Swede on Wednesday night, it definitely seems as though Deila has only two options for Sunday’s Scottish Cup semi-final against Inverness. Either he plays both in a traditional front-pairing. Or he lets Griffiths, scorer of an early opener against Caley Thistle in the Highlands last weekend, loose on his own at Hampden. If his midweek goals explosion makes it impossible to omit the former Livingston, Dundee and Wolves striker from the starting XI, his record in major semi-finals at the national stadium also counts in his favour. Substitute Griffiths came off the bench to spark Celtic into life after lacklustre first-half . The extra-time hero as he scored his second of the game to ease Hibs past Falkirk 4-3 at this stage of the Scottish Cup two years ago, Griffiths also opened the scoring for Celtic against Rangers in the League Cup semi earlier this season. ‘I’ve played in two semi-finals at Hampden and I have won two,’ he points out. ‘Hopefully, I can continue that. ‘I’ll be looking to score again. But the most important thing is for the team to win the game and reach the Scottish Cup Final. ‘Inverness will come down and make it difficult for us. They proved last weekend they are a hard team to beat. ‘Every game against them this season has been tight and I expect the same again on Sunday.’ If Griffiths starts and plays as he did against Killie, even Caley Thistle at their most obdurate will struggle to cope. His hat-trick — one perfectly placed header, one absolute screamer from distance and a driven low finish — was a timely reminder of what he can do, when the mood is upon him. Celtic manager Ronny Deila (left) congratulates Griffiths after the final whistle . ‘It wasn’t a bad night’s work,’ he says with a smile. ‘It was just good to get the win because we were disappointed not to win at Inverness last weekend. And we had suffered a setback, going 1-0 down to Kilmarnock, although the boys fought back in the right way. ‘All of the goals were my favourites. The first one was a great ball into the box by Kris Commons and I managed to head it down into the net. ‘The second one went in off the post and I was just waiting for the whistle to go for being offside for the third. Thankfully, it didn’t come and I fired it back across the goalkeeper. ‘It’s only my third hat-trick in senior football, so it’s decent. My second one came for Celtic against Inverness last year.’ Cute move, dropping that into conversation. Take note, gaffer? Not only am I bang in form, not only do I have a great record at Hampden, but I’ve shown I can do the business against Inverness. Celtic start as favourites on Sunday and, with Hibs also edging the odds in their semi against Falkirk, Griffiths could spend May 30 torn between professional pride and genuine love for his hometown team. Asked outright if he would like to face Hibernian, balancing up the desire to become a Treble winner against the need to condemn his boyhood heroes to at least one more year of Scottish Cup taunts, Griffiths admitted: ‘Honest answer, no! ‘If they get there, it will be great for the club, but I’m just concentrating on doing my job for Celtic. We are eight points clear in the league and in a good position and, obviously, we want to go for the Treble. ‘There is still a long way to go and we have difficult games coming up. At the moment, Inverness are standing in our way of having a potentially great season.’
A British marathon runner has become the first blind athlete to complete the 'toughest footrace on Earth', which saw him run almost 160 miles across the Sahara Desert. Dave Heeley, 57, from West Bromwich, ran the gruelling challenge over six days as he battled through sand dunes, dried river beds and rocks. The super-fit father-of-three, known affectionately by his friends as 'Blind Dave', took part in the Marathon des Sables where competitors carry provisions on their backs and temperatures can rise to 50 degrees. Scroll down for video . Dig in: Dave Heeley, pictured with his guide, is the first blind man to finish the Marathon des Sables . Endurance: In the marathon, brave competitors run 156 miles in six days across the Sahara Desert . Thumbs up: Father-of-three Mr Heeley has raised funds for the Albion Foundation, a charity that works in partnership with his beloved West Brom to use sport as a way to help the local community . Mr Heeley - who became the first blind man to run seven marathons on seven continents in 2008 - set off on April 5 and hopes to raise more than £30,000 for charity. He was joined by two guides and friends Rosemary Rhodes and Tony Ellis. The 57-year-old crossed the finish line on Friday after running 156 miles and camping in the desert. Tough: In the Marathon des Sables, athletes have to carry their provisions on their back and sleep in tents . Rocky: Mr Heeley struggled with the terrain as he hadn't done any mountain climbing, but still finished the race . Completed: Mr Heeley finished the 'toughest foot race on Earth' on Friday after running almost 160 miles . The Marathon des Sables translates into English as Marathon of the Sands. It was started in 1986 by Patrick Bauer - a French concert promoter. The course is about 156 miles, the equivalent of six regular marathons. It is a six day race and there is only one rest day. Competitors must carry all their provisions for the whole race on their back. Temperatures in the desert can reach 50 degrees during the day and more than 40 per cent humidity, while dropping to below freezing at night time . Other famous Britons to compete include rower James Cracknell. His wife, Debbie, 48, said: 'The terrain was something that he did not know how to manage. 'The team hadn't done any mountain climbing in their training. 'It took them a bit longer than he expected as a result. They were eight or nine hour days running in that heat. 'It was sweltering and he also had to go through sandstorms. The conditions were difficult.' She added: 'They had to do 56.5 miles straight and run through the night at one stage. 'They had to go up a big hill at that part and going down can be just as bad, especially if you can't see. 'I am very proud. It is certainly a tough challenge. 'He has done a number of difficult challenges in the past but this tops it. I am very pleased for him.' Mr Heeley has been raising money for the Albion Foundation, a charity that works in partnership with his beloved West Bromwich Albion FC to use sport as a way to benefit the community. So far, he has raised £20,000 but hopes to reach a further £10,000. Resting up: Mr Heeley ran through the Sahara Desert and then had to sleep in his tent and make his own food . In 2008, the father-of-three completed the Seven Magnificent Marathons challenge which saw him finish seven marathons in a week on seven continents. His route took him from Port Stanley, Falkland Islands (Antarctica), to Santiago, Chile (South America), Los Angeles, USA (North America), Sydney, Australia (Australasia), Dubai, United Arab Emirates (Asia), Nairobi, Kenya (Africa), before finishing with the London Marathon. In another record breaking achievement, explorer Sir Ranulph Fiennes became the oldest Briton to finish the Marathon des Sables when he completed this year's course at the age of 71.
Supporters of ISIS have 'declared a caliphate' in Yemen through a bizarre video showing a group of masked fighters a barren desert. The video, allegedly shot near the capital of Sanaa, sees some 20 men wearing desert camouflage uniforms carry out a carefully choreographed rifle routine in the sand. The 'establishing' of an ISIS-related group in Yemen comes after months of conflict which has seen Iran-backed Houthi rebels fight both the government and the local Al Qaeda affiliates. Scroll down for video . Declaration of fear: The video shows a group of ISIS supporters, calling itself Soldiers of the Caliphate in Yemen, announcing that they have established a 'caliphate' in the country . The group in the video, which calls itself Soldiers of the Caliphate in Yemen, began to emerge late last year and it is believed that their aim is to take over Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), which has strongholds in the south and south-east of Yemen. Last month, the ISIS-related group claimed responsibility for a series of coordinated suicide bomb attacks at two mosques in the Houthi-controlled capital of Sanaa. Four bombers wearing explosive belts targeted worshippers in and around the crowded mosques during Friday prayers killing 137 people and wounding 357. Although the location of the video, released on Friday, has yet to be confirmed, it is claimed to have been filmed near the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, which was captured by the Houthis last September. The nine-minute clip is similar to propaganda videos released by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, appearing to be shot and edited using professional equipment.

It starts with a masked man in sandals, sticking a black ISIS flag into the ground to 'declare the caliphate'. He announces that the 'soldiers of the Caliphate will cut the throats' of the Shi'ite Houthis, and 'take back the land they have occupied'. It then shows the two dozen men undergoing military training in the desert, and the fighters can be seen holding rifles and a grenade launcher, before firing some of the weapons in the sand. The possibility of ISIS gaining power in Yemen in the country's current state of chaos is particularly dangerous as one of the world's busiest oil shipping lanes is located off its coast. Yemen is currently on the brink of outright civil war, with several sides battling each other since the conflict began last year. Houthi rebels, backed by Shi'ite Iran, began their advance across Yemen by capturing the capital of Sanaa in September, later forcing President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi . into exile. Fighters loyal to former president Ali Abdullah Saleh have been battling alongside the Houthi rebels, with the Houthis, Saleh-loyalists and Hadi-loyalists all battling al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula(AQAP) in the south. Last month, an intervention led by Saudi Arabia was launched with the aim to restore Hadi and . prevent Yemen disintegrating as a state.

It's well known that exercise can make your muscles bigger. Now, a study has found it may make your brain larger, too. Physical activity can increase grey matter in the brain, increasing the size of areas that contribute to balance and coordination, according to Health Day news. The changes in the brain may have health implications in the long-term, such as reducing the risk of falling, said the study's author, Dr Urho Kujala, of the University of Jyvaskyla. Scroll down for video . Exercise can increase the size of areas of the brain that contribute to balance and coordination, a study found . It could also reduce the risk of being immobile in older age, he added. Dr Kujala said physical activity has already been linked to a number of health benefits, such as lower levels of body fat, reduced heart disease risk factors, better memory and thinking, and a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. But he and his team wanted to understand how exercise affects the brain. They recruited 10 pairs of identical twins, who were all men aged 32 to 36 years. Focusing on twins, who have the same DNA, would allow researchers to see how their environment affects their bodies. In each pair of twins, one brother had exercised more over the past three years than the other, though they reported they carried out similar levels of exercise earlier in their lives. Dr Kujala said: 'On average, the more active members of twin pairs were jogging three hours more per week compared to their inactive co-twins.' The twins had MRI scans of their brains so researchers could see whether physical activity had any impact on the size of their brains, and specific regions. Exercise didn't seem to affect the size of the brain as a whole, Dr Kujala said. But there was a connection between more activity and more brain volume in areas related to movement, he added. Previous research found exercise is linked to lower levels of body fat, a reduced risk of heart disease, better memory and thinking, and a lower risk of type 2 diabetes . The twins who exercised more did a better job of controlling their blood sugar, which reduces the risk of diabetes, a finding which is already well-known. The study was published in the journal Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise. It comes after US researchers found regular exercise can also make you smarter. University of South Carolina experts found regular treadmill sessions create more mitochondria - structures in the cells that produce the body's energy - in the brain. This energy boost helped the brain to work faster and more efficiently, effectively keeping it younger, researchers said. In the short term this could reduce mental fatigue and sharpen your thinking in between gym sessions. And building up a large reservoir of mitochondria in the brain could also create a 'buffer' against age-related brain diseases such as Alzheimer's.
A Liberal mayor who wrote a glowing reference for a convicted rapist asking for him to be spared jail is developing a program to teach young women about 'risky behaviour'. Eastern Sydney's Waverley mayor Sally Betts wrote a reference for Luke Lazarus 'out of loyalty to the family' after he raped an 18-year-old woman in an alleyway outside his father's SOHO nightclub, in Sydney. Now the controversial councillor is developing 'a new risky behaviour education program to try and help young women understand and better deal with being in vulnerable situations'. In an interview with the Wentworth Courier she referenced the behaviour of Lazarus's victim. The Mayor of three years said: 'By the sheer fact of (the assault) happening at a nightclub and alcohol is involved, (means people are) open to the possibility of risky behaviour, so I'm saying let's try and close that loophole.' Daily Mail Australia has contacted Cr Betts for comment. Waverley mayor Sally Betts wrote a reference for convicted rapist Luke Lazarus and is now developing 'a new risky behaviour education program' for young women . Cr Betts is reportedly developing the program for school girls alongside Waverley Action for Youth Services (WAYS) and the police. Lazarus, a 23-year-old former private school boy, was jailed for at least three years on March 27 after he raped the teenage virgin in an alleyway. During Lazarus's trial, the jury was told that he boasted to the victim he could introduce her to the DJ at his father's club, the SOHO, before he ushered her into the alleyway. The court heard that during the assault he pulled her stockings down, ignored a second request by her to leave and said in an authoritative tone 'put your f***ing hands on the wall, get on the floor and arch your back'. When it was over Lazarus told her to add her name to a list of conquests in his phone that he had. In a text message to a friend the afternoon after the attack, in the early hours of May 12, 2013, Lazarus said: 'I honestly have zero recollection of calling you ... Was a sick night – took a chick's virginity.' During Luke Lazarus's rape trial, the jury were told he boasted to the victim he could introduce her to the DJ at the SOHO, before he ushered her into an alleyway . Luke Lazarus was sentenced on March 27 for raping an 18-year-old at his father's SOHO nightclub on May 12, 2013 . His friend replied: 'bahahahaha nice popping does cherries ... ' Lazarus replied: '... it's a pretty gross story tell ya later'. In sentencing him, Judge Sarah Huggett found the offence was not premeditated but said he was reckless. 'I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt he must have realised there was a possibility she wasn't consenting,' she told Sydney's District Court. But she said he was 'not caring in one way or another whether she was consenting'. Sally Betts has been the Mayor of Waverley for three years in Sydney's eastern suburbs . Cr Betts said in the character reference she wrote for Lazarus that his conviction was 'inconsistent with the gentle well-mannered and respectful young man that I know'. She also said she had no hesitation supporting Lazarus and his family. In a recent interview with the Wentworth Courier she said she wrote the reference in support of Lazarus's grandparents whom she has been friends with for 30 years. 'They are shocked and devastated and I wrote in support of them,' she said. Australia's first Minister for the Prevention of Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Pru Goward slammed the public figures in the local community who supported Lazarus. Along with Cr Betts, the honorary secretary of the Honorary Consulate-General of Greece in Brisbane, Tsambico K Athanasas, South Sydney Rabbitohs rugby league club chairman Nick Pappas and the parish priest at the Greek Orthodox Christian Church of St George, Rose Bay, Father Gerasimos Koutsouras, spoke out to support him. 'Not only does this diminish their standing, it can shatter the confidence of the victim and often discourages them from seeking justice,' she said. On Thursday, Federal Member for Wentworth and Minister for Communications Malcolm Turnbull, whose electorate takes in Betts' council area, refused to endorse her to continue in her position. Turnbull's office declined to respond when probed by the Guardian over whether he would support her as mayor. A council investigation is currently underway to determine whether she broke the code of conduct. On Facebook a campaign page with over 200 likes has begun calling for her removal from office. 'As a community we must stand against our elected leaders supporting convicted rapists. Sally Betts Mayor of Waverley needs to know that she must go,' the page says. Last week, nightclub promoters apologised after a photo of a young woman sprawled out on a tiled-floor was used to advertise their Easter weekend event - just a week after Lazarus was convicted of raping a teenage girl at the venue. A photo of a 'drunken' young woman, lying with her legs apart on the ground, was posted on SOHO nightclub's Facebook page on April 3. The photo's caption said: 'We're throwing an extra special Yeezter event Tonight. Free entry till 10pm and $5 drinks till midnight – get amongst it!' Luke Lazarus will spend a minimum of three years behind bars. He told the court that attending his father's clubs gave him an 'inflated sense of power and entitlement' A photo of a drunken looking young woman, lying with her legs apart on the ground, was posted on SOHO nightclub's Facebook page on April 3 by an 'external promoter' The disturbing image was soon removed by the club's management after a backlash on Twitter, the Daily Life reports, with one shocked social media user complaining: 'This is how Luke Lazarus (sic) father promotes nightclub SOHO. Posted week after sentencing!'. A Twitter user told Daily Mail Australia : 'Once it did Twitter rounds and people started commenting it was removed by Saturday.' A SOHO management spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia: 'The event on the night was set up by an external promoter as a one-off event. 'He was given access to the official Facebook page but as soon as we noticed he'd put that up it was taken down.' The club agreed that the photo used was '100 per cent inappropriate'. The SOHO nightclub is a popular venue in Sydney's Kings Cross district . Judge Huggett said Lazarus, a South Sydney Rabbitohs fan, came from a privileged upbringing .
There is an image of Jose Mourinho and Pep Guardiola deep in conversation during a Barcelona training session that did the rounds on social media a few years ago. Mourinho was Bobby Robson’s assistant at Barcelona and Guardiola was in his final years as a player at the Camp Nou at the time. The picture became the perfect ‘guess the caption’ competition the best one having Guardiola say to Mourinho: ‘I’ll be Barça coach one day and I’ll win the treble’ and Mourinho replying: ‘yeah right, and I’ll manage Real Madrid.’ Jose Mourinho and Pep Guardiola in deep conversation following a Barcelona training session . No sooner had Luis Enrique joined Barcelona at the start of this season and the photo libraries threw up an even better shot – one of Luis Enrique, Pep and Jose in their time at Barcelona. Then the archive scanners began to notice something about some of the other faces in the pictures from this era – isn’t that current PSG coach Laurent Blanc? And isn’t that current Porto coach Julen Lopetegui? And aren’t four of the coaches of the last eight in this season’s Champions League from the same club at the same time? (From L-R) Barcelona's Juan Carlos Busquets, Luis Enrique, Mourinho and Guardiola at training . Laurent Blanc comes up against Enrique at the Parc des Princes on Wednesday in the Champions League . Blanc was a huge part of the Barcelona XI that won the Spanish Super Cup under Bobby Robson in 1996 . Luis Enrique comes face to with Blanc in the Parc des Princes stadium on Wednesday night and both will have plenty to catch up on. They were both in the Barça team that started the 1996-97 season by winning the Spanish Super Cup against Atletico Madrid 6-4 on aggregate. With Robson in charge and Mourinho’s assisting him the team that won the first silverware of the new season included not just the French World Cup winner and the 62-times Spain international and the aforementioned Lopetegui and Guardiola but Albert Ferrer, who started the season as Cordoba coach; Abelardo Fernandez, who is now coaching Sporting Gijon in Spain’s second tier; and Sergi Barjuan, who has just taken over at Almeria. The Barcelona XI that won the Spanish Super Cup under Bobby Robson in 1996 is breeding managers . Guardiola takes on former Barcelona team-mate Julen Lopetegui who is currently Porto manager . Albert Ferrer, seen battling Pedrag Mijatovic for the ball, went on to coach Spanish side Cordoba . Bobby Robson and Bulgarian defender Hristo Stoichkov celebrate victory against Real Betis . Also in the team were Hristo Stoichkov who has coached Celta Vigo and Bulgaria among others and Juan Antonio Pizzi, who managed Valencia last season and is now at Leon in Mexico. Even those players from that team who never went on to manage have stayed in football with Giovanni now working as a scout for Olympiakos and Guillermo Amor a former director of Barcelona’s youth academy who is now director of football at Adelaide United FC. Among the squad players that season were Roberto Prosinecki and Emmanuel Amunike now coach with Azerbaijan and Nigeria’s Under-17s teams respectively. Former Barcelona 1996 squad player Lopetegui is currently manager of Portuguese giants Porto . Michael Laudrup (left) and Ronald Koeman both went on to manager Premier League clubs . Enrique travels to Paris to take on Blanc's PSG side at the Parc des Princes in the Champions League . Ahead of his meeting with Blanc on Wednesday, Luis Enrique crossed swords with old friend and former team-mate Sergi Barjuan two weeks ago when Barça played Almeria. “It was the last thing we looked like becoming,” he said when I asked the Barcelona manager if both he and Sergi had looked like coaches-in-waiting in their playing days. “You change the way you look at things once you retire.” Luis Enrique believes those who played in positions where they had the pitch in front of them for most of the game – the full-backs, the centre-backs, Pep Guardiola in holding midfield – went on to coach in part because of how tactically astute they had had to become to be successful in their positions as players. Former Argentinean striker Juan Antonio Pizzi went on to manage Valencia and is now in Mexico . Julen Lopetegui: Porto boss . Albert Ferrer: Former Cordoba coach . Gheorghe Popescu: Jailed for money laundering . Abelardo Fernandez: Sporting Gijon coach . Laurent Blanc: PSG boss . Luis Enrique: Barcelona manager . Sergi Barjuan: Almeria coach . Guillermo Amor: Adelaide United sporting director . Pep Guardiola: Bayern Munich coach . Hristo Stoichkov: Former Bulgaria and Celta Vigo coach . Juan Antonio Pizzi: Former Valencia boss now at Leon in Mexico . Andoni Zubizarreta: Former Sporting director at Barcelona . Albert Ferrer: Former Cordoba boss . Ronald Koeman: Southampton manager . Fernando Muñoz: No coaching roles . Eusebio: Former Barcelona  B boss . Pep Guardiola: Bayern Munich coach . Jose Mari Bakero: Coached at Malaga and Real Sociedad . Michael Laudrup: Former Swansea, Getafe and Mallorca coach . Juan Carlos: Coaching role at Valladolid . Julio Salinas: Television pundit . Hristo Stoichkov: Former Bulgaria and Celta Vigo coach . It’s perhaps more of a surprise that so many attacking players also graduated to the technical area. Some will have got jobs because they played for Barcelona rather than because of all they learned at Barça – it’s the irresistible pull of giving a Barça old boy a job in the hope he will be able to build a side in his former team’s image. But for every failure there has been a success and there is a 50 per cent chance that whoever wins this season’s Champions League, via the coach, Barcelona’s prints will be on the trophy.
With a possible 11 games left to their season Barcelona’s front three of Leo Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar are just seven goals short of clocking up a century in their first season together. The three amigos will match the total scored by Thierry Henry, Samuel Eto’o and Messi in 2009 if they reach 100 goals and they will inevitably fuel the debate that they are fast becoming the greatest front three in Barcelona’s history. Henry scored 26, Eto’o 36 and Messi 38 goals in the 2008-09 season. In this campaign Messi has 46, Neymar 28 and Suarez 19 despite missing the first three months through suspension. Scroll down for video . Lionel Messi, Neymar Jnr and Luis Suarez are seven goals short of reaching 100 for the season . Messi rounds Valencia goalkeeper Diego Alves to score during Barcelona's 2-0 win on Saturday . Suarez celebrates with Neymar and Messi after netting the opener against Valencia in the La Liga clash . Gareth Bale with 17, Cristiano Ronaldo with 50, and Karim Benzema 22, have 86 between them for Real Madrid but the question is no longer can Messi, Suarez and Neymar out-do their La Liga rivals, rather can they out-do the greatest forward lines in Barcelona’s history? The Henry/Eto’o/Messi forward line won the 2009 European Cup and was followed two years later – after the failed attempt to bring Zlatan Ibrahimovic into the mix in 2010 – by the Messi/David Villa/Pedro strike force that also won a European Cup against Manchester United in 2011. They scored 98 goals in the 2010-11 season with Messi getting 53, Villa 23 and Pedro 21. Both attacks had a tendency to come good in the Clasicos with the Henry/Eto’o/Messi strikeforce playing in one of the most famous Real Madrid-Barcelona games of all time in 2009 with Barca winning 6-2 at the Bernabeu and Henry and Messi both scored twice. Messi celebrates with Thierry Henry after Barcelona won the Champions League in 2009 . The Argentine congratulates team-mate Samuel Eto'o after he scores in the Champions League final in 2009 . The current combination lacks the European Cup the other two have and a big win over Real Madrid but there is still time for them to combine the two with a Clasico final still a possibility. When they first came together at the start of the season there was the fear among Barcelona supporters that the team would not be big enough for the three of them. Barça legend Johan Cruyff had already warned a year early that ‘a ship cannot have two captains’ and that Neymar and Messi would not get on. When Suarez was introduced that was, for some, another reason to believe Luis Enrique would have problems. But nothing could have been further from the truth. Suarez has had his fair share of highly controversial incidents but has never been a bad influence in the dressing room. In Monday’s training session at Barça’s Sports City he received a playful knee between the legs from Neymar in a light-hearted training session ahead of tonight’s game. His relationship with the Brazilian is good; and with Messi’s it’s even better. After a slow start to his Barca career Suarez has now scored 19 goals despite missing the first months of the season through suspension . Messi celebrates with Suarez after the Uruguay international netted against Valencia . Messi never saw eye to eye with David Villa or Ibrahimovic and both were put out at times at having to play second fiddle to the four times Balon d’Or winner but after a season accommodating Daniel Sturridge's preference for playing through the middle, the demands of Messi have not been a problem for Suarez. The training-ground chemistry has been good and has translated on to the pitch. Goals statistics aside Barcelona have always boasted brilliant front threes. Messi was first thrust into a forward line that boasted Ronaldinho and Eto’o and they won the Champions League in 2004 against Arsenal. Hristo Stoichkov, Michael Laudrup and Romario was Johan Cruyff’s Dream Team front three in the 1993-94 season but their time together was brief and they never won the European Cup – losing 4-0 to Milan with Laudrup on the bench. If this season ends with Messi, Suarez and Neymar smashing the 100 goals barrier and lifting the trophy in Berlin no other forward line in Barcelona’s history will be able to touch them.
An unknown man's theft of a Texas neighborhood's wild peacock was caught on camera by surveillance video as he roughly handled the beautiful bird. Residents of Beckley Club Estates in Dallas, Texas, say that they saw a man approach a male peacock, who was in the middle of its mating ritual and had unfurled its full plumage, before quickly snatching him up on Saturday. Footage from the home of Lisa Solis shows the thief grab the animal by both its claws before shoving him in his black SUV around 7pm. Residents of a Dallas neighborhood saw a man approach a male peacock, who was in the middle of its mating ritual and had unfurled its full plumage, before quickly snatching him up on Saturday . The man is seen bending down and picking up the bird by its claws before shoving it into his black Chevy Tahoe with its feathers sticking out of the door . Solis's neighbor Tisha Crear said she saw the event, and rushed out of the house and yelled at the man, but could only watch as he drove off with half of the peacock's feathers hanging out of the door. Ms Crear said that she had heard peahens screaming before the incident when the bird, the largest and oldest male peacock of those that live in the subdivision, was stolen, according to NBC Dallas. Ms Solid called the theft and aggressive treatment of the bird animal cruelty. 'Do I need to sit on the porch with a shotgun or what do I have to do? Because we are going to protect the peacocks,' Ms Crear said, holding a feather from the stolen bird. Residents of the neighborhood, where peacocks have lived for the past 20 years, filed a report to the police about the missing animal . Surveillance video also shows the black Chevy Tahoe driver stalking the birds for 20 minutes before he grabbed his target. The suspect is described as a Hispanic man who was wearing shorts, a white shirt and a baseball cap. Peacocks have lived in the neighborhood for 20 years, according to the Dallas Morning News. Residents, who have reported the incident to police, are also worried about the birds' long term survival if the peacock patriarch is not able to return and fertilize eggs. Neighbors have previously organized to protect the animals following one resident's complaint.
A runner up of Brazil's Miss BumBum competition has branded the contest's winner 'an attention-seeking sl*t' after she posted a photograph of her naked body painted with an image of the Virgin Mary for Easter. Claudia Alende, 21, who came second in last year's beauty pageant, launched a scathing attack on current title-holder Indianara Carvalho, claiming the model had 'revealed  who she truly is'. Miss Carvalho, 23, posted the racy picture to her Instagram account on Good Friday - the day the country's 130million Catholics solemnly remembered the crucifixion and death of Christ. Scroll down for video . Racy: Indianara Carvalho posted the picture of her naked body painted with an image of the Virgin Mary on Good Friday . Slammed: Claudia Alende, who came second in the competition, launched a scathing attack on Miss Carvalho . The image, one of a series of nude shots she shared over the Easter weekend, was accompanied with a prayer which including the words: 'Good Friday. Lord, on this day I ask for peace, love, wisdom and strength'. But the paintings - created by Brazilian spray-paint artist Binho over 10 hours - prompted a tirade of disapproval from her followers, many of whom accused the Miss BumBum winner of disrespect and religious sacrilege. Ms Alende, the competition's vice champion,  better known as the Brazilian 'Megan Fox', today waded into the furore, claiming she had been left 'shocked and ashamed' by her rival's risqué Easter stunt. Speaking exclusively to MailOnline, Ms Alende, a Catholic, claimed she had also been asked to do the photoshoot but refused 'out of respect for God and for my family'. She said: 'It was a ridiculous thing to do, I actually feel ashamed for her.' Claudia Alende, 21, who came second in last year's beauty pageant, is known as the Brazilian Megan Fox . Ms Alende, better known as the Brazilian 'Megan Fox', claims she had been left 'shocked and ashamed' by her rival's risqué Easter stunt . Ms Alende said: 'I've always known that the woman is an attention-seeking sl*t, and now she's revealing to everyone else who she truly is' 'Our Lady is a holy figure, and for many the most important figure in their lives,' she added. 'To paint her across your naked body, especially on Good Friday, shows a breathtaking lack of respect and judgement. 'Like most other people, I was shocked when I saw the photos. I was actually embarrassed for her, even though she has no shame herself. 'I think in her head she doesn't care if it makes people talk well or talk badly of her. She just wants people to talk about her. She thinks that any kind of publicity is a good thing. 'I've always known that the woman is an attention-seeking sl*t, and now she's revealing to everyone else who she truly is.' Brazilian beauty: Ms Alende claims Miss Carvalho has 'revealed who she truly is' by posting the naked shots . Ms Alende believes the publicity stunt is already backfiring - and called on Brazilians to boycott her rival . The Miss BumBum runner-up told MailOnline 'It was a ridiculous thing to do, I actually feel ashamed for her' Ms Alende said the current Miss BumBum - who had hymen surgery last year to 'restore' her virginity so she could enjoy her first time again with 'someone special' - never deserved to win the coveted title last November. She said: 'I honestly have no idea how she won. She is too muscly, it means her body is ugly, she certainly doesn't represent the Brazilian woman.' And she believes the publicity stunt is already backfiring - and called on Brazilians to boycott her. 'She has made people see her in a negative way, so many are losing respect for her and interest in her too,' Ms Alende added. 'She is losing her credibility, and will lose work too. 'I think anyone who was shocked by her lack of respect for Christianity and the Virgin Mary should boycott her, including magazines and companies that might have used her image on their pages or to sell their products.'

Another, Cadmo Barrera Lerma ranted: 'You have lost my total respect, at least one in your list of followers.' Janvier Veliz Angulo added: 'This proves that beauty is not everything… you have lost me as one of your fans.' Referring to Miss Carvalho's accompanying prayer, another user fumed: 'I think that to ask for peace and love and protection there is no need to be naked!!!! Please respect things related to God!' Happy Easter: This was another of the raunchy photographs posted on social media by the Miss BumBum winner . Miss Carvalho's lengthy prayer also stated: 'Father, protect my ears from all evils and watch my steps on the path to truth'' The 2014 contest was marred by scandal after it was alleged that Miss Carvalho had bribed the judges with over £70,000 in cash to make sure she won . Christianity is the dominant religion in Brazil, with Roman Catholics accounting for 64 per cent of the population and Protestants making up 22 per cent, according to the latest Census. Miss Carvalho's lengthy prayer also stated: 'Father, protect my ears from all evils and watch my steps on the path to truth. 'May your blessings fill my spirit and my heart, which is so kind and cheerful... Feel your sweet and gentle presence... I am your grace.' The buxom blonde triumphed in Brazil's annual bottom beauty contest last year, which sees 27 women - one from each state - complete to prove their backside is best. Miss BumBum, which began four years ago and has several spin-offs, is an annual institution in its native Brazil, although not always without controversy. The 2014 contest was marred by scandal after it was alleged that Miss Carvalho had bribed the judges with over £70,000 in cash to make sure she won.

Burnley manager Sean Dyche has dismissed speculation linking him with Derby. Recent reports claimed Dyche has been lined up as a possible successor to Steve McClaren, who is the bookmakers' favourite to take over at Newcastle. Dyche says he remains committed to the task in hand at Turf Moor, though. Burnley manager Sean Dyche, aka The Ginger Mourinho, insists he is enjoying life at Turf Moor . The Clarets earned a point in a goalless draw with Tottenham but remain fixed in the relegation zone . 'I think it's quite obvious, I am enjoying the challenge here. I am not looking further afield,' the Burnley boss said. 'I am enjoying the challenge here.' Dyche has retained the support of the Burnley fans throughout the season even though the club are now second from bottom with just seven matches to go. Dyche has been tipped to replace former England manager Steve McClaren (right) at Derby . The same cannot be said for the man who will be in the away dugout at Turf Moor this weekend, though. Some Arsenal fans called for Arsene Wenger's head following a difficult start to the season. Dyche remains a big fan of the Gunners boss and cannot comprehend why there were calls for the three-time Premier League winner to be sacked. 'They're a fine side, who keep progressing despite what people say,' said Dyche, who took Burnley up last year after finishing second in the Sky Bet Championship. The Burnley boss cannot believe that some Gunners fans were calling for Arsene Wenger to be sacked . 'Arsene seems to get questioned, I don't know why, I think the job he's done is terrific. 'Of course, I'm aware fans would like to have won more trophies in recent years but, as a young manager aspiring to progress in the game, I look at people like him thinking 'you haven't done badly if you have a career like his'.' Dyche hopes Matt Taylor (Achilles), Ross Wallace (knee) and Steven Reid (calf) will be fit for the visit of the Gunners, who have won their last seven games in all competitions.
A Muslim women's rights advocate and outspoken critic of Islam has championed the U.S. as the best country in the world to live as a  woman and as a black person. Somali-born author Ayaan Hirsi Ali, 45, emigrated to America in 2006 after facing death threats in the Netherlands, where she had been a member of parliament and a target for extremists after renouncing her faith and becoming an atheist. Hirsi Ali, who describes herself as a liberal, has accused her fellow liberals of failing to have a proper sense of perspective about life in the U.S. and for not being more critical of Islam. Muslim women's rights advocate and outspoken critic of Islam Ayaan Hirsi Ali has championed the U.S. as the best country in the world to live as a woman and as a black person . 'We are so blessed as women to live in the United States. The best place to be a woman in the world is in the U.S. The best place to be black in the world is in the U.S.,' she told The Daily Beast. 'Is it perfect? No. Are we confronted with threats? Yes. But it's the perfect place to fight [them] off.' Ali said that the law in the U.S. and the fact that the majority of the population are accepting of differences make it easier for all types of minority groups including woman, black people, gays and Jews. 'I cannot imagine what it is like to be a black man living in Saudi Arabia, in Iran - even where the majority of people are black, like Africa,' she said. 'I cannot imagine a better place to be gay than in the U.S. I know that all European countries have accepted gay marriage and here in the U.S. we're still struggling to accept that. 'On the other hand, when the jihadists in Europe attack gays in the streets, the governments don't protect them. 'The best place to be Jewish in the world, besides the state of Israel, is in the U.S. The best place to be Christian is in the U.S.' Hirsi Ali was raised in a strict Muslim family, but after surviving a civil war, genital mutilation, beatings and an arranged marriage, she renounced the faith in her 30s. Hirsi Ali is married to British historian and public commentator Niall Ferguson, right, who left his wife of sixteen year for the Somali intellectual . Hirsi Ali releases her new book, Heretic: Why Islam Needs A Reformation Now, later this month . In 2007, she helped establish the AHA Foundation, which works to protect and defend the rights of women in the West from oppression justified by religion and culture, according to its website. The foundation also strives to protect basic rights and freedoms of women and girls. This includes control of their own bodies, access to an education and the ability to work outside the home and control their own income, the website says. Hirsi Ali told The Daily Beast that in comparison to the rest of the world woman in the West have little to complain about. 'Listen, if you're not allowed into a golf club, that doesn't sit well with me, but if I were to prioritize, I would say: This girl, she's just been denied her right to school, she's just been forced into marriage, she's just been genitally mutilated. That's the sort of thing that we need to be, as women, signing up against.' Hirsi Ali releases her new book, Heretic: Why Islam Needs A Reformation Now, later this month. The book includes her thoughts on the January shootings in Paris at the offices of the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo. Her previous books include the best-selling memoir Infidel. She has written and spoken extensively of her experience as a Muslim girl in East Africa. She moved to the Netherlands as a young woman, and she was later elected to the Dutch Parliament. She wrote the screenplay for Submission, a 2004 film critical of the treatment of Muslim women. Shortly after its release, the director, Theo van Gogh, was murdered on an Amsterdam street by a radical Islamist, who also pinned to the victim's body a threat to kill Hirsi Ali. She is married to British historian and public commentator Niall Ferguson, who left his wife of sixteen year for the Somali intellectual. They married in September 2011 and Hirsi Ali gave birth to their son three months later.
An airport worker has been awarded $40 million in compensation for a freak runway accident which left him paralyzed from the waist down more than seven years ago. Brandon Afoa, 33, of Puyallup, Washington, was operating a tug to push aircraft at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport when the brakes and steering failed, causing him to crash into a luggage lift. The incident, which took place at 2am on December 26, 2007, left Afoa unable to use his legs or right arm. Much of his intestinal tract also had to be removed by surgeons. Afoa went on to sue Port of Seattle - which owns and operates the Sea-Tac airport - in King County Superior Court, saying that the company failed to maintain a safe workplace. Closure: An airport worker has been awarded $40 million in compensation for a freak runway accident which left him paralyzed from the waist down more than seven years ago . But for years the case was locked in the courts because the Port of Seattle claimed it wasn't liable for what happened as Afoa worked for a private firm. In a bid to move things forward, the state supreme court finally ruled in 2013 that the airport had a 'duty' to provide a safe working environment. On Tuesday a King County jury awarded Afoa $40 million because of what the incident has done to his life. Indeed, the paraplegic needs round-the-clock help from caregivers just to survive. In the courtroom a panel was shown video footage of Afoa being craned from his bed by a special lift to a commode and undergoing therapy. Jurors went on to apportion 25per cent of the blame for the accident to the Port of Seattle. Meanwhile, a number of airlines which weren’t part of the lawsuit will pay the rest of the money owed. This is because they had contracts with Afoa's previous employer - Evergreen Aviation Ground Logistics Enterprises - which has since gone out of business. Commenting on the outcome, Afoa told KOMO-TV: 'It was a relief and I'm very thankful for the jury for making an awesome decision.' In a statement, the Port of Seattle expressed its sympathies to Afoa and his family for the accident. The agency says it's reviewing the decision. If it decides to appeal the verdict, it could delay payment of Afoa's award.
Britain is on course to be the second fastest growing major economy in the world, in a major boost for George Osborne who said it was 'proof our economic plan is working'. The International Monetary Fund predicts the UK economy will grow by 2.7 per cent this year and 2.3 per cent in 2016, beaten only by the United States. It comes as the Tories were buoyed by the news that inflation remains at zero per cent, with food and fuel prices down sharply year on year. Britain is on course to be the second fastest growing major economy in the world, in a major boost for George Osborne. The International Monetary Fund predicts the UK economy will grow by 2.7 per cent this year and 2.3 per cent in 2016, beaten only by the United States . Low oil prices are expected to help bolster steady growth in the UK. In its latest World Economic Outlook, the IMF predicted world growth of 3.5 per cent this year, unchanged from its previous projection in January. Its forecast for UK growth this year remains at 2.7 per cent though for next year it is cut from 2.4 per cent to 2.3 per cent. It said: 'In the United Kingdom, lower oil prices and improved financial market conditions are expected to support continued steady growth.' Chancellor George Osborne told MailOnline: 'These IMF growth forecasts for the UK are further proof our economic plan is working. 'But this growth, and the jobs and security it brings, would all be put at risk with the chaos of an Ed Miliband/Scottish Nationalist government. 'So we must keep on working through our economic plan and finish the job. 'This is the only way to deliver an economy that offers working people security at every stage of their lives.' David Cameron today warned that growth in the UK could be put at risk if the Tories are not returned to power. He urged voters to 'see this plan through and Britain will keep exporting, growing, job-creating, and yes – we'll be back in the black but only if Conservatives are back in Government'. He added: 'The next five years are much, much more important than the past five. Because having rescued our economy and set Britain back on her feet, now is our chance to truly finish the job, to make this a country where those who work hard and do the right thing can enjoy a good life.' David Cameron today warned that growth in the UK could be put at risk if the Tories are not returned to power . The IMF said global expansion this year 'will be driven by a rebound in advanced economies supported by the decline in oil prices'. But global prospects were 'uneven' with growth slipping back in emerging economies. There would be weaker activity for some major oil exporters, with the Russian economy - also hit by tensions over Ukraine - expected to shrink by 3.8 per cent this year, worse than the previously estimated 3 per cent. The IMF said that while risks to global growth 'are now more balanced' than six months ago, they 'remain tilted to the downside'. These included the danger of low inflation in countries saddled by high debt, with the warning coming on the same day that official figures showed inflation falling to minus 0.01 per cent in the UK. Inflation remained at a record low of zero per cent for the second consecutive month, official figures revealed this morning . Inflation remained at a record low of zero per cent for the second consecutive month, official figures revealed this morning. It means that in the 12 months to March family living costs have not risen at all – while at the same time people's pay jumped by 1.8 per cent. Prices are being held down by the falling cost of food, fuel and women's clothes, the office for national statistics said this morning. Petrol prices fell by 13.7 per cent over the year to March, but saw a slight increase between February and March. The average petrol price rose by 3.8p per litre between February and March. The biggest price falls came from clothing and footwear which fell by 0.1 per cent between February and March. This is the first time that prices have fallen between February and March since month-on-month inflation was first measured. Normally prices rise as they recover following the January sales period. IMF chief economist Olivier Blanchard said: 'A number of complex forces are shaping the prospects around the world. 'Legacies of both the financial and euro area crises - weak banks and high levels of public, corporate, and household debt - are still weighing on spending and growth in some countries.' The outlook for the US this year has been slashed by 0.5 per cent to 3.1 per cent while for the eurozone it has been upgraded from 1.2 per cent to 1.5 per cent, helped by low oil prices and a weaker single currency amid a 1.1 trillion euro (£790 billion) stimulus programme. The IMF still said conditions were ripe for 'robust US economic performance in 2015' but pointed to risks such as the strong dollar hitting exports and the low oil price suppressing investment in that sector. It said macroeconomic risks to global growth, such as a recession in the eurozone, had slightly decreased, but that financial and geopolitical risks had increased. The latter included below-target inflation in countries with high debt and low growth since the financial crisis, with little room to provide more monetary stimulus. The report said: 'Stagnation and low inflation in advanced economies, notwithstanding the recent upgrade to the near-term growth forecasts for some of these economies, could hamper the recovery.' It said prospects for some economies were 'clouded' by ageing populations, weak investment and lacklustre productivity growth as well as high debt both among governments and in the private sector. The report added: 'Inflation and inflation expectations in most advanced economies are below target and are in some cases still declining - a particular concern for countries with crisis legacies of high debt and low growth, and little or no room to ease monetary policy.' Financial risks could also include a further surge in the US dollar and strong market reactions as 'accommodative' monetary policies supporting recovery - such as low interest rates and money printing - start to be withdrawn. Geopolitical risks included tensions 'stemming from ongoing events in Ukraine, the Middle East and West Africa' which 'could generate regional and global spillover'.
Kenny Jackett has told his Wolves players they must maintain their focus and follow up victory over Nottingham Forest with another over Leeds United on Monday. The Wolves boss believes it is now just the top eight in the Sky Bet Championship who are fighting it out for the play-off places, with their 2-1 success at the City Ground all but ending the Reds' chances of making a late push. Wolves were fired on by a goal just 30 seconds into the second half from Benik Afobe, followed by a Bakary Sako penalty in the 72nd minute. Dexter Blackstock pulled one back for Forest four minutes into injury time, but it was too little, too late. Bakary Sako celebrates after scoring Wolves' second goal in a 2-1 win at Nottingham Forest on Good Friday . Manager Kenny Jackett has told his side that they need to keep their focus to maintain a promotion push . And Jackett does not want Wolves to let their promotion push slip away now, saying: We just need to keep winning our games and not worry about other sides. It looks like the top eight will be involved now, although I don't know if Forest will have an opinion on that. 'We have to follow this win up with another against Leeds now, there will be a big crowd at Molineux and we have to focus on that now. 'The mood is very determined, there is good focus among the players and we are keen to keep improving.' Jackett was particularly delighted for Afobe, who he had previously taken on loan at Millwall, saying: 'He is repaying our faith but we worked together at Millwall and I am delighted to have him permanently now. He was ready for a permanent home. Dougie Freedman believes the difference between the two sides was a simple composure in front of goal . 'I'm delighted to have won. I felt that Forest put us under a lot of pressure in the first 20 minutes, a lot of energy, the crowd were right behind them. We defended well in that period, very well. Then we came through it and started to look a threat ourselves. 'Then just after half time, Afobe's scored a fantastic goal that, in a tight game, has put our noses in front. After that we were very professional, we got the second goal, we needed it and it was a good overall performance.' Forest boss Dougie Freedman says the difference between the two sides was simple composure in front of goal. Wolves striker Afobe (centre) is mobbed by his team-mates after putting them ahead in the second half . 'The difference was that they took their chances when they came along. There was not a lot in it, they just took their chances when they came their way,' he said. 'When they scored just after half time, our team talk went out the window. But you have to take your chances against the top sides and we had plenty of them. 'The ability to take chances is what cost us in the end. They took theirs and we did not make the most of ours. Afobe made the difference, because he took his goal superbly. 'We had opportunities to win the game, we had sustained pressure on their goal. But we did not have the cutting edge we needed.'
Officially it's known as a 'forward three-and-a-half somersaults with one twist pike' but unofficially it's the 'firework' and Tom Daley hopes it's the dive that turns London bronze into Rio gold. The former world champion knows he needs to push the boundaries of his sport and spent most of last year battling to master his 'demon' dive, a dizzying combination of somersaults and twists he had hoped would prove the difference. However, along with new coach Jane Figueiredo he spent the winter modifying a new plunge, something that has never been attempted before. Daley spent long hours on the trampoline perfecting technique before building the dive in stages from different heights. Tom Daley hopes his new 'firework' dive can help win Olympic gold at the 2016 Rio de Janiero Games . It was painstaking and detailed work but the dive finally got its premiere at the British Championships and was part of Daley's repertoire when he won silver, with a personal best score, at the recent World Diving Series in Dubai. 'There was a sense of relief when we decided to bin the old dive but the pressure was on to come up with something,' admitted Daley. 'The old dive did terrify me and while I did conquer my demons with it, it's a weight off my shoulders that I've moved on because it was a bad dive for me. 'We wanted to do the least twist possible because I hate the twisting part. We've only got one twist in this dive so we had to decide whether we were going to do it at the beginning or at the end because you can do that dive three different ways. 'We tried doing it at the beginning but it made the dive really hard because the G-force getting into your pike shape is really difficult. 'We go through 20 Gs of force as we're spinning around so at the end we decided to do it on the way out. So you spin as fast as you can and then you come out at the end, do one twist then land in the water.' Daley (right) has spent the winter modifying the plunge with his new coach Jane Figueiredo . It's six years since Daley won his breakthrough world title in Rome, one year after making his Olympic debut as a 14-year old in Beijing. Last year there were inaccurate reports that Daley was to call time on his diving career but he insists he's enjoying the sport more than ever, following the decision to relocate from Plymouth to London. His home pool is now the Olympic pool, a place with happy memories, and he'll be the star attraction at next month's FINA Diving World Series, 1-3 May in his newly-adopted hometown. But Daley is no longer the sole standard bearer for British diving, Jack Laugher became the first non-Chinese diver to win on the World Series this year in Dubai and Tonia Couch and synchro partner Sarah Barrow are also established among the world's elite. 'I have never loved diving as much as I do now and I want to stay in diving for as long as I possibly can,' added Daley. The 20-year-old says he is enjoying diving more than ever after relocating from Plymouth to London . 'With the move to London it has become exciting again. Especially with the new dive, there are new challenges and new obstacles to overcome. 'It's been great having Jane on board, we've had a year and three months working together now. 'There's little things that we've changed – the strength and conditioning, the way that we work in the pool, the way we work in the gym but it's really working out. 'British diving is the strongest it's ever been and we are all really excited about coming back to London and competing in our own pool. 'We know in London that we always get a crowd that's loud. It's normally a sell-out and the atmosphere is a bit more electric than anyone else, it gives you that extra adrenaline rush and, in theory, it should get us to dive a little bit better.' And Daley hopes his new dive will bring victory at next month's FINA Diving World Series in London . But Daley's key ambition for the season in this summer's World Championships in Kazan. Since striking gold in Rome, he has settled for a fifth and sixth at the event, a record he concedes must change. His rivals will be the normal suspects, reigning champion Qiu Bo, Olympic champion David Boudia and Germany's Sascha Klein. 'The build up to Rio is going pretty well,' he added. 'It's got a lot of competitions leading up to it and the worlds will be our first chance to qualify. 'London is one of the key parts of the diving calendar this year because it's the middle part of the World Series. So it's a really good marker to see how the new dive's going and how all of that is piecing together and it's exactly the half-way mark competition wise so I'm really looking forward to it.'

It has been a key part school chemistry lessons for more than a century, but now the periodic table may need to be redrawn after scientists found a rare element may be very different from originally thought. Researchers have for the first time been able to test how much energy is required to strip an electron from an atom of the radioactive element lawrencium. The rare metal currently sits at the very bottom of the periodic table at the end of a group of elements known as the actinides, which sit in a separate block from the main table. But the results of new research suggest the element may have properties similar to sodium and potassium, which may fuel arguments that it would be better placed in the main body the periodic table. Lawrencium, marked as Lr on the periodic table above, currently sits in a separate block from the main table . If it is redraw, it means that chemistry students could have to relearn the order of how the elements appear. Lawrencium, which was first discovered in 1961 by the nuclear scientist Ernest Lawrence, is notoriously difficult to make and only  exists for a few seconds at a time. This has made the element, which can only be generated in particle accelerators, extremely difficult to study. There are several newly discovered atoms that currently do not appear on the periodic table. Two years ago scientists claimed to have discovered the existence of a new atom with an atomic number of 115. This makes it one of the heaviest chemical elements detected to date and does not occur naturally. Instead scientists had to synthesis it in the laboratory by bombarding a film of another heavy element known as americium with calcium ions. The resulting element lasted for just a fraction of a second before it decaying into more commonly found elements. Although still to be officially named, it has been given the temporary name of ununpentium. The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry has also recently announced that nineteen elements have had their atomic weights reassessed. Among those to have had their standard atomic weights adjusted are elements like aluminium, fluorine, arsenic, caesium, cadmium and selenium. While some of the atoms were found to have an average weight that was a tiny fraction greater than previously calculated, others decreased. Overall the total atomic weight displayed on the periodic table increased by 0.003640021 as a result of the changes. But now researchers at the Japan Atomic Energy Agency have been able to create enough to measured the ionisation potential of lawrencium for the first time. Speaking to Chemistry world, Yuichiro Nagame, a researcher at the Japan Atomic Engery Agency who took part in the study, said: ‘[Lutetium and lawrencium] – the last column of lanthanides and actinides – could be put into the group III column of the periodic table, under scandium and yttrium.’ The current structure of the periodic table was drawn up in 1945 after the Nobel-prize winning chemist Glenn Seaborg suggested the actinides - rare radioactive elements - belonged in a separate part of the table which is known as 'f-block'. However, some chemists have argued that placing lawrencium at the end of this block was incorrect and they should be put in the 'd-block' of the main table. Dr William Jensen, a chemist at the University of Cincinnati, argues that along with lutetium, lawrencium is misplaced in the f-block. In a paper published in the journal Foundations of Chemistry last month, he said: 'Though there are many misconceptions concerning the nature and function of the periodic law and table, perhaps the most prevalent among modern chemists is the belief that the periodic table is nothing more than an electron configuration table. 'While there is certainly a significant correlation between electron configurations and chemical periodicity, the correlation is far from perfect. 'Lutetium and lawrencium, rather than Lanthanum and Actinium, should be assigned to the d-block as the heavier analogs of Scandium and Yttrium, whereas Lanthanum and Actinium should be considered as the first members of the f-block with irregular configurations.' Lawrencium, represented by the diagram left, was discovered by nuclear scientist Ernest Lawrence (right) Lawrencium was first generated by Ernest Lawrence by bombarding californium atoms with boron atoms to create the new superheavy element. However, scientists have only ever been able to produce minuscule amounts of the substance and it has a half life of 27 seconds. The new study, which is published in the journal Nature, used the same approach as Lawrence to create the element that bears his name but captured it in a helium and cadmium iodide gas. This was passed through a heated tantalum surface giving the short-lived lawrencium enough energy to shed its outer electron - the ionisation potential. The researchers found this matched a recent prediction of 4.96eV - giving it the lowest ionisation potential of all elements in the f-block. This representation of the periodic table shows the ionisation potential of elements following the new results . However, in a statement, the Japan Atomic Energy Agency said it did not feel it affected the structure of the periodic table. They said: 'Since the introduction of the 'actinide concept' as the most dramatic modern revision of the Periodic Table of the Elements by Glenn Seaborg in the 1940s, the element with atomic number 103, lawrencium (Lr), played a crucial role as the last element in the actinide series. 'We show that removing the outermost electron requires least energy in Lr among all actinides, as was expected. T . 'This validates the position of Lr as the last actinide element and confirms the architecture of the Periodic Table.' However, Dr Eric Scerri, a chemist and historian at the University of California Los Angeles, said the results supported the push to move lawrencium into the min part of the table. He said: 'If the periodic table is presented in the more correct 32-column or long-format, and if one maintains the order of increasing atomic numbers throughout the table, one is inevitably led to the conclusion that Lu and Lr belong to group 3 and that La and Ac should be placed at the start of the f-block elements.' Despite the debate the result is likely to now generate, Professor Andreas Türler, a chemist at the Albert Einstein Centre for Fundamental Physics at the University of Bern, Switzerland, described the experiment as 'spectacular'. The researchers were able to study lawrencium for the first time using an ionizer cavity (left) which revealed that the element has one of the lowest ionisation potentials of any of the atoms in the f-block (right)
The school exam season is nearly upon us; cue a nerve-jangling few months for parents and children alike. For many youngsters, the thought of a single desk with nothing more than a white paper on it and a ticking clock nearby fills them with dread. At best, students get jittery, at worst, their actual grade can be affected. A new survey by academics at Lancashire's Edge Hill University and the University of South Australia has charted a direct link between anxiety and performance, saying pupils who worry about their exam performance are more likely to do badly than those who are less anxious. Countdown to the exam season: A new study by Lancashire's Edge Hill University found a direct link between anxiety ahead of taking exams and grades achieved . The study, which has been published in the British Journal of Educational Psychology, questioned  705 pupils from 11 schools. Researcher Dr Dave Putwain, Reader in Education at Edge Hill University, said: 'There is no doubt that a high degree of worry over one’s performance, or the consequences of one´s performance, has a detrimental effect on GCSE results.' He continued: 'Our study, which was controlled for prior attainment and also how good students were at dealing with exam pressure, found that increased worry still predicted lower achievement.' With that in mind, how can you best ensure your offspring rides the exam storm and comes out the other end feeling happy and achieving what they'd hoped for? FEMAIL has enlisted the help of Michael Ribton, principal at Burlington Danes Academy in West London, which achieved an outstanding grade at its last OFSTED inspection, to offer some sage advice to parents and students on how to get through the tricky months ahead. If Ribton is more than used to getting teenagers to apply themselves in his day job, he's also used to it at home. This summer, his son Joe, 18, will sit A levels, while his daughter Maddy, 16, will take her GCSES. He says: 'Our May half-term holiday has been cancelled so that they are free to get on with revision. 'Their bedrooms are adorned with flashcards and files; their revision timetables and exam timetables are on display in the kitchen. It’s a busy time!' Principal at Burlington Danes Academy Michael Ribton, pictured above (left) helping a pupil to revise, says parents should pin their offspring's revision timetable on the fridge and really engage with them during the lead up to the stressful exam period . Here, he offers his essential guide to how to ease the passage of students bound for the exam hall: . DEVISE A BESPOKE REVISION PLAN THAT INCLUDES REWARDS OF TIME OFF . 'Draw up a revision timetable and stick to it. 'Set yourself goals and reward yourself with time off. A common error is forgetting to add up your cumulative hours on each subject so that you are not overly focusing on one subject. 'Parents need to be part of this as well. A revision timetable should be on the fridge at home! 'Students also need to find the way that suits them best, though there are some foundation blocks to any revision programme that are essential. 'And know what to revise: exam websites are really useful, but do make sure you know the precise course and paper reference codes.' Parents should engage with their children at exam time: Test them on anything they need to learn by rote and make sure they get a healthy breakfast and plenty of weekend exercise . FIND A QUIET PLACE, SWITCH OFF THE INTERNET AND DO PRACTICE QUESTIONS . 'Students need a place to revise, free from distractions and that includes the internet. Though it contains lots of great support material, it can be quite a distraction. 'Revision is not simply re-reading exercise books! It ought to be complemented by undertaking practice questions; challenging oneself is an essential core component of revision too.' Burlington Danes Academy student Fatima Sharif, achieved 4As and 1B grade at AS Level last summer. The student, from White City in West London, currently has conditional offers from five of the country's top universities including Oxford to study English Literature. Although Fatima doesn't have a definite career plan, she is interested in teaching. Here, she explains how she's currently dealing with revising for her A Level exams: . Fatima Sharif is due to sit five A Levels this summer and has a conditional offer from Oxford . 'In order to motivate myself to revise, I think about what I really want to achieve; being really successful, or getting into a great university, and those thoughts really keeps me going. 'I set myself a goal, and my continual motivation is achieving that goal, because I know that it will all be worth it if I just put effort into it now. 'Personally, I don’t really benefit from timetables as I fear that if I am not strictly adhering to them, I am somehow not effectively revising. 'But I definitely recognise that timetables can be incredibly helpful for students as they give them a set time to work and rest, and they break down the huge amounts of work they have into effective revision time. I would definitely recommend a revision timetable to students.' 'Although my family hasn't offered me treats if I do well, I have promised myself them! During my AS exams I really wanted a Kindle, so I told myself that as soon as I got through the tough exams I’d treat myself to one. 'I think revision has more significance if you promise yourself something. It doesn’t have to be big, just something small to direct you on the right course. FATIMA'S TOP THREE TIPS FOR SUCCESSFUL REVISION . USE REVISION AIDS INCLUDING FLASHCARDS, POST-IT NOTES AND HIGHLIGHTERS . 'Ensure your child has the tools they need to revise and keep in close contact with the school to find out what they advise you can do to help your child. 'At Ark Burlington Danes, we hand out revision booklets (that contain the basic knowledge for all subjects), flashcards, highlighters and post-it notes. 'We also send text messages, hold intervention classes, cram timetables and do mock exams and questions.' DON'T BE AFRAID TO TRY NEW TECHNIQUES . ‘"Spaced Learning" has worked well for us: it’s a ‘cramming’ technique based on neuro-scientific research, which enables the memory process to take place very quickly – quickly enough to cover and retain a whole subject module’s content in approximately an hour. 'A Spaced Learning session consists of three identical ‘inputs’ on PowerPoint slides divided by 10-minute breaks filled with ‘brain gym’ activities. 'Watching a whole year group learn, say, about theories on the existence of God and then stand up to write their names in the air backwards with their non writing hand is hilarious!' Don't despair! A positive attitude is essential for both parents and students . FOR STUDENTS . Draw up a revision timetable and stick to it . Revise in a quiet place, free from distractions (switch off the internet if you need to) Use practice questions to hone technique . Buy flashcards, post-it notes and highlighters! Try cram techniques such as 'Spaced Learning' which can train the brain into retaining information . FOR PARENTS . Get involved! Put your child's revision timetable on the fridge at home . Don't bribe your child: the best prize they can have is education . Ask your offspring to explain their work to you; it'll help them to understand it more fully . Offer to test them on the things that they need to learn by rote . Ensure they breakfast well and exercise together on the weekends . Be positive! HOW CAN PARENTS HELP WITH REVISION? 'Parents play a crucial part. 'Firstly, take a close interest in your child's learning, preferably always but especially at exam time. 'Ask your child to explain difficult concepts as teaching someone else is the best way to learn yourself. Test them on anything they need to learn by rote. 'Be positive: high expectations matter and you cannot get away from the fact that exams are a stressful time. 'All a parent can do is to help their child have the very best chance of success and provide every opportunity for their child to give it their best shot.' MAKE SURE THEY EAT WELL AND EXERCISE . 'Feed your child properly throughout the exam season; a good breakfast helps and ensure they get a proper night's sleep too. 'At ArkBDA we provide a healthy breakfast for all pupils and we've found that it really boosts levels of engagement. 'Know when their exams are, set your alarm clock and get up with them to help them get organised. 'At weekends, get some exercise together.' SHOULD YOU PAY FOR EXTRA TUITION? It ought not be necessary in good or better schools, but a tutor can help boost the confidence of a child. I would hope the parents at my school would talk with me first before investing money to support their child. An outstanding school would see this as a failure on their part. BRIBES AREN'T THE ANSWER! A good education is a reward in itself, it opens so many doors. Bribes aren't necessary.
The nation has yet to hear the first words of Prince George. But thanks to new puppet show Newzoids, we can at least get a version of them. In true satirical style, the 20-month-old has been cast as a blinged-up rascal with a tattoo on his arm. Teasers for the ITV programme – which starts tonight at 9pm – show the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge worrying that their son has turned out a little, well, common. Scroll down for video . 'Rascal': A new satire puppet show sees Prince George 'blinged-up' with a tattoo, addressing a female doctor with 'Oi, oi! Hello treacle' A doctor is called to assess his condition and the young prince bounces on screen with a big, gold ‘G’ pendant around his neck. The youngster says to the waiting female doctor ‘Oi, oi! Hello treacle. Is that a ladder in your tights or a stairway to heaven?’ before proceeding to smack her on the bottom. The plotline plays off newspaper headlines which dubbed his mother Kate the Commoner. Debra Stephenson, one of the show’s impressionists, admitted that mocking the royal family is a daunting task. ‘It feels extremely mischievous doing all those voices but it is done for fun. I don't know how it would be received. It's a very daunting thought,’ she told the Daily Mail. Teasers for ITVs new puppet show sees the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge worrying that their son has turned out a little 'common' 'Daunting task': Newzoids starts Wednesday at 9pm and kicks off by making fun of the Royal Family . Big brother: Prince George could be days away of becoming an older brother as the Duchess is due to give birth to her second child 'mid- to late April' ‘You try and pass it off and think “Oh, they won’t possibly watch it” but there is always the worry that someone will be shown a clip on YouTube or something.’ Of the Prince George skit, she said: ‘I like it because it is so surreal. The papers have dubbed Kate 'Kate the Commoner' but she is clearly not common in any way. 'But the idea is quite funny, the idea she could have this throwback gene to something like this.’ Another of the show’s impressionists, Jon Culshaw, best known for Dead Ringers, added: ‘It was an idea that chimed with the writers to have Prince George as a bit of a rascal who runs around saying “Oi, oi!”. It’s an absurd and funny extreme.’ Prince George and his parents will be joined on screen by the Queen, Prince Harry and the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall in a series of sketches titled Mrs Crown’s Boys. Other famous faces on the Newzoids roll call are Ant and Dec, Wayne Rooney, Beyonce, Harry Styles, David Cameron, Ed Miliband, Nick Clegg, Barack Obama, Russell Brand and Simon Cowell.
When high-energy electrons and ions from the sun hit Earth’s upper atmosphere, they can excite atoms and create fantastic colours - which we see on the ground as auroras. And now a study has claimed that we could create our own auroras, by firing a particle accelerator into the sky from space. The intriguing research says that a beam fired from the machine would create artificial auroras  – and it could even create lightning in the atmosphere. Scientists in California have described how to create artificial auroras on Earth. They said a particle accelerator could be sent 185 miles (300km) up into space (illustration of a satellite in orbit shown). It would then fire high-energy beams back at Earth's atmosphere . The study, published in the Journal of Geophysical Research, was picked up by Mark Zastrow from Eos. The accelerator being proposed would be three times stronger than anything like it before, producing a beam with particles 0.5 to 10 million electron volts. Pulses of the beam would last just 0.1 microseconds. The accelerator would be located in space, 185 miles (300km) above the ground, and would fire back towards Earth's atmosphere. There are two types of auroras on Earth - the Aurora Borealis in the Northern Hemisphere, known as the Northern Lights, and the Aurora Australis in the Southern Hemisphere, known as the Southern Lights. Auroras occur when highly charged electrons from the solar wind collide with atoms of oxygen and nitrogen in the earth's atmosphere at altitudes from 20 to 200 miles (32 to 320km) above the planet’s surface. The interactions between the charged particles give off light. Auroral displays appear in many colours: red, yellow, green, blue, and violet. The color of the aurora depends on which atom is struck, and the altitude of the meeting. The common green hue is caused by colliding oxygen molecules at altitudes of up to 150 miles (240km). It would be based on a instrument called the Compact Particle Accelerator for Space Science (Compass), which is being developed by the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and SRI International, both in California. ‘The authors say that employing such instrumentation would offer many scientific opportunities to study the behaviour of particles in the upper atmosphere,’ wrote Mr Zastrow. ‘The paths of the electrons would trace out the arcing field lines of Earth’s magnetic field, illustrating how they bend and snap during the intense geomagnetic activity caused by solar storms. ‘As they descend into the Earth’s atmosphere, some of the electrons would strike atmospheric molecules, producing visible aurora-like emission.’ He added that the beam might even be able to trigger different forms of lightning, including red sprites and blue jets. For now the idea is only a concept, and there are no concrete plans to build it. But the team says that by proving it works, it could be a step towards actually making it. There are two types of auroras on Earth - the Aurora Borealis in the Northern Hemisphere, known as the Northern Lights, and the Aurora Australis in the Southern Hemisphere, known as the Southern Lights. Shown is the Aurora Borealis above the Snaefellsnes Peninsula in Iceland . It would not be the first experiment with Earth’s atmosphere, though. In Alaska there is an ionospheric research programmed called the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program (Haarp). Haarp is jointly funded by the US Air Force, the US Navy, the University of Alaska, and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa). It was established to analyse the ionosphere - a region of the upper atmosphere - and investigate the development of ionospheric enhancement technology for radio communications and surveillance. In Alaska there is already an ionospheric research programmed called the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program (Haarp), pictured. It was established to analyse the ionosphere - a region of the upper atmosphere - and investigate the development of ionospheric enhancement technology . The station regularly uses a tool called the Ionospheric Research Instrument (IRI), a high-power radio frequency transmitter facility operating in the high frequency band. It is used to temporarily excite a limited area of the Ionosphere. Haarp has been the subject of numerous unfounded conspiracy theories. It has been blamed for hurricanes, thunderstorms, major power outages and more, but no convincing evidence supports any of the claims.
A mother whose son suffered severe brain damage during birth is set to receive potentially the biggest medical negligence payout in history. The High Court ruled today that United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust must pay in excess of £14.6 million  for birth injuries, after failing to carry out a Caesarean section on Suzanne Adams and properly monitor her during labour. The hospital's negligence led to her son James Robshaw, now 12, being born with cerebral palsy. The decision, believed to be one of the most significant in a case of medical negligence and the largest ever such court-ordered award for birth injury, reflects the lifetime care that James needs. Suzanne Adams' son James Robshaw was born with cerebral palsy after she hospital staff failed to carry out a Caesarean section or properly monitor her during labour . James cannot speak, dress or feed himself (without assistance of a machine) and must use a wheelchair. His intellect has remained fairly well intact and he communicates through sophisticated eye-gaze equipment. He will however be dependent on others to enable him to carry out the most routine daily tasks for the rest of his life. While the exact sum has yet to be confirmed, MailOnline understands the minimum payout  will be £14.6m. To date, the biggest medical negligence payout has been around £15 million - and Ms Adam's lawyers hope to exceed this amount. Ms Adams was in  labour when she was admitted to Lincoln County hospital in 2002. Although her baby's heart was monitored after her arrival, midwives either ignored or could not interpret the CTG trace - which detects foetal heart rate - correctly. James had an abnormal heart rate and was evidently in some distress and Mrs Adams was exhausted by a prolonged labour. Today, the High Court ruled that United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust must pay Ms Adams in excess of £14.6 million for birth injuries - the largest ever court-ordered award for birth injury . James, now 12, cannot speak, dress or feed himself and must use a wheelchair. He will be dependent on others to enable him to carry out the most routine daily tasks for the rest of his life . The confusion about CTG interpretation and the additional failure to carry out a timely Caesarean section meant there was a delay in delivering James. Resuscitation procedures were then carried out in the delivery room before he was transferred to the Special Care Baby Unit. The sum ordered by the High Court includes money to pay for all James’ needs including: . * 24 hour care provided by a team of live-in carers. * Significant modifications to his home to allow James to use his powered wheelchair and access bathroom, kitchen etc. * Hoisting and tracking equipment to lift James in and out of wheelchairs/bed. * Disability equipment. * Therapists including physiotherapist, speech & language therapist, occupational therapist, AAC therapist, orthotist, orthoptist, psychologist. * Adapted vehicle to enable James to travel in his wheelchair. * Sophisticated eye-gaze equipment to enable James to speak and communicate with people and carry out his school work. * Funding for James’ additional educational needs. Ms Adams' lawyer, Denise Stephens, a partner with law firm Access Legal, argued that had the Caesarean section had been carried out - or hospital staff had monitored the baby’s heart rate properly - the midwife could have identified that James was in distress. In either event, he would have been delivered much sooner and so would not have suffered any injury. Ms Stephens said: ‘This is a tragic case of an avoidable accident at birth which caused devastating injuries. 'James is a bright 12 year old lad with a wicked sense of humour and perhaps the most distressing aspect of this case is the loss of the life James could have had if he had not been injured.’ The United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust finally admitted liability for James’s injuries in 2009 - seven years after his birth. However it took a further six years to fight for damages for James. Speaking today, Ms Adams said: ‘The family has been through a very difficult time. '[The situation] has taken its toll on family relationships and my mental health and I am still on medication for depression and anxiety. 'It was difficult to cope on my own at first and the interim payments my solicitor obtained transformed our lives. 'The award will help James realise his potential. 'But no amount of money can ever make up for the mistakes that have condemned my amazing son to a lifetime of dependency on others.' Pauleen Pratt, acting chief nurse at United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust, said: 'The Trust and the NHS Litigation Authority are deeply sorry for what happened and for the impact this has had upon James and his family. 'The Trust accepted, in 2009, liability for the injuries which James sustained during his birth some 12 years ago. 'Although we cannot turn back the clock, we hope that the compensation, once agreed, will provide the reassurance that James’ future care needs will be met.'
First impressions are not necessarily the best. When Adam Lyth scratched around for 22 in a Championship match against Nottinghamshire in 2008, Graeme Swann branded him a ‘walking wicket’. ‘But then,’ Swann added. ‘He proved us all wrong.’ Lyth, one of six Yorkshire players in the England squad that left Heathrow on Thursday for three Tests in the Caribbean, hit back in that match seven years ago with a second-innings of 132. Wisden later called him ‘the find of the season’. Yorkshire's Adam Lyth fields during day three of the Champion County match against the MCC . Now he finds himself competing with Jonathan Trott to be Alastair Cook’s opening partner at the first Test in Antigua on April 13. It has been quite a rise. ‘I was over the moon when I was told about my selection,’ he told Sportsmail. ‘I can’t wait to get going.’ The story of Lyth’s ascent, from a talented but inconsistent left-hander to the ballast behind Yorkshire’s charge to the Championship last season is one of grit, nous and no little skill. He finished with 1,489 runs — more than anyone in the country — six hundreds and a welter of awards. In fact, much of the hard work had been done before the season began, prompted by a moderate 2013 which forced him to work on his concentration levels. Yorkshire’s sports psychologist Scott Hartley came up with the idea of harnessing Lyth’s love of golf — his handicap is eight — to get him holing one short putt after another. The challenge lay not in the task itself, but in its repetition. ‘There’s no skill in sinking a two-foot putt,’ said Lyth. ‘It’s just about concentration. It’s a bit like batting and not giving your wicket away. You try not to do something silly.’ After 213 successful putts, he missed. But the point had been made. Lyth set about 2014 with renewed focus. ‘It wasn’t just the concentration side of the game — my confidence changed, too,’ he said. ‘I got runs early on against the university sides, then played well at Taunton. It just snowballed from there.’ Lyth plays a shot while batting for Yorkshire against the MCC at the Sheik Zayed Stadium last month . At a time when England’s Test batsmen have lost the knack of scoring the ‘daddy hundreds’ once espoused by former batting coach Graham Gooch, Lyth’s remorselessness caught the selectors’ eye. He made 230 at Northampton, putting on 375 for the first wicket with the highly rated Alex Lees, then 251 against Lancashire at Old Trafford, one short of Darren Lehmann’s Roses record. ‘One of my things is that I’ve never got enough runs,’ said Lyth. ‘If you’re going to get a hundred, you may as well make it a big one.’ Lyth’s dedication has been evident for years. His mum Christine would drive him from game to game in his teenage years, and he spent two seasons trialling as a midfielder with Manchester City before deciding to throw in his lot with cricket (his brother Ashley played for Leicester and Scarborough). And his reluctance to talk about his footballing days tells of a man who wants to be judged by his run-making alone. When he phoned his mum to tell her about his selection, she was ‘very emotional’. Lyth bowls during day three of the Champion County match against the MCC . As the home summer got under way with six university fixtures across the country, it was easy to forget that the first-class season actually began late last month in the Middle East. And, in the now annual fixture in Abu Dhabi between MCC and the champion county, Lyth made 113 and 46 not out as Yorkshire won by nine wickets. Watching on was Cook, who will have a big say in whether he walks out to bat in Antigua with Lyth or Trott, ready to play again after leaving the Ashes tour in November 2013 because of a stress-related condition. Lyth is suitably complimentary about a player with 49 Test caps to his name and an average pushing 47. ‘He deserves his recall. He had a fantastic summer with Warwickshire and showed his class in South Africa with the Lions. ‘It’ll be very hard to keep the likes of him out of the side. I’ve just got to concentrate on myself and impress in the nets.’ The putting green may get a visit, too. Lyth is congratulated by team-mate Alex Lees (right) after taking the wicket of Michael Carberry .
They have become one of the most irritating accessories carried by tourists in recent years, but it appears the selfie stick has been a nuisance for three decades. Hiroshi Ueda, a photographer who worked as an engineer for camera company Minolta, claims that he first invented the selfie stick in the 1980s. He said he came up with the idea after struggling to get pictures of himself and his wife together while they were in Europe. Scroll down for video . Hiroshi Ueda, holding his extender stick for taking 'selfies' which he patented in 1983 while working for Minolta . After having his camera stolen by a child he asked to take their picture in the Louvre Museum in Paris, he dreamed up a solution - an extendable stick with a tripod screw at the end. The 'extender stick', as he called it, was designed for use with new compact cameras that were being developed at the time. Whether taking in a spectacular panorama, visiting a famous landmark or watching a concert; the chances are your view has been ruined by  a selfie stick on at least one occasion. Now the situation may be about to get a whole lot worse, because there’s a next-generation stick that can grasp a tablet as well as a mobile phone. The contraption lets selfie addicts take photos  of themselves using their iPad, ensuring they can capture the best possible duck pout or cheesy grin in their shots. The supersized stick is available on the website Accessory Geeks for just $23 (£16), suggesting that they could be coming to a street near you soon. He added a mirror to the front of the camera so that photographers could see exactly what they were doing. Despite being patented in 1983, the extender stick failed to become a success - mainly due to the poor image quality it captured. But that did not stop Mr Ueda from compiling a family album of family 'selfies' using his device. Speaking to the BBC, he said: 'The idea of taking a picture of yourself was very new back then. 'The philosophy behind it was that I didn't need to rely on anyone else to take a photo - I could take a picture of myself whenever and wherever I liked.' Some 30 years later selfie sticks are now hugely popular - used by narcissists and celebrities everywhere to capture images of themselves in their surroundings. They have become such a menace that many tourist venues, museums, concert venues and stadiums have banned them. Perhaps ironically, Apple - the company that could be blamed for kickstarting the selfie phenomenon by putting a camera on the front of its phones in the first place - has also banned them from its next conference. Mr Ueda used his 'extender stick' to take pictures of himself with his family while on holiday in Europe (above) Modern versions of the extender stick allow a smartphone to be held aloft and use a remote trigger to take the photograph or video. Mr Ueda's patent ran out in 2003, however, so he has not benefited from the recent boom. Instead Canadian inventor Wayne Fromm developed a hand-held extendable selfie stick in the early 2000s, which he called the Quik Pod. While his product has sold well, there are many others available. Mr Ueda said: 'My idea came too early, but that's just one of those things. 'I patented about 300 ideas, so that was just one of them. We call it a 3am invention - it arrived too early.' The idea of selfies, however, is not new. Remote timers and triggers have been available on cameras for decades. A recently unearthed photograph also showed that some early photographers adopted unusual methods to take their own photo - such as using a broom handle to hit the trigger on their camera. Michael Pritchard, Director-General of The Royal Photographic Society, said there is evidence of selfies going back as far as the 1840s. Selfie sticks divide opinion - some people love them and others hate them. But a growing number of venues and attractions have deemed them such a nuisance that they are banning their use. Last month the National Gallery in London became the latest major museum to instruct visitors that the devices were not welcome. It follows bans in galleries in France and America – including the Palace of Versailles and the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Organisers of two major US festivals have also made clear what they think of selfie sticks. The Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival and Lollapalooza are the latest in a string of concert venues and historic landmarks to ban the use of the controversial tech gadgets on their grounds. According to NME , London's O2 Arena and Wembley Arena have also prohibited them, while Rome's Colosseum also do not permit the use of the gadgets.

Sexting is 'not advised for politicians', says Ed Miliband - and 'risky if you are young, dodgy if you are older' in the words of Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg. Both men were asked their opinion on the practice of sending sexy text messages in a quiz for fashion magazine Cosmopolitan's website. Green Party leader Natalie Bennett responded that it is 'OK for other adults but not for me'. And Education Secretary Nicky Morgan answered: 'A bit too risky, thank you very much!' The verdict: Politicians should not sext, says Ed Miliband (right) and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg (left) says it is 'risky' for youngsters and 'dodgy' if you are older . Their responses are hardly surprisingly considering the downfalls of fellow politicians when salacious messages are revealed in the press - including those sent by former MP Brooks Newmark and Tory official Iain Corby. The quiz, which was answered by hand, included a question on the worst thing about politics, which Mr Miliband said was Prime Minister's Questions - 'a bad advert for all of us'. Ms Bennett ticked 'not being able to make the changes you want to', while Ms Morgan opted for people thinking she is boring. Mr Clegg wrote: 'Sitting through 30 minutes of Cameron and Miliband yelling persistently at each other every Wednesday!' The four were also asked about what they would be if not politicians. Green Party leader Natalie Bennett responded that sexting is 'OK for other adults but not for me' Mr Clegg said a wildlife film-maker, while the Labour leader wrote: 'Trying to change the world somehow.' Ms Bennett said she would be an author and Ms Morgan a solicitor. Asked to describe their favourite hangover cure, Mr Miliband said: 'Drinking lots of water but it's been a long time since I had one...' Mr Clegg said: 'Three young boys running around usually does the trick.' Ms Morgan chose a bacon sandwich, while Ms Bennett responded: 'Home-baked gluten-free bread with butter and honey.' In another question, the politicians had to reveal the most hurtful thing they had read about themselves. The Labour leader offered: 'Where do I start?!' and Ms Bennett said a claim that she was trying to be cool, something she says she gave up at the age of 16. The Deputy Prime Minister replied: 'Not hurtful, just absurd - that I have a personal chef! Of course I don't.' Ms Morgan said it was generally people making assumptions about her motives when they have never met her. Another question asked what would be worse than joining the opposition. Mr Clegg said joining Ukip, while Ms Morgan said she would rather join the opposition than do a bungee jump. Ms Bennett and Mr Miliband responded 'none of the above' and 'no way' respectively. It's not difficult to see why the leaders believe politicians should steer clear of sexting as they have plenty of cautionary tales to learn from. Tory MP Brooks Newmark is standing down in May's election after becoming embroiled in a humiliating sexting scandal last year. It was revealed the Conservative member  bombarded a single mother with up to 40 naked pictures and told her 'I am desperate for sex with you'. The father-of-five was forced to issue a grovelling apology after being caught texting explicit photographs of himself for a second time. He had already left his post as minister for civil society after he was exposed as having exchanged photographs with a male journalist posing as a glamorous young Tory PR woman. Tory MP Brooks Newmark is standing down this year after becoming embroiled in two sexting scandals . In April last year, details of salacious messages sent by top Tory official Iain Corby on a gay dating service were revealed. These referred to a sex party for Tory researchers at the party’s annual conference in Manchester, funded by Conservative MPs’ expenses. The Mail on Sunday revealed that the exchanges involved Mr Corby and were one of the reasons he suddenly quit as head of the Westminster-based Parliamentary Resources Unit (PRU), which is paid for by MPs via taxpayer-funded expenses. Disgraced Co-op boss Paul Flowers was suspended from his position after he was filmed buying hard drugs including crystal meth and crack cocaine. The Mail on Sunday revealed exchanges involving Tory official Iain Corby on gay dating service Grindr . The former Labour councillor was further shamed when a teenage rent boy revealed sexually explicit text messages exchanged between them - and revealed he had been asked to accompany Flowers to the summer party of Labour peer Baroness Thornton. And sexting has also caused problems for politicians across the pond. American politician Anthony Weiner, a former representative of the United States House of Representatives, is better known for his two sexting scandals. The first, in 2011, led to his resignation as a Congressman after he sent an intimate picture to a woman over Twitter. And then as he attempted to make a return to politics by running for mayor of New York in 2013, he was forced to admit to sexting three women after pictures were published.
A retired British soldier has been arrested by detectives investigating the shooting of a man with learning difficulties in Northern Ireland in 1974. John Pat Cunningham, 27, was shot by the Army in a field in Benburb, County Armagh. A 73-year-old suspect has now been detained in England. He is being taken to Northern Ireland for questioning at the police's Serious Crime Suite in Antrim. John Pat Cunningham (pictured, left, in photo held by his nephew Charlie Agnew, right) was shot by the British Army in a field in 1974. A man has now been arrested over his death . The case was recently re-opened by the Police Service of Northern Ireland and a murder investigation started following a re-examination of the available evidence. Mr Cunningham had a fear of men in uniform and was running away from an Army patrol when he was shot. The Government apologised for his death in 2013. The inquiry is being carried out by the PSNI's Legacy Investigations Branch - a unit which examines historic cases from the Troubles. Relatives of Mr Cunningham, who had a mental age of between six and 10, said the investigation did not have their support. Mr Cunningham was running away from an Army patrol when he was shot. He had a fear of men in uniform . Victims campaign organisation the Pat Finucane Centre (PFC) issued a statement on the family's behalf. 'Whilst family members have cautiously welcomed the arrest, they have asked the PFC to state categorically that they will only have confidence in an investigative process that is completely independent of the PSNI,' said a PFC spokesman. 'Cunningham family members said in October 2013 that they wish to see all investigations into British Army killings, including that of John Pat, being investigated by an independent body.' The investigation into the shooting was re-opened in March this year. Speaking in March, DI Neil McGuinness of the PSNI said: 'I appreciate this happened more than 40 years ago but I believe there are people in the community today who remember this tragic incident, who knew John Pat and who may have information which would be of assistance to the investigation. 'Our objective is to get to the truth of what happened that Saturday morning so that justice can be served.' The Government apologised for his death in 2013. A police investigation was re-opened earlier this year . Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.
Arsenal are only three signings away from winning the title and should start by pinching Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech, according to former Gunners midfielder Ray Parlour. Cech is likely to be watching from the substitutes bench when Arsenal face Chelsea at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday, having made only four league starts this season. Jose Mourinho's men are 10 points clear going into the game this weekend but Parlour believes signing Cech in the summer can help Arsenal overcome the Blues next year. Ray Parlour believes Arsenal moving for Petr Cech this summer would be a 'no brainer' The experienced keepers has made just four league starts this season for the Blues . 'Cech would definitely be on my radar if I was Arsene Wenger,' said Parlour, who was speaking at the Boot Camp stage of The People's Pundit, championed by Carlsberg - the Official Beer of the England team and the Premier League. 'Cech has got that experience, he's played in big games and he's only 33 so he's got plenty of years left in him. 'Wojciech Szczesny wants to play on a regular basis and you could still get good money for him, someone will buy him for around £6million. 'So it's a no-brainer really. If you can get Cech for around £10m and sell Szcezsny for £6m, it's a great deal for Arsenal. 'The question is will Chelsea sell to a rival? I'm not sure they will.' Arsenal can make it nine consecutive league victories with a win on Sunday and the team's strong finish to the campaign has given Gunners fans hope for a more sustained title challenge next year. 'The summer window will be very important to what happens next season,' Parlour said. Cech (left) has had to play second fiddle to Thibaut Courtois (right) all season . 'The spine of the team needs strengthening - I think they need a centre half, a central midfielder and a goalkeeper. 'Alexis Sanchez has had a brilliant season, he's set the bar so high so early in his career that when he dropped off, it seemed like it wasn't the Sanchez we know. 'He has been amazing this season. If Arsene Wenger can get two or three players of his calibre this summer, there's no reason why Arsenal can't win the league next year.' Wenger has not come out on top against Mourinho in 12 attempts and a win this weekend would be particularly welcome for the Frenchman as Arsenal look to cement second place. Chelsea ground out a 1-0 victory against Manchester United last time out and Parlour expects the league leaders to be resolute again on Sunday. Parlour believes the Gunners should sell Wojciech Szczesny in order to sign Cech this summer . 'A draw is a perfect result for Chelsea,' Parlour said. 'They'll look to defend well and put in a solid performance so it's up to Arsenal to ask questions. 'With the pace they've got, Arsenal can test Chelsea's back four. 'John Terry has been brilliant this year but he does sit off a bit deeper now to allow for his lack of pace and that might give more space in midfield. 'Arsene will look at getting Sanchez into those spaces and perhaps Theo Walcott will start as well. 'It's a big, big game for Arsenal. Chelsea will win the league but there's still a battle for second, third and fourth so it's a bigger game for Arsenal than it is for Chelsea.' :: The People's Pundit has narrowed down its search to five football fans in with a chance of winning their big break on talkSPORT on the last day of the Barclays Premier League season.

A senior high school teacher from Anshun city has been dubbed the 'luckiest wife in China' after her soldier husband cooked her enough food to last for a year before he returned to service. The woman, named only as Ms Zhao, lives in a house bursting with frozen dishes and snacks. Husband Yin Yunfeng spent the last week of his annual holiday making all sorts of stir-fried dishes as well as about 1,000 dumplings as a way to show his love to his wife, according to thePeople's Daily Online. Treasure chest: Ms Zhao has enough food to last for a year prepared by her husband . Feast: The husband, Yin Yunfeng, spent a week cooking all sorts of stir-fried dishes . All-you-can-eat: He also made about 1,000 dumplings before returning to his regiment in Tibet . The devoted husband is worried that his wife would be eating instant noodles all the time so he cooked different types of dishes and put them into small foam containers to be frozen. Ms Shao said she is extremely busy with work and only has fresh meals when her husband is home. But now all she needs to do is to reheat the food in the microwave. Mr Yin is stationed in a regiment in Tibet and only gets to go home - which is some 2,700 kilometres away in southern China - once a year. 'Although I mentally prepared myself for this life when I married him, I had no idea it would be so tough,' sais Ms Zhao. 'At the end of every holiday I would be devastated and would cry all day but I will continue to support him in his career and look after this family.' She added: 'The food he prepared is enough for me for one year and every time I think of this my heart is warm.' In addition to meals, Mr Yin has also bought a large amount of snacks and hid them in different corners of the house as daily surprises to his wife. Well-arranged: The husband also separated all dishes into small foam containers to be frozen . Secret: Mr Yin has also bought a large amount of snacks and hid them in different corners of the house . Note of love: Yin left his wife a note saying he hoped he would be home when she finishes the food and snacks . Every day, he texts her the clues to find these snacks. 'Today you have been studying very hard and I have a reward for you. Behind the sofa on the right there is a gap and I have left you a packet of raisins,' reads one of the messages. The snacks include chips, pumpkin seeds, chewing gum, biscuits, beef jerky and instant noodles. Yin said he hoped he would be home by the time his wife finishes the food and snacks.
The father branded a 'pikey' during a neighbourhood row over Christmas lights will defiantly switch them on tonight. Kevin Franklin, of Dunstable, Bedfordshire, says he will switch his lights on every evening in April for Autism Awareness Month. Mr Franklin's 15-year-old son Bradley is autistic and the family want to use his Christmas light show to raise awareness for charities working with those with the disability. Kevin Franklin will light up his Christmas lights on the front of his home tonight for Autism Awareness Month . The 53-year-old father put the lights up on his council house last November in preparation for Christmas. But he didn't take them down in January because he wanted to switch the lights on again in April for Autism Awareness Month. The continued presence of the lights in recent weeks has angered some neighbours, prompting a poison pen letter last month. It read: 'I am fed up of seeing your grotesque tacky council house Christmas lights. It is March, for goodness sake. Your house leaves this lovely community looking a disgrace. 'It looks like a state. It sticks out like a sore thumb. I don't want to keep driving past this eyesore, every time I do, my kids scream. I know you live in a council house, but there's no need to make it look like one.' The letter finished 'Yours sincerely, a very disgruntled citizen.' The father kept them up after Christmas ahead of autism week, prompting anger from some neighbours . The continued presence of the light, prompted one local resident to write this abusive message to Mr Franklin . Mr Franklin, who has been medically retired from work after suffering two strokes and a heart attack, said today: 'I will be putting on the lights tonight when it gets dark and switch them off again around 10pm. This will happen throughout April for Autism Awareness Month. 'That was always my plan and it's why, back in January, I decided not to take them down because I knew I would be putting them up again in April. 'I would have taken the lights down after April but now I'm going to leave them on the house out of principle, but I won't be turning them on again until December 2.' The former publican added: 'It's been blown out of all proportion and has turned into a row between council house tenants and those who own their properties. 'Some people think we are scum because we rent, but my house looks a lot tidier than some of those that have been bought by the occupants. 'We are all human beings and the only difference is they have bought their pile of bricks and I rent mine.' He says his nearest neighbours support him in his idea to raise awareness of charities. He added: 'I've even heard some neighbours saying they will donate to charity and I've been told that some people around Dunstable may even put up their own Christmas lights in support.' He said he planned to take them down next month, but now will keep them up 'out of principle'
Paris Saint-Germain manager Laurent Blanc admitted that Barcelona were superior to his side 'in virtually every department' as he saw his team slump to a 3-1 defeat in the first leg of the quarter-final at the Parc des Princes. An early strike from Neymar and second-half brace from Luis Suarez sealed victory for Barcelona and placed the Catalan outfit into a commanding position ahead of the return at the Nou Camp on Tuesday. Blanc admitted his side felt the absence of the suspended Marco Verratti and Zlatan Ibrahimovic, while PSG were also unable to start with David Luiz and saw Thiago Silva hobble off in the early stages. Luis Suarez eases past David Luiz en route to scoring his second goal of the Champions League tie . Gerard Pique leads the celebrations after Barcelona secured a 3-1 victory in Paris on Wednesday night . 'I'm not going to make excuses about us being depleted,' said Blanc. 'I'm not doing that. We put a team out there, but we were dominated by Barcelona. 'It's only six days until the second leg, with a league game in between, so it's a 'short week' for people to recover. I think Barcelona were fitter than us. We had players who weren't at 100 per cent, and also a lot of absentees, but that should have been a motivation for us. We never controlled the ball well enough, and Barca were better than us in virtually every department. 'We will have the suspended players back next week, and that is an incentive. We'll try and put on a better show than we did tonight. They were better than us tonight and scored three goals. We'll try and show a different PSG at Barcelona next week. Hopefully we will achieve a different result.' Laurent Blanc made no excuses for his side as they now face elimination from the Champions League . David Luiz, who started the game from the substitutes' bench, endured a night to forget in the French capital . In the end, the Frenchman was relieved to escape only 3-1 down. 'It didn't end up as bad as it might have done, but the players are very disappointed with the way it went,' he said. 'We gave the impression we gave Barcelona the kind of game they wanted to pay. They made life difficult for us on the counter-attack and have players who can be very dangerous.' Barcelona manager Luis Enrique was delighted with his side's showing and reserved special praise for Suarez. 'Suarez is special in his own way,' Enrique said, 'Look at the goals he scored for Ajax and Liverpool. He is very strong and finishes so well. But it wasn't just about Luis Suarez tonight. We were superb in defence, midfield and attack.'
Drank himself to death: Charles Terreni Jr had a blood alcohol level of .375 when he died . An 18-year-old University of Carolina freshman who was found dead after a St Patrick's Day party died of alcohol poisoning in a 'tragic and totally preventable death', a coroner has ruled. Charles Terreni Jr was four times over the legal alcohol limit when he died, an autopsy has found. He was found at the Pi Kappa Alpha house in Columbia, not far from campus, around 10:30am on March 18, the morning after an alleged 'kegger' at the house for the annual Irish holiday. Terreni's official blood alcohol reading was .375, according to WISTV. He is the son of Columbia attorney Charles Terreni, a former staff member for then-Lt. Gov. Bob Peeler, a former state Public Service Commissioner and a man involved in legislative redistricting. The death is still under investigation. Circumstances leading up to his death are not clear, but the house was draped in St Patrick's decorations and a beer keg could be seen outside. Neither the fraternity nor the university has explained the situation in detail. However, USC suspended the fraternity in the wake of the death. Neighbors said the house threw a party the night before, and noted the leftover keg Wednesday morning. 'I would say there are three houses there, and I don't know who exactly lives in them, but there's always a frequency of parties going on,' neighbor Mehrdad Vejdani told Fox Carolina. 'At times, there can be a hundred people in that place. Live band in the backyard, which is fine. I mean, some noise, but it doesn't bother us too much.' Scroll down for video . Suspended: The Pi Kappa Alpha house at the University of South Carolina has been suspended, after a brother was found dead in a house Wednesday morning . Rager? Neighbors said the house had a party the night before, on St Patrick's Day. On Wednesday, several stray cups and a keg were seen on the porch, as well as clover decorations . The Columbia Police Department and Richland County Coroner's Office have both labeled the death 'suspicious'. Responding the Terreni's death, the fraternity's national office released a statement saying the USC chapter had been placed on leave pending the investigation. It said: 'The fraternity’s thoughts and prayers are with the family of this young man and the brothers of Xi Chapter'. A spokesman for USC added: 'There are a lot of rumors out there about the circumstances surrounding the death but at this point the matter remains under investigation.' 'While we await further information we are focused on helping our community grieve and heal.' This is the second incident at the fraternity in a week. Last Friday, the University of Connecticut chapter lost recognition for hazing members, providing alcohol to underage students and harassing women. Pi Kappa Alpha was founded in 1868 at the University of Virginia and has now grown to include some 220 groups across the U.S. and Canada. The house has been plagued by controversy before. In November 2012, a 19-year-old student at Northern Illinois University died after a night of heavy drinking. Five frat members were charged with felonies for hazing and the chapter was suspended indefinitely. That same year, the University of Tennessee, Knoxville chapter was suspended indefinitely when a 20-year-old member was hospitalized for reportedly ingesting wine through his anus.
As a mother of five children, economist Vicky Pryce might need a helping hand more than your average mum. However, the revelation that she'd rather have a good au pair than a husband is perhaps more of a reflection on her relationship with her own ex husband, disgraced former Lib Dem MP Chris Huhne, than it is a general statement about child-rearing. Greek-born Pryce, who famously spent two months at Her Majesty's pleasure after being convicted of perverting the course of justice for taking Huhne's speeding fines, has been speaking about life post prison and how she's handled a stellar, if not tumultuous, career - all while bringing up her brood. Despite having a high-flying career, Vicky Pryce has managed to raise five children...but admits she would miss them when work commitments came calling . Speaking to the Times, the author, who since her stint behind bars, which ended in May 2013, has written a book about life in women's prisons, says that her advice to women would be to 'be as independent as you possibly can.' The economist is said to now be enjoying the company of former MP and convicted fraudster Denis MacShane but with two failed marriages behind her, it seems that good childcare has been essential to raising her own children. Returning to the workplace within two months with each of her children required her to take a tough 'cry it out' approach with them, she says. Pryce, 62, freely admits that within just weeks of their birth, her offspring were put into their own room and left to cry until they learned to soothe themselves back to sleep. The worst episode saw one of her children scream it for two hours, she says. Something has to give: Pryce, pictured here in 2013 with Professor Noreena Hertz (left) admits she never baked cakes for her children and would often be late for parties . Pryce admits to not knowing the names of her children's friends while they were growing up and that she sacrificed more traditional motherly duties such as cake baking or preparing costumes in favour of her career. Maternal guilt didn't plague her though but she does admit to missing her children dreadfully while absent from them with work commitments. 'For me it is not guilt, it is missing them. That is the issue. If you start feeling guilty you’ve had it really.' After child number five, she admits she returned to work for a meeting within a week of her baby's birth and says she found it surprisingly easy to switch off. She said: 'The interesting thing is that as soon as I got into the cab, I immediately switched my brain to work brain. When you’re here with a baby you don’t actually think you can do it. But you can. And I did.' Romance? Vicky Pryce, pictured arriving at Southwark court for her sentencing in 2013, is said to be 'close' to former MP and convicted fraudster Denis MacShane . No love lost: Pictured with ex-husband Chris Huhne. The couple both served time in prison for perverting the course of justice over speeding fines issued in 2003 . Pryce, who speaks four languages, advocates too an early return to work as a way of battling post-natal depression, saying that 'you can't afford to have the baby blues' if you're charged with holding down a job and a family. After a high-profile career with professional services goliath KPMG, she worked as a government advisor before coming unstuck when she lied to the police about taking her former husband's speeding points. She was jailed in March 2013. Her trial heard she only revealed she had taken them to exact revenge on her cheating husband and 'nail him' after he left her for another woman. Former Energy Secretary Huhne was clocked driving too fast in March 2003 and persuaded Pryce to take the blame so he could avoid losing his licence. The couple separated after 26 years of marriage in 2010 after Mr Huhne admitted he was having an affair with his PR adviser Carina Trimingham, 46. After nearly two years proclaiming his innocence and fighting to have the case dropped, Huhne changed his plea at the start of the pair's trial at Southwark Crown Court, promptly resigning as Liberal Democrat MP for Eastleigh and ending his political career. Ms Pryce – who started her sentence in Holloway, Britain’s toughest women’s jail – was inspired by her experiences to write a book about how and why women end up in prison – and to express her concerns about the way they are treated there. She embraced prison life, taking part in karaoke and playing bingo for the first time, before being released on a tag.
Budget airline easyJet has been charging stranded customers a £10 fee for proof that their flight was cancelled. The charge came to light when customers sought to claim money back from travel insurers after French air-traffic strikes affected flights earlier this month. They were asked to provide an airline letter confirming the cancellation, but easyJet told its hard-hit passengers to pay a £10 fee. Scroll down for video . Compensation: The charge came to light when easyJet customers sought to claim money back from travel insurers after French air-traffic strikes affected flights earlier this month. Above, file image . The Association of European Airlines confirmed last night that no other airline has attempted to charge for this and said customers should not be charged. However, a spokesman for easyJet defended the airline’s position, saying: ‘The administration charge for the letter is applied because each letter has to be individually researched and created for each passenger.’ In an email seen by the Mail in response to one customer’s request, easyJet’s customer service team said: ‘We can certainly send you a letter to help you claim on your insurance, that’s not a problem. ‘There is a small administration fee of 10GBP for the letter, which you should be able to claim back through your insurer.’ There were delays and 1,000 flight cancellations across Europe this month following the 48-hour strike by French air-traffic controllers. EasyJet is France’s second-largest airline and cancelled 588 flights over the two days. The airline launched ‘rescue flights’ to repatriate holidaymakers and children stranded abroad. Ryanair cancelled 500 flights while British Airways and Flybe cancelled fewer than 50 each. Travel chaos: There were delays and 1,000 flight cancellations across Europe this month following the 48-hour strike by French air-traffic controllers. Pictured, passengers queue for check-in at Stansted Airport . And flight cancellations have risen by a fifth in the first quarter of 2015 as services were hit by poor weather as well as the strikes. There were 5,080 cancellations in the first three months of 2015 compared to 4,239 in the same period last year. The number of delayed flights increased by 7 per cent with 2,427 hold-ups compared to 2,260. Monarch had the greatest increase in delays – 30 per cent – with 64 incidents, according to figures from compensation firm EUClaim. Strikes: Ryanair cancelled 500 flights while British Airways and Flybe cancelled fewer than 50 each. Above, a flight information board at Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris, where several flights were cancelled . EasyJet has seen a 19 per cent increase with 245 delays in the first four months of this year compared to 206 last year. The EUClaim report said: ‘There are two main reasons for the poor start to the year. Firstly the winter weather across Europe has been worse than 2014 this particularly affected Jet2, easyJet and Monarch who suffered considerable delays on their routes to Chambery and Grenoble in France. ‘The second cause has been the number of strikes in Europe. The four-day Lufthansa strike resulted in some 116 cancelled flights to the UK, strikes by Italian air traffic controllers and security staff in Germany has also compounded the problem.’
The scene looks as though there has been a disaster. In what was likened to a ‘military operation’ a pair of cranes struggle to retrieve a ‘casualty’ from a house, while fire engines, police, a medical team and other officials stand by. The immediate area is screened from the public gaze with tarpaulin. Roads are cordoned off. No traffic can get to nearby schools. For seven hours, there is a state of ‘mayhem’. Yet it was no sudden catastrophic incident, as some witnesses imagined. This was simply what it took to remove a 22-year-old woman who weighs 55st from her home. Scroll down for video . Obese Georgia Davis, 22, who weighs 55 stone, had to be lifted out of her home in Aberdare, south Wales, by a crane so emergency services could take her to hospital . The seven-hour operation involved two cranes, seven police cars, two fire engines and 11 medics . Georgia Davis is an extreme manifestation of the obesity epidemic afflicting young people in Britain. She is 5ft 6in tall but exists on a 13,000-calorie-a-day binge of takeaways and junk food which has rendered her immobile. The source of her income to finance her intake is unclear. ‘Britain’s fattest woman’, as she has been described, eats to excess because she wants to and has done so since the age of five. Periodically, her bloated body can take it no more and she has to be removed to hospital for treatment. That is what happened in the village of Cwmaman, on the edge of Aberdare, on Wednesday. It is the second time in three years the emergency services have been summoned to free her from her self-inflicted prison. On the first occasion they had to demolish part of her parents’ house. Since then she has been given a specially adapted ground-floor flat with French doors opening onto the street. This was to allow easier access for the next inevitable medical emergency. And so it came to pass. Largely bedridden for the past fortnight because of water retention, Georgia developed a ‘severe infection’ which required hospital treatment. But she had become too big and weak to move. Calling the ambulance meant a major logistical operation which must have cost thousands of pounds in manpower and equipment hire . he first crane proved not strong enough to lift the patient. A larger crane had to be summoned which necessitated closing half-a-mile of the main road for an hour . For other individuals, this would at worst have been a question of calling an ambulance. In Georgia’s extraordinary case it meant a major logistical operation which must have cost thousands of pounds in manpower and equipment hire. Her extraction began a little after 9am. Three nurses from the local hospital and a paramedic arrived outside Georgia’s block of flats in a convoy of cars. They were to prepare her for the move. Soon afterwards, the medical team was joined by a fire officer, whose job it was to assess the dimensions and route of the removal. He decided the special French doors would have to be entirely removed. The first police officers and an ambulance arrived at 10am, according to neighbours. At 11.30am, two fire tenders pulled up followed by a mobile crane, an essential piece of equipment when lifting a 55st woman on a reinforced stretcher. At midday, three police cars arrived. They would be joined in the afternoon by another four. One resident reported: ‘It’s absolute chaos, there’s 999 vehicles everywhere and dozens of emergency service workers. All the roads are shut.’ And still the operation had not begun. At 2.30pm, the critical care medical team arrived in an SUV. By the time the first attempt to remove Georgia began an hour later, there were more than a dozen emergency vehicles outside the flats and in the car park at the back. Soon, a serious problem became apparent. The first crane proved not strong enough to lift the patient. A larger crane had to be summoned which necessitated closing half-a-mile of the main road for an hour. By the time it arrived, eyewitnesses estimated the number of specialists in attendance to be as many as 40. You may wonder why and what else was happening elsewhere in South Wales that might have more usefully held their attention. One neighbour said: ‘I thought the flats were on fire, there were so many vehicles. The road was totally blocked, it was absolute mayhem.’ Largely bedridden for the past fortnight because of water retention, Georgia (pictured left and right) developed a ‘severe infection’ which required hospital treatment. But she had become too big and weak to move . Georgia blamed her initial bingeing on ‘comfort eating’ following the death of her father from emphysema when she was little . Georgia was finally removed seven hours after the procedure began. She was taken in a reinforced ambulance to Royal Glamorgan hospital, where she is expected to remain for weeks. It was claimed that she had recently begun eating salads in order to lose weight. But as one neighbour, Anita Coolney, reportedly pointed out: ‘Georgia may be having salads, but she is having takeaways too. I’ve seen them being delivered. What’s the good of having salad for lunch if you have an 18in pizza for tea?’ Another was reported to have said: ‘I can’t eat as much in a week as she eats in a day. It’s disgusting.’ A spokesman for Cwm Taf University Health Board said: ‘We can confirm that the fire service was brought in to assist us with access to a property in order to safely transport a patient into hospital.’ South Wales Police, South Wales Fire and Rescue Service all refused to comment on the cost of the operation. Social landlord RCT homes, which owns Georgia’s flat, also refused to comment. Her mother Lesley, who has weighed as much as 31st, must also take a good deal of the blame. She had fed baby Georgia condensed milk and potatoes instead of baby food . A spokesman for the Welsh Ambulance Service said: ‘We attended a joint operation with colleagues from Cwm Taf University Health Board, South Wales Fire and Rescue Service, the Emergency Medical Retrieval and Transfer Service, and South Wales Police to assist in the transportation of a patient to hospital. ‘This involved nine personnel from Welsh Ambulance Service and two from EMRTS. The operation started with preparation on site at 9.15am and our staff left the scene at 4pm.’ Georgia first came to national attention in 2008 when, aged 15, she had a 64in waist and weighed 33st. She also had Type 2 diabetes. She said: ‘I know it’s partly my fault. But it’s so hard to stop eating. It’s like a drug. Some people choose heroin but I’ve chosen food and it’s killing me. It’s as if I can hear Greggs [the bakers] calling me.’ She blamed her initial bingeing on ‘comfort eating’ following the death of her father from emphysema when she was little. At seven she weighed 11st. As a teenager her daily intake included multi-packs of crisps, litre bottles of fizzy drinks, chips and sausages. She was banned from her school canteen for over-eating. She had stopped attending PE lessons long before. At home, she watched television, surfed the internet and, of course, ate. And ate. Her mother Lesley, who has weighed as much as 31st, must also take a good deal of the blame. She had fed baby Georgia condensed milk and potatoes instead of baby food. Georgia was sent to a ‘fat camp’ in the U.S. after doctors warned she would die if she didn’t lose 20st. In nine months there she lost 14st 6lb as she took regular exercise and existed on 1,500 calories a day. But she was welcomed home with fish and chips and within 20 months was back up to 40st. Crisis point was reached in 2012, by which time the 19-year-old was eating seven kebabs in one sitting and had reached a weight of 63st. It is the second time in three years the emergency services have been summoned to free her from her self-inflicted prison. She also had to be rescued from her home in 2012 in a similar operation . During that incident, a 40-strong team of emergency service personnel and engineers laboured for eight hours to remove her from her bedroom at the housing association home she shared with her mother and stepfather . A 40-strong team of emergency service personnel and engineers laboured for eight hours to remove her from her bedroom at the housing association home she shared with her mother and stepfather. Georgia had collapsed with breathing problems and chest pains. The rescuers had to demolish the top half of the semi and build a scaffold in order to support a ramp to the pavement. Roof supports had to be inserted and she was lifted onto a special stretcher using a crane. Again a reinforced ambulance took her to hospital. The operation, including repairs, was costed at £100,000. Such scenes will be repeated if more is not done to tackle obesity, say campaigners. One in three children in the UK is overweight, while one in five is obese. Teenage girls form the majority of the one million or so obese under-18s. National Obesity Forum spokesman Tam Fry said: ‘It is a military operation. It will be an equivalent cost, which the NHS has to pay. ‘There will be many more Georgia Davises who we don’t know about because they are stuck in their houses and cannot get out without being winched out. ‘The NHS has to introduce screening for children and adults and if we don’t do that we are going to find more of this in the future.’ Additional reporting by BEN WILKINSON .
A woman was arrested in China after apparently dumping her newborn baby in a rubbish bin in a fast-food restaurant. Staff heard the baby girl crying in the ladies' toilet of a burger bar in Chengdu, Sichuan province, reports People's Daily Online. Workers who found the baby, who was wrapped in a shirt but was still attached to the umbilical cord and placenta, called the police and ambulance. A baby girl was found in the bin inside the ladies' toilet at a Chinese burger bar . A woman who had been seen visiting the toilet was established to be the mother and was arrested . Staff at the restaurant said they saw the woman going into the toilet and noticed that she'd stayed there for a long time. After she came out, she went back to her seat, sitting there without speaking a word. 'After we discovered the baby girl, we checked the CCTV footage, we found this woman likely to be the mother of the baby, so we called the ambulance as well as the police,' one worker said. The woman, Yuan Yen, 34, was found to have blood on her when she was approached. She refused to look at her baby or talk to police, who discovered her identity by looking through her purse. Workers at the restaurant said Yuan Yen had returned to her table and sat 'in a trance' She was arrested after receiving medical attention and faces charges of neglect . Police insisted she have emergency treatment and took her to the same hospital as her daughter, where she refused to see doctors. A worker at the fast food outlet said: 'The mother was in shock herself and was just sitting there in a trance. 'There was blood all over her shirt and she had her head bowed in shame. I think she was just traumatised.' Cops tried to locate her relatives but were unable to contact anybody as her phone had no credit and she had no local addresses on her. She was later transferred to the police station where she is facing charges of neglect. The infant, weighing 2.6kg (5.7lb), was declared to be healthy after being checked over by doctors.
A man tragically ran over his granddaughter Friday morning as he moved his truck in the driveway. In what is being described as a horrific accident, 20-month-old Kendra Moad of Kearns, Utah followed her grandfather, who has not been named, out of the house as he pulled his truck forward so he could move some garbage cans. He did not however see the toddler in front of his truck and killed her. Scroll down for video . Kendra Moad(above)  of Kearns, Utah followed her grandfather out of the house Friday morning and into the driveway . He did not see the toddler and ran her over as he pulled his truck up in the driveway (above) to move the trash cans and ran over and killed the 20-month-old . 'He got into the red Chevy pickup truck parked at the residence to pull it forward so he could move the garbage cans and unfortunately the child managed to get under, in front of car and he ran over the child,' Unified Police Department Lt. Justin Hoyal told Fox 13. 'Very tragic situation here today.' Kendra suffered severe head trauma and was unconscious when medical workers arrived, and was pronounced dead shortly after at a nearby hospital. This is now the fourth time since August that a child was accidentally run over and killed in their own driveway by a family member in Utah. The grandfather is not facing any charges at this time, but the case remains under investigation. 'No family member ever wants to go through something like this, and so it’s always important that when you are pulling out, you’re backing out of your driveway: Just take that extra second to check and make sure there is nobody, none of the children have followed you out, or nobody is around your vehicle,' said Hoyal.
Jeremy Clarkson and his fellow Top Gear presenters were just about to renew their lucrative contacts for three more years but they were scrapped when the star punched the show's producer. James May, 52, revealed he had prematurely celebrated the three-year deal by ordering a rare  £200,000 Ferrari before Clarkson's sacking after an infamous 'fracas' with producer Oisin Tymon. May says he had ordered the last ever Ferrari 458 Speciale - in bright orange - while the 'draft version' of the lucrative contract was sitting on his desk 'with only a few details to resolve'. But after Clarkson punched Tymon in a rage over a hot meal, the offer was taken off the table. Scroll down for video . Jeremy Clarkson (right) and his Top Gear colleagues had been on the brink of a lucrative new contract when Clarkson's infamous 'fracas' led to the offer being taken away . May revealed that he had prematurely celebrated the three-year deal while the contract was still being finalised by ordering a £200,000 Ferrari 458 Speciale in bright orange (pictured) The presenter said the trio had planned to continue making the show until the end of the new contract before leaving 'with dignity'. But Clarkson, 55, was sensationally sacked by the BBC last month and Richard Hammond, 45, joined May in confirming he will not return to Top Gear this week. Writing in a column for the Sunday Times, May said: 'There we were, all three of us, on the brink of a new three-year contract to make Top Gear, after which we would definitely chuck it in with dignity and hand the reins to a new generation, assuming we were still alive . 'There were a few details to resolve about time frames and other mundane stuff, but the groaning draft version of this document was actually sitting on my desk. 'This was a great privilege and a once-in-a-lifetime event; an invitation to continue presenting the world's biggest TV show for – let's not be shy – a handsome salary.' The three men had planned to stay on for another three years before quitting 'with dignity' until Clarkson was sensationally sacked after punching show producer Oisin Tymon (pictured) On the future, he remained vague, suggested the three may be reunited on screen or go in separate directions. Now, May admits ordering a brand new Ferrari is a 'strange' thing for an unemployed person to do, but insists he has no regrets, describing the purchase as a once-in-lifetime opportunity. He acknowledged the supercar was an extravagant purchase at £208,090 but that 'it was better than money in the bank'. Meanwhile, Clarkson was seen talking himself out of a parking ticket for his bright green Lamborghini yesterday after leaving it parked on yellow lines in London. Elsewhere, Hammond told reporters at a charity bike rally that the future will be 'exciting' for the three men, but refused to speculate further on the future of Top Gear. He said: 'Everybody knows what's happened. That's all been in the news. The future, nobody knows yet do they? 'And I cannot and won't speculate further than that. So don't know, let's see. It'll be exciting whatever.' There is mounting speculation the men are working on a new motoring series to be aired by Netflix, Amazon or another British broadcaster. Producer Olsin Tymon had his lip split by Clarkson in the March 4 assault and took himself to hospital with his injuries. Police investigated the attack but Tymon told them he did not want to press charges and officers announced earlier this month they would 'not be pursuing the matter any further.' James May (right) was vague on the future for the trio, hinting that they may be reunited on screen .
Blackpool are in talks to sign Austria defender Thomas Piermayr. The 25-year-old has been training with the Championship club this week and they are keen to get him on board for what is expected to be confirmed as a campaign in League One next season. Piermayr is a free agent and had been playing for Colorado Rapids. The former Austria Under-21 international had a spell with Inverness Caledonian Thistle in 2011.

A supporter waits the best part of an hour for five seconds with Ryan Taylor. There is a quick picture and good-luck message ahead of Sunday's Tyne-Wear derby. He is, evidently, one of the few players genuinely respected by Newcastle's disillusioned fans. Taylor scored the winner at the Stadium of Light three seasons ago, affording him a terrace tribute – 'Ryan Taylor, over the wall' – as well as a place in black-and-white folklore. But there is more to the Toon Army's admiration than one free-kick against the enemy. A working-class Scouser who came through the ranks at Tranmere and made 100 appearances by the time he was 21 before beating three career-threatening injuries, Taylor 'gets' the proud principles of the North East – appreciation, hard graft, honesty and enjoyment. He has himself been a fan in the crowd during three of the last four derby defeats - he watched the other from a hotel room in America after undergoing surgery on the second of the cruciate ligament injuries which kept him out for 26 months. Newcastle utility player Ryan Taylor (right) shields the ball from Arsenal forward Danny Welbeck . Taylor scores with a superb free-kick against Sunderland to win the game 1-0 at the Stadium of Light . Taylor is congratulated by Newcastle defender Steven Taylor  in the club's last victory over Sunderland . Newcastle supported him through that long rehabilitation, something for which Taylor will always be grateful. But with his current contract at St James' Park set to expire this summer, the 30-year-old does not know what the future holds. He would like to remain on Tyneside. He accepts, though, that this could be his final taste of the fixture which has guaranteed him lifelong worship. 'I have to be realistic, this could be my last derby,' he told Sportsmail. 'I don't want it to be, but that will be in my mind. So I'm not going to let it go the way of the last four - that cannot carry on. 'I've left the stadium gutted after every one of them and I've felt it like a fan. So we owe it to them now. 'I grew up with Liverpool and Everton, but that isn't as big because you live in the same house a lot of the time. 'So I'll be doing everything I can personally do to make sure we're up for it, because our performances in the last four just haven't been good enough.' Taylor returned after more than two years of painstaking gym sessions alone for October's 2-0 win at Manchester City in the League Cup. He was man-of-the-match and was greeted by a standing ovation in the dressing-room, where text messages from the likes of Steven Gerrard and Michael Owen awaited. Ninety minutes against the champions, however, had taken its toll. In the next game, at home to QPR, St James' was stunned into silence when, after half an hour, a tearful Taylor sat himself on the turf clutching the same ill-fated knee. Taylor's injury record at Newcastle has severely limited his first-team appearances over the past few years . The 30-year-old is incredibly grateful to Newcastle for sticking by him and hopes to repay them on Sunday . 'I thought to myself, 'Why me?',' he reflects. 'You start doubting whether the knee will ever be strong enough. I was thinking, 'What have I skipped? What have I done wrong?'. 'Within an hour of the game I'd had a scan and the cruciate was fine, relief isn't the word. I'd probably got through the City game on pure adrenaline. So I think it was my body telling me just take your time. 'I won't lie, the fact I'm out of contract was on my mind and I wanted to be back sooner than the three months it took. 'Every game felt like another game off my career. But we did what was right and now there are no problems at all. 'I'll admit there were times when I thought I couldn't do it and my old man just told me 'no'. 'So when you've had the tears and those dark days, you appreciate every minute.' On the subject of dark days, both Newcastle and Sunderland are horribly out of form going into what has been billed as 'The Desperation Derby'. The Black Cats could be in the relegation zone by the time kick-off arrives, while Newcastle have lost their last three under John Carver. To suffer another loss in the derby could prove unforgivable in the eyes of supporters whose last victory arrived courtesy of Taylor's right boot in August, 2011. 'The good thing is we've got a cracking game now and if anything can rally us for the rest of the season then this is it,' says Taylor, who will start at right back. 'To be on a winning team on the ground where it all started for me would make everything worthwhile, all of the hard work and long days during those two years. 'But I remember that day so well. It was my first derby. I've played in two now and I'm yet to lose. 'Jonas (Gutierrez) won a foul just on the corner of the box. My first Premier League goal – for Wigan against Newcastle – was from that exact position, so I fancied it. 'I remember seeing Simon Mignolet edging out, almost inviting me to put it in the top corner. That's what I did. Steven Taylor tried to claim it, but he was nowhere near it. He tried to celebrate my goal by himself! 'I knew my dad and brother were in the away end celebrating and I just thought, 'Wow. They will be having some time in there'. Taylor is one of the most popular players at Newcastle for his consistent and hard working performances . 'Dan Gosling – one of my best mates – went through on goal in the last minute. Looking back, I'm probably relieved he didn't score to make it 2-0! 'I didn't realise at the time how big scoring the winner was and how much I would be remembered for just one goal. 'It'll be amazing if I'm coming back here in 10 years' time with my two boys and they're still singing that song.' Taylor adds: 'I'll always be a Newcastle fan. This club has been brilliant with me. I could have been the forgotten man but they stuck by me. 'Now I need to show them that I can stay fit. I've had some terrible luck, but I'd like to think I've got a lot left in me. 'So this final part of the season is massive for me – I would love to stay here.' And with that the supporter has his photo. 'What's going to happen on Sunday?' Taylor is asked. '1-0. Ryan Taylor. Over the wall,' he laughs. You can see why they like him in these parts. Taylor is out of contract at the end of the season and admits he does not know what the future has in store .
A woman who lost more than three stone in six months by using gastric band hypnosis was mistaken for her husband's new lover by his amazed colleagues. Andrea Lindsay, 43, from Prescot, Merseyside, transformed her appearance leaving her almost unrecognisable to friends and family. The mother-of-one shed more than three stone using an hypnosis app and dropped from a size 18 to a size ten to 12 in half a year. Andrea Lindsay, 43, from Prescot, Merseyside, shed more than three stone using an hypnosis app . Andrea hit her target weight in December 2014, shrinking from 14st to around 10st 5lb, before dying her bright blonde locks dark brown. And the bank worker received a curious compliment when her husband's colleagues thought Robbie had traded his wife in for a younger, slimmer model at a Christmas party when they failed to recognise her. Andrea said: 'I hit my target weight in December and we went to my husband's work party. A couple we knew walked in so I waved and said hello to them but they seemed really off with me. 'I thought they must have had an argument or something but we found out later that they didn't recognise me - they thought Rob had traded me in for a newer model. 'After losing the weight and dying my hair, they just didn't recognise me and thought that Rob had brought another woman with him! 'They had no idea who I was and had asked their friends where Andrea from last year was and why I wasn't with Rob.' Andrea, pictured here with her husband Robbie, says she'd tried every fad diet . After her transformation her husband's colleagues thought Robbie had traded his wife in for a younger, slimmer model at a Christmas party . 'Andrea says: 'People I have known for years have walked past me in the street as well and just ignored me. I didn't even think I looked that different.' The brunette says she has struggled with her weight all her life and says she'd tried every fad diet with little success ever since she reached a size 16/18 in her early teens. Andrea's new diet plan . Breakfast: Porridge . Lunch: Soup and a sandwich . Tea: Chilli with rice, cheese, and bread . Mid-morning: (as soon as I feel hungry) bowl of soup or a salad . Evening (as soon as I feel hungry) - a small bowl of chilli with cheese, bread or salad . But after she discovered Easy Loss' Virtual Gastric Band - Lose Weight Fast app, she has never looked back and said she still listens to the hypnosis sessions twice a day. The £4.99 app is designed to teach people to use their common sense when it comes to eating, rather than sticking to rules and restrictions, and just eating when they are hungry. Andrea said: 'As far back as I can remember, I have been overweight. Andrea says she'd had little success with weight loss ever since she reached a size 16/18 in her teens . But seeing as she never had any health issues she didn't really do anything about her weight . She says she always said she never wanted to be fat and 40, but got to 43 and was 'still fat' 'I tried absolutely everything - fad diets, cutting out food - but nothing ever worked. I would stick at it for a few weeks then just lose interest. There were too many rules and restrictions. 'I think because I never had any health issues I didn't really do anything about it. I always said I never wanted to be fat and 40, but I got to 43 and was still fat. 'It wasn't until I started doing hot yoga that I realised I was dissatisfied with myself, so I started looking for something to help me relax and that is when I found Easy Loss - it was just a complete fluke.' Andrea says: 'The ethos of my new lifestyle is that I don't stick to traditional meal times! I eat whenever I'm hungry, as soon as I'm hungry and stop eating as soon as I'm no longer hungry. 'If we went out for breakfast before I would have a fry up, now I have something lighter like Eggs Benedict.' Andrea is now preparing for a luxury two week getaway with husband Robbie, 45, to Mexico, and can't wait to show off her new bikini body on the beach. She said: 'I go away on Saturday and this is the first time I have actually felt body confident. I've spent £700 on a new holiday wardrobe, and I can't wait to wear everything. 'I got my old holiday clothes out and everything was just falling off me - I just can't believe now that I was ever that big. The difference is massive. After she started doing hot yoga she realised she was dissatisfied and that is when she found Easy Loss . 'I have three younger sisters and I have always been the fat one. They always shared each other's clothes and I could never do that, until now. They are amazed at the difference too. 'Since Easy Loss I eat a better balance and variety of food, a lot healthier. But we still have takeaways on a Friday, I don't feel deprived at all. 'It has changed my mind-set completely, it isn't a weight loss programme more a common sense set of guidelines to follow. My husband has started listening to it now as well.' Sue Peckham, co-creator of Virtual Gastric Band - Lose Weight Fast app said: 'Andrea has done so well with our app and we're all thrilled for her. She is a real inspiration and a Gold Member of our Easyloss Facebook Group. 'Her support and advice is a great help and really appreciated by other group members. We're really grateful for all she does to help other app users to achieve their weight loss goals.' The £4.99 app is designed to teach people to use their common sense when it comes to eating . Rather than restriction herself, Andrea - pictured with new clothes - has just been eating when she's hungry .
Bobby Moore's granddaughter celebrated her wedding with an intimate family celebration in London yesterday. Poppy Moore, 23, wed her childhood sweetheart Sam Myers at Chelsea Register Office with only 12 loved ones before hosting a reception for 50 at the Mayfair Hotel. The bride wore a knee-length white dress and carried a bouquet of white roses, which poignantly also contained a picture of her father Dean, who died in 2011 aged 43. Scroll down for video . Poppy Moore married Sam Myers at Chelsea Register Office yesterday . Sam Myers with bride Poppy, her mum Sara and grandmother Tina Moore at Chelsea Register Office . She wore her hair in a half up-do, with a Sixties-style beehive - perhaps in reference to her grandfather's heyday. Her chic dress had white flower detail embroidered on the bodice, while layers of tulle gave the skirt extra volume. Among the guests were Poppy's mother Sara and her grandmother Tina, Bobby's first wife. Poppy was only 18 months old when her famous grandfather died in February, 1993. The England and West Ham legend who captained the 1966's World Cup winning side was only 51 when he lost his battle with bowel cancer. She and Bobby's two other grandchildren Freddie and Ava marked the 20th anniversary of his death in 2013 by placing the ball on the spot for a West Hame home game, the club he captained for ten years. Poppy Moore poses with her new husband Sam Myers and mum Sara . Poppy is also involved with the Moore Family Fund to fight bowel cancer. Her mother Sara told The Mirror: 'Bobby would’ve been very proud of his granddaughter and very happy. She is a beautiful young lady and a credit to us all. 'It was a very special day, it was lovely. Her father Dean would have been so proud of her, too. It’s such a shame that he couldn’t be with us.' The Moore family experienced tragedy when Poppy's father Dean died young. Poppy, who was just 19 at the time, paid an emotional tribute to 'the best man in my life'. Bobby, who would have been 74 yesterday, met his first wife Tina in 1957 and the pair, who lived in Chigwell, Essex, had two children Dean and daughter Roberta. They separated in 1984 and divorced in 1986 and Bobby got together with Stephanie Parlane-Moore, who he married in 1991.

Gloating as he relaxes with his AK-47, these pictures show an al-Qaeda commander relaxing inside a palace in Yemen just days after terrorists liberated him from prison. Khalid Saeed Batarfi was a senior leader with al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) before he was jailed by Yemeni officials. Two days ago he was freed, along with 300 other inmates, as the terrorist group stormed the prison he was being held in, killing two guards. Scroll down for video . Khalid Saeed Batarfi poses for photographs inside the governor's palace in Mukalla, Yemen, days after he was released from prison by terrorists . Batarfi is among AQAP's top regional commanders, known for his leading role in a 2011-2012 battle with government troops during which extremists seized large parts of the south and east of Yemen. Pictures posted online today show the high-ranking terrorist grinning as he sits in the governor's palace in the city of Mukalla, pretending to be on the telephone as he wields an assault rifle. A second photograph shows Batarfi standing on a Yemeni flag in the abandoned building. The militants stormed the Central Prison of Mukalla with machine guns and rocket launchers during a midnight raid on Thursday. Rebels: Yemen's president fled to Saudi Arabia after Houthi rebels launched an attack on his palace in the capital Sana'a . After taking over the prison and freeing a number of members of AQAP, the terrorists overran government buildings and the city's port. According to CBS, AQAP Twitter accounts tweeted after the prison raid: 'All the brothers have been liberated, including Sheikh Batarfi who is now amongst his brothers, all praise to Allah.' Mukalla was previously under control of forces loyal to President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi, however it is not clear what resistance to the terrorists remains after he fled the capital Sana'a to Saudi Arabia as rebels launched an attack on his palace.
