Thousands of people have been forced to take refuge in temporary shelters and mosques. Some have been left homeless after their houses were destroyed, others have fled their homes amid fears of aftershocks and a possible tsunami. Rescue workers used diggers to remove rubble in their search efforts overnight on Wednesday. Others used their bare hands and shovels to find people. A few survivors were pulled out alive on Wednesday. More than 200 buildings were either seriously damaged or toppled in the earthquake. The Pidie Jaya region, on the north Aceh coast, was the hardest hit. The tremor hit just offshore early on Wednesday morning. Many of the homes in the area have corrugated tin roofs which collapsed. Hundreds have also been rushed to the sole functioning hospital, which has been overwhelmed by patients. Banda Aceh, the provincial capital, was one of the worst hit areas by the 2004 tsunami, caused by a massive earthquake.\nQ: Summarize the above article briefly in one sentence.\nA: A 6.5-magnitude earthquake struck Aceh province in Indonesia on Wednesday, killing at least 97 people.\n\nArticle: The 51-year-old was found in the grounds of her home in Royston, Hertfordshire, in July. She had been missing for three months. Her partner, Ian Stewart, 56, has denied murdering her. Pathologist Dr Nathaniel Cary told St Albans Crown Court it was \"possible that she was put down the well in an unconscious state and then drowned\". Ms Bailey's body was discovered in a cesspit beneath the garage submerged in liquid, including human excrement, the court heard. More on this and other news from Hertfordshire The body of her dachshund Boris was found next to her, together with a dog's toy. The Northumberland-born author of the Electra Brown series for teenagers, had last been seen alive on 11 April. The cause of Ms Bailey's death was officially listed as \"undetermined\", Dr Cary said. Post-mortem tests showed no signs of injury. There were no broken bones, no evidence of bruising or brain bleed, he told the jury. Analysis of her hair found traces of the sedative Zopiclone, which had been prescribed to Mr Stewart, had been in her system for several months and was present at the time of her death. Toxicologist Dr Mark Piper said side effects of the drug could include short term memory loss perhaps leading someone to think \"their mind was playing tricks\". The jury was told earlier that in the weeks before her death the writer had emailed friends describing how she felt confused and mentally impaired. Pathologist Dr Cary said if she had been sedated, Ms Bailey could have been killed without visual injuries by more \"subtle\" means. \"Subtle modes of death include smothering and compression of the neck by means including an arm lock, using the crook of the elbow... also called a sleeper hold, it is used in certain martial arts to reduce consciousness.\" Cross-examined by defence counsel Simon Russell Flint QC, Dr Cary said he was speculating, but added: \"On the basis of the case as a whole, it is my opinion that not only was she concealed by a third party but it seems likely she died at the hands of the third party by some means.\" He added: \"It is possible that she was put down the well in an unconscious state and then drowned... but impossible to confirm that given the amount of time the body was in water. \"I cannot discount it, it is one of a range of possibilities.\" The vet who carried out post-mortem tests on Ms Bailey's dog had been unable to ascertain the cause of death. No Zopiclone was found in its system and in a statement from Dr Jonathan Williams the jury was told it was not possible to \"confirm or refute whether the animal drowned\". The prosecution alleges Mr Stewart, who was due to marry Ms Bailey \"imminently\", murdered her for her money. The author was worth \"approaching \u00a34m\", the court heard earlier. Mr Stewart denies charges of murder, preventing a lawful burial, fraud and three counts of perverting the cause of justice. The jury has been sent home for the day. The trial is expected to last seven weeks.\nQ: Summarize the above article briefly in one sentence.\nA: Children's author Helen Bailey may have been alive when she was dropped into a cesspit at her home, a court has heard.\n\nArticle: The charity said tests confirmed all of the cats near Victor Avenue, in Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, had ingested the toxic substance. In the most recent case, seven-month-old Meereen died on Monday. An RSPCA spokesman said it was unclear whether the poisonings were accidental or deliberate. Updates on this story and more from Leicestershire Three other cats in the area have died in the last seven days, while another cat died two weeks ago. Meereen's \"devastated\" owner, Adria Pearce, said the cat came home on Friday evening and \"seemed to be shivering a little\". \"I haven't been able to stop crying since she died,\" she said. \"We found her behind the sofa, where she was foaming from the mouth and trying to be sick.\" Meereen was taken to the vets - where it was confirmed she had consumed antifreeze - and died three days later. RSPCA inspector, Andy Bostock, is appealing for everyone in the area to ensure pesticides and chemicals were stored safely. \"We are very concerned,\" he said. \"It is the time of year where people use antifreeze in their cars, so if you do, please make sure there are no leaks and any spills are cleaned up properly.\"\nQ: Summarize the above article briefly in one sentence.\nA: Five cats have died from antifreeze poisoning on or near the same street in the space of two weeks, the RSPCA has said.\n\nArticle: [[QUESTION]]\nQ: Summarize the above article briefly in one sentence.\nA:", "inputs": ["According to Cancer Research UK some 41, 000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer every year, but 10,700 will die of the disease, making it the fourth most common cause of cancer death - and second only to lung cancer in men. Given such a dire prognosis, and let's face it, given the financial profile of its victims, you might be forgiven for assuming that prostate cancer would be one of the most highly prioritised and well researched areas of oncology. Not a bit of it. Perhaps it's because men are squeamish, or don't like to talk about their health or visit the doctor, but prostate cancer has long been dubbed \"the Cinderella cancer\". \"We just don't make enough of it\" according to consultant oncologist Professor Neil Burnet. \"On the whole men are less vocal about their health, and older men tend to be even more stoical, preferring to grin and bear it. But it means men are poor advocates, and as a result prostate cancer has been overlooked\". Based at Addenbrooke's Hospital on the outskirts of Cambridge, Prof Burnet is trying to improve the targeting and efficiency of radiotherapy treatments, and to reduce toxicity in the healthy tissue surrounding the prostate. The technique, called Image Guided Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy Treatment uses imaging provided by a CT scan to target the tumour before a powerful but precisely shaped radiation dose is administered. \"What limits what we can do with radiotherapy are the side effects of the treatment, the toxicity.  And, since the prostate can move by up to a couple of centimetres from one day to the next, targeting the treatment is really important. The second half of this technology is in delivering intensity modulated radiotherapy, which allows us to match a higher dose of radiation to the shape of the tumour.\" But if Image Guided IMRT offers the prospect of better outcomes for men with advanced or aggressive prostate cancer, how much better might it be to get in at an earlier stage? That - at least in part - was the motivation behind the Collaborative Oncological Gene/Environment Study, or COGES, which has announced the discovery of 80 new genetic markers for breast, ovarian and prostate cancer. In one of the largest research projects of its kind scientists from Cambridge University and the Institute of Cancer Research in London looked at samples from more than 200,000 people - half with, and half without, cancer. The results include 23 new gene variants associated with prostate cancer and 16 with aggressive forms of the disease. Initially at least that should help with the development of a viable screening test for the disease. In the longer term it may present new targets for drug treatment and better diagnosis, and a greater understanding of the mechanisms and basic biology of prostate cancer. \"It's shocking, but we still don't have an adequate screening test for prostate cancer,\" says Ros Eeles, Professor of Oncogenetics at the Institute of Cancer Research and COGES study leader on prostate cancer. \"That's because the Prostate Specific Antigen, or PSA test, just isn't accurate enough and you'd have to treat between 12 and 48 men unnecessarily to save a single life. With this new information we could have a viable test in five to eight years\". If that still seems a long way off, surgical techniques have advanced dramatically when it comes to prostate cancer. These days consultant urologist Professor David Neal uses the DaVinci surgical robot to perform prostate surgery. Sitting at a computer console that looks like it would be more at home in an amusement arcade than an operating theatre, Prof Neal can perform a prostatectomy without ever touching his patient. And because the robotic arms of the device (which looks a little like a crab hovering over the operating table) are much thinner than the surgeon's, and the grappling and cutting tools at the sharp end are much smaller, what was once a major operation is now less invasive. As with Image Guided Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy collateral damage to surrounding healthy tissue is kept to a minimum. \"The DaVinci robot has made a huge difference to prostate surgery\" says Prof Neal. \"It's still a major operation, but we can be very precise about what we remove and the function we're able to save. That's got to be good news for the patient\".", "McQueen, 20, came through Southampton's youth ranks and has played one first-team game - as a sub against Sunderland in the FA Cup in February 2014. \"As good as the under-21s is, you want to be pushing yourself and the next step for me was playing football,\" he told BBC Essex. \"I've got the opportunity here so I've got to take it as well as I can.\" Find all the latest football transfers on our dedicated page.", "Jaeseok Lee, 40, collapsed at an address in High Street, New Malden, at about 01:20 GMT on Wednesday.

He is in his second season at Bristol and has scored 167 points in 28 appearances for the Championship side he joined from Ospreys in May 2014. Morgan was named Championship player of the season in his debut campaign in England. Blues head coach Danny Wilson worked with the player at Bristol and with Wales under-20s and expects Morgan to play most of the time at full-back. \"He has the ability to cover other positions but it's primarily full-back that we have recruited him for,\" said Wilson. \"It dovetails in with what Wales have done with Matthew recently. Matthew on our (artificial) surface (at the Arms Park) will be a real threat with his footwork and his ability to beat defenders.\" Morgan played 66 games for the Ospreys but found his game-time at fly-half limited by Dan Biggar and the emerging Sam Davies, prompting his move to Bristol.", "Russia is fuming, in the words of BBC Moscow correspondent Steve Rosenberg, but US politicians have not minced their words either.

Yesterday the US administration, without presenting any facts, any evidence, announced a new wave of sanctions against Russia.\" Maria Zakharova, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman, in a post on Facebook headlined 'Obama's Coming Out' \"The people who have lived eight years in the White House are not an administration but a group of vindictive, unimaginative, foreign policy failures. Today [US President Barack] Obama admitted this officially. \"Most surprising of all is that after failing to record any achievements in the international arena in the history of his presidency, the Nobel laureate has managed to sign off not with a flourish, but a blot... \"Today America, the American people, has been humiliated by its own president. Not by international terrorists, not by enemy troops. This time it's Washington's chief delivering the slap in the face, ramping up the workload for the incoming team...\" Zakharova says Jews backed Trump \"Such actions of the administration in Washington are the demonstration, unfortunately, of an unpredictable, even aggressive, I can say, foreign policy. We think that such decisions of the acting administration, which is supposed to be in office for three more weeks, pursue two aims: finally (irrevocably?) spoiling US-Russian relations and, obviously, having an impact on the foreign policy of the future administration of the president-elect [Donald Trump].\" \"What these individuals were doing were basically collecting intelligence. They were intelligence officers operating here and using these compounds, one in New York, one in Maryland, for intelligence collection purposes. And what we are saying today is, in response to and in order to impose consequences for the Russian government's increasing harassment and aggression toward our personnel in Moscow, and, of course, their malicious cyber-activities, interfering and an effort to interfere in our election process, we are imposing consequences.\" \"They [the Russians] are trying to destabilize democracy all over the world, not just here.

I'm going to introduce sanctions, they will be bipartisan that names Putin as an individual, his inner circle, for not only hacking into our political systems but trying to destabilize democracy throughout the world.\" \"We need to get to the bottom of this. We need to find out exactly what was done and what the implications of the attacks were, especially if they had an effect on our election. \"There's no doubt they were interfering and no doubt it was a cyber-attack. The question now is how much and what damage and what should the United States of America do? And so far, we've been totally paralyzed.\" \"Russia does not share America's interests. In fact, it has consistently sought to undermine them, sowing dangerous instability around the world. While today's action by the administration is overdue, it is an appropriate way to end eight years of failed policy with Russia.

She said she was unhappy with the support from the Welsh Amateur Boxing Association (WABA). Chairman David Francis said the organisation did all it could to help. The Association of International Boxing Associations (AIBA) said Brace was ineligible to compete for Team Wales because she had competed in professional kickboxing in the past, which she denied. Organisers of the kickboxing tournaments she competed in have also since confirmed she did so on an amateur basis. A further rule states any boxer returning from another individual contact sport should apply to an international committee to become eligible to box again. Brace said she was never told about the paperwork, which had to be submitted by WABA, and felt the association let her down. She now trains at Bristol Boxing Gym and has her first professional fight in Newport on 30 October. She added: \"I would never go back to Team Wales after this, because if you don't have confidence in the people who are supposed to be fighting your corner, at the end of day, what's the point?\" Mr Francis said the whole incident was \"regrettable\".", "He was trying out a 45m (150ft) high zip wire at Victoria Park, where the Games are being shown on big screens.

A year after his release he came to the UK and in October raped and robbed a woman in a Leicester park. Podlaszczyk, 33, was jailed again on Wednesday for a minimum of seven and a half years. He had previously admitted nine different charges including rape, sexual assault and robbery. Leicester Crown Court heard Podlaszczyk attacked a 55-year-old woman as she walked to the bus station through Bede Park shortly after 07:00. He punched her to the ground, dragged her to a secluded part and raped her. During the attack he took her bank card and demanded her Pin number in order to steal \u00c2\u00a320 from her account. He also took her mobile phone and \u00c2\u00a31.15 from her purse saying he needed money for beer. Prosecuting, Jim Thomas said the woman was left with injuries to her knees and face, including a denture being knocked out. Reading a statement from the victim, Mr Thomas said: \"She is frightened to go out and is constantly worried when there's a knock at the door.\" Podlaszczyk had been released from prison in Poland in July 2015 and settled in the UK last August. Judge Philip Head called the attack \"sadistic\" and described the defendant as a \"damaged and dangerous\" killer. He said the defendant took \"great pleasure from it [the attack] by humiliating her by some disgusting actions\". \"This was motivated by sex and he thought he could profit at the same time.\"", "Valery Gergiev, a supporter of Russia's President Vladimir Putin, conducted the Mariinsky Symphony Orchestra, from St Petersburg, at Palmyra's Roman Theatre. Last July, IS posted footage online showing some of its fighters carrying out killings in the ancient theatre. Syrian forces, backed by Russian air strikes, retook the historic site. Palmyra in pictures Mr Gergiev led the orchestra through pieces by Johann Sebastian Bach, Sergei Prokofiev and Rodion Shchedrin, in front of a crowd of Russian soldiers, government ministers and journalists. Pictures of the concert, broadcast on Russian state television, were occasionally interrupted by footage of military action - showing Russian military backing for Syrian government forces as they liberated Palmyra from IS militants. Mr Gergiev was until recently principal conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra and is music director of the Munich Philharmonic Orchestra. In 2014, he backed Mr Putin over the annexation of the Crimea from Ukraine. In 2008, he performed in the capital of South Ossetia when Russia and Georgia were fighting over the territory. The maestro described the concert as a protest against the barbarism and violence exhibited by Islamic State militants who had used the city's Roman amphitheatre to execute prisoners. The Russian president also addressed the audience, by video link from his Black Sea residence in Sochi. He called terrorism a contagion of which the world needed to rid itself, and said the fact the concert was taking place at all was \"surprising\". \"Today's action involved major inconvenience and dangers for everyone, being in a country at war close to where hostilities are still ongoing. That has demanded great strength and personal courage from you all,\" he said. However, UK Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said the concert was \"a tasteless attempt to distract attention from the continued suffering of millions of Syrians. It shows that there are no depths to which the regime will not sink\". This is about more than just music. By organising a concert in the ruins of Palmyra, Russia wants the world to see that it is making a positive contribution in Syria: bringing peace and stability to the country, and, in the case of Palmyra, saving a Unesco heritage site. Moscow will be hoping that images of its classical musicians in Syria will reinforce the message that Russia is a force for good. Such a musical message will be well received back home. For months now, Russian TV has been assuring viewers Russia's military intervention in Syria has benefited the world by taking on international terrorism. But Western officials remain suspicious of Russia's intentions. Moscow has faced accusations that it has not done enough to rein in Syrian government forces. The Russians deny that and accuse America of not using its influence with the Syrian opposition to halt the fighting. One of the soloists at the concert was cellist Sergei Roldugin, a friend of Putin's, who was recently named as the owner of offshore companies in the so-called Panama Papers. He denies all wrongdoing. Islamic State destroyed a number of monuments during its 10-month occupation of Palmyra and its associated Unesco World Heritage site. Two 2,000-year-old temples, an arch and funerary towers were left in ruins. The jihadist group, which has also demolished several pre-Islamic sites in neighbouring Iraq, believes that such structures are idolatrous. While some treasured monuments were destroyed, much of the historic site was left undamaged. It is not the first time Mr Gergiev has performed in a war-torn city. In August 2008, the native Ossetian conductor took the Mariinsky Theatre Symphony Orchestra to the ruins of Tskhinvali in the separatist Georgian region of South Ossetia, heavily damaged in the short Russian-Georgian war that year. Mr Gergiev also conducted a charity concert in Tokyo for victims of the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2012, and he led a charity concert tour to raise funds for victims of Russia's Beslan school massacre in 2004.", "He made the pledge in a Ramadan message to Muslims, who have been worst affected by the ban. The government shut 13 Somalia-linked firms in April, saying it wanted to prevent militant Islamists from using them to finance attacks. Kenyans Somalis accused the government of blanket punishment. Somalis around the world rely heavily on the firms to do business and send cash to relatives in Somalia, where the banking sector is almost non-existent. Mr Kenyatta, in his message to mark the Islamic holy month, said he had noted proposals to lift the ban on the firms. He had therefore directed the central bank to \"immediately issue comprehensive regulations\" for the activities of the firms, \"upon which their suspension would be lifted\". The ban was imposed after Somali militant Islamist group al-Shabab killed 148 people in an attack on Garissa University College in north-eastern Kenya. There has been a similar crackdown on the companies in the UK and US where the governments have adopted strict money-laundering laws making it difficult for banks to deal with them. The United Nations estimates that Somalis in the diaspora, almost all of whom are Muslim, send home about $1.6bn (\u00c2\u00a31.1bn) annually, significantly more than foreign aid. More than 40% of Somalis receive remittances, the bulk of which are used for basic needs, including food, clothes, medicine and education, according to a UN survey.

He said he was \"absolutely devastated\" when he discovered the blaze at the family business on Bitterne Road West. \"When I was coming over the Itchen bridge , I saw the smoke and I began screaming.

A warrant canary is a statement saying a company has not received secret requests for user data by government or law enforcement officers. It is named after the birds that were taken down mineshafts to alert workers to toxic gases. If the canary died in the mine the workers knew they had to leave quickly. Similarly, the existence of a warrant canary on a website indicates the \"all clear\". When it disappears, visitors might assume the website has received classified requests for data. Many websites publish a warrant canary in an effort to be transparent with visitors. The concept gained popularity after the extent of US government surveillance was revealed by whistleblower Edward Snowden. In the US, law enforcement can issue requests for user data that come with a gagging order, preventing the demand from being disclosed. Demands known as national security letters are designed to allow law enforcement agencies to conduct an investigation without interference or alerting the target. But critics say the confidential nature of national security letters, which can be issued without a court order, makes them ripe for abuse by law enforcement. Reddit, Adobe and Tumblr are among the sites that have published warrant canaries. The disappearance of a warrant canary usually only reveals that a website has received at least one secret surveillance request. They are often written in broad terms, as their legality has not been tested in court. \"The more practically useful and informative they are, the more legally risky they are too,\" said Brett Max Kaufman, a lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union. Before it was killed, Reddit's warrant canary said: \"Reddit has never received a National Security Letter, an order under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or any other classified request for user information.\" One Reddit member asked whether websites could print an individual warrant canary on every member's profile, making it immediately obvious when a specific user had been targeted by a secret request. \"The government would have a pretty strong argument in that case that the removal of the individual's canary was simply an end-run around the gag order, and that it would jeopardise the government interests in completing its investigation without interference,\" said Mr Kaufman. \"That's not to say an individualised canary could never be lawful.\" While the disappearance of a warrant canary could indicate that a company has received a classified data request, it remains possible that Reddit removed the canary to avoid a future fight over its legality. \"I strongly suspect it is the first,\" said Alex Abdo of the ACLU. \"Unless they received a national security request, nothing else would have changed between the 2014 transparency report and now. \"If they abandoned it for the second reason, Reddit likely would not have issued the very cryptic statement that they could not comment on the disappearance of the canary.\" Reddit did not respond to the BBC's request for comment. One Reddit member questioned whether the government could force a website to falsely keep its warrant canary online, disguising the existence of a national security letter. \"If the government asked a company to leave its warrant canary up (and therefore communicate something false to the public), the company would have the right to challenge any gag (under the First Amendment... or under certain provisions of the USA Freedom Act) in court,\" said Mr Kaufman. \"But if a court upheld the government's request... the public would be none the wiser, at least for some time. \"Indeed, that would be the entire objective from the government's perspective.\" When asked whether the disappearance of Reddit's canary was a cause for alarm, Mr Abdo said it was \"difficult to know\". \"It's possible that the request was very targeted and in pursuit of someone we would all agree should be investigated,\" he said. \"But we don't know the facts at this point, and we don't even know which legal authority the government was relying on. \"And we might not know either of those things for a long time.\"", "Welshman Davies won his second gold in Italy with an F42 discus world record after his shot success on Sunday. Hermitage also won gold number two with a world record in the T37 200m. Weir claimed his third gold, again leading home team-mate Richard Chiassaro, this time in the T54 800m. There was also a superb silver for London 2012 double bronze medallist David Devine in the T13 1500m after over three years out injured and for veteran Graeme Ballard (T36 100m), while Stephen Miller (F32 club) and Isaac Towers (T34 200m) took bronzes. Davies had a best throw of 54.14m, beating his previous record of 49.59 and his winning margin in the event, which is not part of the Rio programme, was more than eight metres. \"I am absolutely delighted with that result,\" said the 25-year-old. \"To throw a personal best on the main stage is something every athlete wants to do. For me, I was even more shocked because I haven't been doing too much discus this year as I have been focusing on the shot put for Rio, but I know there is a lot more in the tank. \"I know I can throw a long way but the fact that I am surprised myself is very exciting.\" Hermitage followed up her T37 400m success with another superb performance, clocking 27.21 to beat France's Marie-Francois Elie's 28.35 set at the 2013 Worlds in Lyon. \"I'm just so happy to get the world record and win a second European gold medal,\" she said. \"The 400m on Monday was very pressurised but the 200m isn't a Rio event for me, however it is something I still really enjoy.

Mexico's attorney general said a member of Guzman's legal team, described as the mastermind, was also arrested. Guzman, head of the Sinaloa cartel, escaped from a high-security prison through a specially dug tunnel. Attorney General Arely Gomez told reporters on Wednesday that the suspected mastermind of the escape had repeatedly entered Altiplano prison to visit Guzman and update him on the operation's progress. She also said Guzman's brother-in-law had supervised the construction of the mile-long escape tunnel and organised transport. \"Today we are able to affirm that the group responsible for planning, organising and carrying out the escape from outside the prison has been broken up,\"  Ms Gomez said, without naming the suspects. The development comes days after officials revealed the drugs lord had suffered face and leg injuries when he narrowly evaded a police operation to recapture him in north-west Mexico earlier this month. Ms Gomez confirmed on Wednesday that after his escape, Guzman travelled by land to the city of Queretaro, from where he caught a small plane to his home state of Sinaloa. His escape was an embarrassment for Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, who Guzman taunted on Twitter after the event. Several prison officials have already been arrested under suspicion of giving inside help to Guzman, who fled through a tunnel that ran 1.5km from under a shower in his cell to outside the prison. Guzman was first arrested in Guatemala in 1993 and spent nearly a decade in another maximum-security Mexican jail before escaping, reportedly in a laundry basket. He was on the run for 13 years before being held again in 2014 after a series of high-profile arrests of associates and covert surveillance by the US authorities.", "The man's bike was struck by a lorry at 17:15, near a petrol station north of the roundabout junction with the A830.

Droudis's boyfriend, Man Haron Monis, took 18 people hostage in a Lindt cafe in central Sydney in 2014. The 16-hour siege ended with the deaths of Monis and two hostages when police stormed the building. Monis had been charged with being an accessory to his ex-wife's killing, and was on bail at the time of the siege. The Supreme Court of New South Wales heard that Monis planned the 2013 murder and Droudis carried it out. The victim, identified by the pseudonym Helen Lee, was stabbed 18 times before being doused in petrol and set alight outside an apartment in western Sydney. After the trial, Justice Peter Johnson ruled that Monis recruited Droudis to murder his ex-wife. \"The offender uncritically adopted and espoused Monis's foul beliefs and acted in public support of him in public protests,\" he said in his sentencing remarks on Wednesday. The judge described Monis as \"an evil man\" whose death was \"a result of his own criminal and murderous acts\". \"No-one mourns his passing and many have been left to grapple the consequences of his destructive acts,\" he said. The judge acknowledged claims that Droudis had been repeatedly assaulted by Monis. Droudis was sentenced to a maximum 44 years in jail with a non-parole period of 33 years. Detective Inspector Jason Dickinson, who worked on the case, said he was satisfied with the sentence handed to Droudis. \"This was a brutal and callous crime and I think the sentence today has reflected that brutality,\" he told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. The victim's family made a statement outside court, thanking the judge, prosecutors and police. \"Today we are very happy that justice has been served to our only daughter,\" the statement said. The findings of an inquest into the cafe siege are due to be handed down this year.

Ms Stewart said: \"I think it's fair to say Rugby World Cup 2015 in Newcastle has been a huge success. From the games themselves to the atmosphere inside the Fanzone, we've had a remarkable two weekends. \"We've welcomed thousands of international visitors who have all contributed to the estimated \u00a343m of economic impact hosting the tournament has brought to Newcastle. \"I have no doubt we'll be feeling the positive effects Rugby World Cup 2015 for many years to come.\" The third and final game at the stadium was held on Saturday with Scotland beating Samoa 36-33.

Able seaman Charles Lewis, 91, from Calmore, Hampshire said he was \"honoured and delighted\". The Foreign Office initially did not allow Russia to honour the veterans as it broke the rules on foreign medals. The Russian embassy said the convoys allowed Russian soldiers to defeat the Germans on the Eastern Front. Mr Lewis said: \"I certainly don't see myself as a hero - far from it - and I think all my friends and colleagues, many of whom sadly are no longer with us, would regard us as simply doing our bit for the war effort. \"Although I have to say that Churchill's famous quote about the Arctic convoys' missions through the North Sea in winter as being 'the worst journey on earth' did strike a chord  - then and now.\" \u2022They consisted of vessels which travelled from Britain to northern Russia to resupply the Soviet Union during World War II \u2022Under constant threat of attack by German U-boats and aircraft, the craft also had to deal with severe cold, storms, and ice floes \u2022By May 1945, the Arctic route had claimed 104 merchant and 16 military vessels.

The Russian Embassy wrote to survivors in May 2012 that it intended to award them with the Medal of Ushakov as a symbol of the country's gratitude. But the move was blocked by the Foreign Office as its rules stated British soldiers could not receive a foreign medal if the act happened more than five years ago. The British Government created the Arctic Star in 2012 following a long campaign for the convoy veterans to be recognised. But campaigners believed veterans should still be able to receive the Russian accolade. The Foreign Office allowed an \"exception to the rules\" last year and President Vladimir Putin presented the first medals during his visit to London on 16 June 2013.

The 50 mark separates manufacturing growth from contraction, with the sector now just on the positive side. Manufacturing failed to boost overall UK growth during 2015 and early 2016. UK economic growth slowed to 0.4% in the first quarter of the year from 0.6% in late 2015, propped up by the services sector. Rob Dobson, senior economist at survey compilers Markit, said: \"The manufacturing sector looks likely to act as an increased drag on the economy in the second quarter. \"There are also signs that increased client uncertainty resulting from slower growth and the forthcoming EU referendum are weighing on investment spending and business decision-making in general.\" The report found that more than a third of manufacturers surveyed believed uncertainty over the EU vote has had an impact on their business, with 8% saying the effect was \"strongly detrimental\". The survey showed the investment goods industry experienced a difficult month, with production falling at the quickest pace since early 2013. Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, said the manufacturing sector was \"essentially at a standstill in May\". Ruth Miller, UK economist at Capital Economics, said the small improvement for manufacturing in May did little to change the fundamental picture of a struggling industrial sector. \"Granted, the headline PMI index recovered from its three-year low in April, ticking up from an upwardly revised 49.4 to 50.1 in May, above the consensus expectation of 49.6,\" she said. Ms Miller said this was still far below the average since the economic recovery picked up at the start of 2013. However, she thought the situation would \"improve for UK manufacturers later this year\". Overall new orders rose in May. Meanwhile, some firms said they were already pricing in the expectation that inflation will rise. Annual consumer price inflation currently stands at 0.3%.", "It will add an extra 600 seats a day for commuters into the Welsh capital after being criticised for having too many overcrowded trains. Arriva Trains Wales, whose Wales and Borders franchise expires in 2018, is adding morning weekday services into Cardiff Central from Barry and Radyr. Economy minister Ken Skates had said Arriva's profits were \"too high.\" The Wales and Borders franchise - which is one of the UK's most heavily subsidised, receiving between \u00c2\u00a3110m-\u00c2\u00a3160m a year - has seen passenger numbers rise from 18 million in 2003 to 30 million. About 265,000 people use Cardiff Central station weekly and a BBC investigation found overcrowding in Cardiff stations during the morning commute was rising at a faster rate than anywhere else outside London, according to figures from the Department for Transport. Arriva Trains Wales now plans to add extra capacity and extra trains from 22 May on the following routes Arriva Trains Wales said the additional trains were \"subject to railway approval processes\" but the announcement is \"one of the most significant improvements to valleys commuters in a decade\". It said to implement the changes, the operator \"needed to remove one midday Penarth service and one midday Barry service\". The firm has a zero growth contract - which means it has the same number of trains it had when it began operations in 2003. It said the additions \"would not have been possible\" without Network Rail's recent \u00c2\u00a3300m signalling upgrade works and new platform eight at Cardiff Central. \"This is one of the most significant improvements to valleys commuters in a decade, since the opening of the Ebbw Vale line,\" said Arriva Trains Wales customer services director, Lynne Milligan. \"With only a limited number of trains in our fleet and the lack of availability in the UK we have had to work hard to get the most from what we've got.\" Network Rail Wales said \"more trains are travelling through Cardiff than ever before\".", "It is a talent that helped him move from being bankrupt, aged 32, to becoming a multimillionaire by the time he was 48. Along the way he created and sold best-selling upmarket crisps brand Tyrrells, and won a high-profile battle against supermarket giant Tesco. Now 56, and the founder and owner of Chase Vodka, a luxury version of the spirit made from potatoes grown on his farm, the serial entrepreneur says: \"People love stories, the real stories behind things. \"And the media was very important to me from the first days of Tyrrells. \"I was a guy who had been beaten up by the supermarkets, and people love to support the underdog.\" The son of potato farmers who lived near the Herefordshire town of Leominster, Mr Chase bought the family farm from his dad when he was 20 after he \"managed to find a bank manager brave enough to lend me \u00a3200,000\". As the cost of potatoes can rise and fall sharply, business was up and down for the next 12 years, until torrential rain in 1992 meant he couldn't harvest his crop, which he had to leave to rot in the fields. Overextended financially, the business collapsed, and Mr Chase had to file for bankruptcy. He says: \"I was very ashamed and embarrassed.\" After \"running away to Australia\" for a few months, he returned to Herefordshire, and was able to borrow funds to buy back the farm from the receivers, and start up in business again. This time, to make extra money, he became a potato trader, buying spuds from a number of farms, and then selling them on to supermarkets. Yet while he got himself back on his feet financially, Mr Chase says he became increasingly frustrated that supermarkets would reject potatoes that weren't \"cosmetically perfect\". He adds: \"I'd send off 10 loads of spuds every day, and I'd be getting five back. It was very painful how the supermarkets were treating us farmers.\" Mr Chase's life-changing moment came in 2002 when he found out that rejected potatoes were being bought up by the UK operation of US crisp-maker Kettle. At the time Kettle was one of new companies making so-called \"posh crisps\", potato crisps which were cut a little thicker than the mass-market brands, and fried by hand. Despite having no crisp-making experience or knowledge, Mr Chase was convinced he could set up his own upmarket crisps brand. So he phoned a few UK crisp-makers to ask if he could see how they did things, and all said \"no\". Undeterred, he flew out to the US and visited facilities in Pennsylvania and Colorado. Returning to the UK, he built a crisp-making facility at the family farm, and Tyrrells [taking its name from the property] was up and running six months later. Quick to tell his story to local newspapers to build up publicity, Mr Chase hit the road to spend two weeks visiting independent food shops across the UK with samples of his crisps. He says: \"Tyrrells grew and grew very quickly, and it was a brilliant cash cow. We'd sell the bags to shops for \u00a31 and they would retail them for \u00a32. For us the net profit was 35%.\" Supermarkets such as Waitrose soon followed suit, but Mr Chase was adamant that he would not sell to the largest - Tesco - because he didn't like what he saw as the pressure it put on farmers to lower their prices. Then one day in 2006 a friend told him that Tesco was selling Tyrrells' crisps. It transpired that Tesco had been buying them on the grey market, and selling them below the recommended retail price. An incensed Mr Chase demanded that Tesco stop selling them. After the supermarket refused, Mr Chase started a media campaign that included an appearance on BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Tesco then did back down. With sales of Tyrrells crisps continuing to grow over the next few years, and annual turnover hitting \u00a314m, Mr Chase borrowed money from his bank to expand production. The condition the bank set was that he had to bring in a management team to help him run the business. Mr Chase, who had previously been very hands on, and liked to help out with all parts of the business, says that bringing in new managers ultimately changed the business - to its detriment. \"We got to a stage where I didn't like where the business was going,\" he says. \"We were employing corporate people who were arranging meetings about more meetings.\" Unhappy with Tyrrells' new big business ethos, and going through a \"messy divorce\", Mr Chase - who was the sole shareholder - decided to sell up in 2008 to a private capital business for almost \u00a340m. Looking for a new business venture, and with the new owners of Tyrrells choosing to buy their potatoes from elsewhere, Mr Chase came up with the idea of turning his spuds into premium vodka. So with money no longer a problem, he bought a distillation system, and Chase Vodka was born. Aimed at the luxury end of the market, it retails for \u00a335 a bottle. While Mr Chase admits it isn't anywhere near as profitable as selling crisps, it appears to be very much a labour of love. And focused very much on exports, he spends a lot of time travelling the world to build up sales. And showing that he has lost little of his public relations skills, every year he flies influential barmen and women from around the world to visit his farm in Herefordshire to see how the potatoes are grown, and vodka is made. Also now making a gin and a whisky, the Chase Distillery sells 10,000 bottles a week. Mr Chase says: \"You have to tell people your story if you want to build your brand. But there has to be real DNA behind it if you want to be successful.\"", "17 August 2017 Last updated at 07:56 BST It seems to have the body parts from different dino species.

His wife Lynne previously said doctors told her the illness was \"caused by heading too many balls\". Turner also played for Cambridge United, Luton, Swindon and Southend. He started his playing career at Peterborough in 1969 and made more than 300 appearances. His playing career also included time in the US. Turner retired as a player in 1984 and took over as boss at Cambridge United a year later, managing them until 1990.

The country had lost 20,000 people through starvation, with a further 980,000 classed as malnourished. The bulbs were donated by the Dutch government to the International Bomber Command Centre (IBCC). A ceremony at the cathedral to unveil the mosaic was attended by representatives from The Netherlands, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Poland, Germany and the US. Bomber Command veterans also met with some who had been helped by the campaign. Nicky Barr, from the IBCC, an education facility being built in Lincoln, said Operation Manna was the difference between \"people living or dying\". The mission followed a blockade of supplies by German forces in retaliation for Dutch rail companies going on strike in support of an Allied offensive, she said. The winter of 1944/45 was also particularly harsh, compounding the problem of food shortages. David Fellows, who flew missions from RAF Binbrook in Lincolnshire as part of Operation Manna, said: \"We used to go across to Holland every fifth year and we used to get hugs from young children who would say 'thank you for saving my grandmother', but to meet some of the people who were there at the time is highly emotional.\" Recalling the missions, he said: \"We knew there were thousands of Dutch people dying - and they were in dire straits.\" He said despite concerns the Germans \"could open fire on us, the RAF being the RAF took the decision to fly anyway\".

Researchers said the role of the hippocampus in the brain was key. And they said the findings could point to new ways of teaching teenagers. The research team, from Harvard, Columbia and California universities, set out to test whether adolescents' typical reward-seeking behaviour could also make them better at learning from good or bad outcomes. They asked 41 teenagers, aged 13 to 17, and 31 adults, aged 20 to 30, to play a game based on pictures while scanning some of each group's brains using MRI. In the game, the teenagers got more answers correct and memory tests showed they were also better at remembering the detail of why they chose the answers they did. The study said this meant they were better at learning from their experiences - which would equip them well for leaving home and gaining independence as adults. When they looked at the teenagers' brain scans, the researchers found activity in two areas of the brain - the hippocampus and the striatum - whereas adults mainly used their striatum. They said these connections between two important parts of the growing brain explained why they performed better. Often referred to as the brain's memory headquarters, it is a seahorse-shaped collection of cells in the middle of the brain which stores and sorts memories and is also linked to the ability to navigate from one place to another. It is an area of the brain involved in planning and decision making, which is also important for linking action and reward. The part played by the hippocampus to reinforce learning during adolescence had not been recognised before, the study in Neuron said. It is thought to play a key role in the formation of powerful memories during an important stage in life. Juliet Davidow, a psychology researcher at Harvard University, said the findings could inspire new ways of teaching teenagers. \"If you frame something positively, it could be the case that adolescents will remember things about the learning experience better. \"In everyday life, they're paying attention to their environment in a way that is different from adults.\" The researchers are now looking at what other situations or experiences activate this link between the striatum and hippocampus in teenage brains.", "Julia Knight, 56, had denied trying to kill Irene Robson, 81, but admitted administering the insulin at Horton Hospital in Banbury in October 2014.

But John Findlay, who was abused while a pupil in the care of Aberlour House in Moray, said money would be better spent supporting victims. He said the inquiry was \"yet another process\" rather than progress towards helping people. Mr Findlay told BBC Scotland's Timeline programme how he had spoken publically before about what happened to him, but has not been contacted about giving evidence to the inquiry. He was abused by one of his teachers, who is no longer alive, at Aberlour House, a prep school for Gordonstoun private school in Moray which Mr Findlay went on to attend.

I was convinced by him that I imagined it, that nothing happened.\" Mr Findlay said what happened to him as a child \"tainted\" his adult life, including work and personal relationships.

A spokesperson said: \"It will focus on the systemic institutional failures which saw many of our most vulnerable children, including those in the care of the state, abused by the very individuals who were there to care for them. \"We want that inquiry to be able to undertake its work in a timescale that can address the issues raised by survivors. \"Scotland is one of the few countries in the world that has dedicated funding for support services for adult survivors of child abuse. \"We have made real progress in delivering what survivors told us they wanted, including a greatly expanded support fund of \u00c2\u00a313.5m over five years to co-ordinate access to and deliver resources, integrated care and support for those who were abused in care.\" The spokesperson said Deputy First Minister John Swinney had also committed to a consultation on redress, pledging to work with survivors to consider the wide range of differing views on the subject. The spokesperson added: \"Last year, we introduced legislation to make it easier to take civil action against historic child abuse, and we also reviewing the child protection system to ensure it is as effective as it can be.\"", "The singer died in April from an accidental overdose of the painkiller fentanyl, but he did not leave a will and did not have any children. Reports in Minnesota say his estate may be worth at least $300m (\u00c2\u00a3227m). A judge has now ordered genetic tests to be carried out on six people with claims to be relatives of the singer. Four siblings or half-siblings, as well as two women believed to be a niece and a grand-niece, will be tested. Genetic tests had already ruled out the claim of a man in jail in Colorado who said he was Prince's son. And, as part of the latest ruling, Judge Kevin Eide decided a claim by a Georgia woman, who said she and Prince were once married, was not valid. She had said the CIA was keeping their marriage record secret. Minneapolis' Star Tribune newspaper said the case was thrown out against five men who said Prince was their father. Prince was found unresponsive in a lift at his Paisley Park Studios on the morning of 21 April, local officials said. First responders tried to revive him with CPR but he was pronounced dead shortly afterwards. Prescription painkillers were in the 57-year-old's possession following his death, officials told US media in May. He is believed to have suffered from knee and hip pain from years of performing. According to the autopsy report, Prince self-administered fentanyl, an opioid many times more powerful than heroin. A singer, songwriter, arranger and multi-instrumentalist, Prince recorded more than 30 albums. His best known hits include Let's Go Crazy and When Doves Cry.", "Media playback is not supported on this device The striker nodded home Craig Curran's cross and superb control allowed him to drill in a second. Scott Boden's shot, touched by defender Andrew Davies, was allowed to stand despite referee Andrew Dallas whistling before the ball had gone in. But Boyce replied with a towering header before a thumping shot from Ross Draper set up a frantic finale. The hosts pressed for a leveller in the final 15 minutes, with Jake Mulraney and Liam Polworth going close with fierce strikes. But County held on to pick up their first Premiership points, while Richie Foran's side are the only team yet to get off the mark after two matches. With both teams exiting the League Cup and opening with league defeats last weekend, the game opened at a whirlwind pace. Curran came into the County side to renew his often profitable partnership with Boyce and it paid off instantly. An inch perfect cross found Boyce completely neglected by the home defence and the Northern Irishman took advantage with an accurate downward header from 10 yards. Inverness were down to 10 men when the second goal arrived on 26 minutes. Full-back Kevin McNaughton hobbled off with a knee injury and before his replacement, Lewis Horner, could get on, Boyce took Richard Foster's deep cross down with a sublime first touch before cutting past David Raven and smashing a low shot confidently into the corner. County were well on top but the home team pulled one back in unusual circumstances shortly before half time. Draper lofted a long ball over the top for Boden to chase and the striker squeezed a shot against the challenging Davies, with the ball spinning into the far corner. Meanwhile, Dallas had blown his whistle and appeared to point to his assistant indicating a halt in play, only to immediately reverse that decision. County players crowded the official, with goalkeeper Scott Fox saying he had been distracted by the whistle, although he did make a wholehearted dive. Jim McIntyre's side put that behind them when Boyce completed his hat-trick early in the second half, rising at the back post to crash in a powerful header from a Christopher Routis free-kick. Inverness gave themselves hope when Draper crashed a powerful low effort past Fox from the edge of the penalty area. County then had to withstand a barrage of pressure as Erik Cikos headed off his own goal-line and Mulraney and Polworth went close. Ross County manager Jim McIntyre: \"Right from the off we were at it. Liam's second goal is fit to grace any league in the world. \"Today we put our chances away. You need to be good in both boxes to win football matches.\" Goalkeeper Scott Fox: \"The ball's in the box and just before Andrew Davies makes the block the whistle goes. I think he was saying it was offside. He made the wrong decision and admitted that to us which is a positive. \"I think I'm saving the shot as well I'm going a little more hard towards the ball. He's admitted he was wrong.\" Inverness CT manager Ritchie Foran: \"Defending. Poor defending. Switching off simple as that. We work hard on it as well. There's no excuses for it. I'll take my part of the blame they'll take their part. \"Boyce was the difference besides his goals his defending for Ross County was exceptional. He started them off, he was the difference. \"He's got hearts, desire, he's got hunger on and off the ball his work rate is immense. He bullied our boys today.

MEP Steven Woolfe, who had been seen as the frontrunner, quit the party on Monday. He had been hospitalised after a \"scuffle\" with fellow MEP Mike Hookem. Speaking to the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme, Mr Coburn denied Mr Woolfe's claim that UKIP was in a \"death spiral\" and had become ungovernable. He said the incident between Mr Woolfe and Mr Hookem had been \"regrettable\" but had involved only two people rather than the whole party. Mr Woolfe has stood by his claim that he \"received a blow\" from Mr Hookem, though this has been denied by Mr Hookem. Mr Coburn said: \"I keep saying it is country, party and self last. It is ideas that count, not individuals. What we are looking for is an agenda for the future, we are publishing it now and that is how we are moving forward. \"Can I lead the party? Well, if I were asked by colleagues then of course I would do my best. But the thing is it is not about who is governing, it is to do with getting a group of people together, a collegiate group of people, who are going to run the thing.\" Mr Coburn said the party's libertarian politics meant people \"can't be told what to do\" but called on party members to \"govern their own emotions and govern their own behaviour\". He added: \"What has happened is that we have had a charismatic leader for many years, who has kept a lid on things. \"Now what you have got is you've got to choose a new leader. In that, you've lifted the lid off things a bit and it bubbles over.\" Mr Coburn, who is UKIP's only elected representative in Scotland, insisted there was still a reason for the party to exist despite achieving its core aim of having the UK leave the EU. He said he wanted to ensure the country was run \"in the interests of the people not in the interests of big business or trade unions\" and that he had joined UKIP because he wanted \"radical change\" to the way the country was governed, not just because he wanted to leave the EU. And he said he would \"certainly not\" be supporting First Minister Nicola Sturgeon's attempts to keep Scotland in the EU single market after Brexit. Mr Coburn insisted: \"We decided during the Scottish referendum on independence that we are part of the United Kingdom and in terms of that we voted in the European referendum, that was as a United Kingdom. \"We entered as a United Kingdom, we leave as a United Kingdom. We voted as a United Kingdom, everybody knew that beforehand.\" Nominations to replace Ms James as UKIP leader close on 31 October, with the new leader announced on 28 November.", "As first reported by The Express, the settled community in the Hovefields area of Wickford reported hardcore-laden lorries arrive at the weekend. The lorries were followed by large mobile homes. Basildon Council said it is aware of \"an alleged breach of planning laws\". Essex Police has also been informed. The Hovefield site - which is subject to a High Court injunction preventing further development - is less than three miles (5km) by road - from the Dale Farm traveller site in Wickford. Dale Farm was Europe's largest traveller site before about 80 families were evicted from unlawful plots in 2011. Jill Walsh, of the Hovefields Residents Association, said an English Traveller family in five caravans left the site on Friday. After they departed, she said, a number of large lorries carrying concrete, hardcore and three mobile homes drove down Hovefields Avenue and onto the five acre field at the end of the road. Mrs Walsh said because of the narrowness of the road one of their neighbours - an elderly couple - had their fence ripped out and shrubbery damaged so that the lorries could get through. \"If the council does not prosecute over this and deal with the situation urgently they will have a Dale Farm II, but bigger.\" Phil Turner, leader of Basildon Council, said: \"Basildon Council is aware of an alleged breach of planning laws in the Hovefields area. \"We share the frustrations of residents, but the council does not have powers of arrest and must follow the proper legal process. \"As a public body, we must act within the existing legal framework, as set out by Parliament, and this adds considerable time and cost in dealing with such situations. \"However, residents can be assured that the council is taking all appropriate steps to deal with unauthorised development.\" Essex Police said it was investigating a criminal damage report involving the fence and has urged any witnesses to contact them. A police spokesman said: \"Essex Police is aware of an unauthorised traveller development on land near Hovefields Avenue. \"We are liaising with the local authority and will continue to monitor the situation.\"", "The Welsh county won three of 16 games in the County Championship Division Two last season and failed to make progress in the limited overs competitions. Mott is in the third and final year of contract as Glamorgan's head of elite performance. \"You do feel in the third year that you should see the fruits of your labour,\" said Mott. \"We have built a squad over the last couple of years and this is the year where we should be looking to improve a helluva lot. \"Last year, we made some improvements towards the back end, but it was too little, too late. \"This month of April is very important for everyone at the club and in Wales. We have to start to show what we have got.\" Glamorgan lost James Harris, who is one of four uncapped players in England's ICC Champions Trophy provisional squad, after he agreed to join Middlesex on a three-year contract at the end of last season. Veteran Robert Croft also retired after 23 seasons with the Welsh county. Seam bowler Harris triggered a clause in his contract that allowed him to leave Glamorgan, who gave him his first-class debut as a 16-year-old in 2007, if the Welsh county were not in the top tier. Mott has returned from a 10-day pre-season tour of South Africa with Glamorgan and is convinced his squad are ready to learn the lessons of  last seasons's disappointing campaign. \"We need to improve across the board,\" said Mott. \"A realistic goal is to win more games than we lose and we didn't get close to that last year. \"If we get close to that, just like any side in this division, it can come down to the last couple of games and you are challenging, but we have to start the season better. \"We finished well last season but our start really killed us and our promotion aspirations.\" Glamorgan have added Australian bowler Michael Hogan and Zimbabwean batsman Murray Goodwin to their squad this year. Australian Marcus North is to lead the one-day side, while his countryman, pace bowler Dirk Nannes, has been signed to play in the Friends Life T20.

Tidal Lagoon Power (TLP) said the claims had no \"clear scientific basis\". NRW said its figures were based on the \"best available evidence\" it received. In a briefing note sent to AMs and seen by BBC Wales, TLP disputed NRW's figures and claimed that the regulator refused to share its methodology for calculating them. \"Without clear scientific basis NRW has recently published figures based in these 'what if' scenarios despite our request to consider the evidence needed to back them up prior to publication,\" the briefing said. \"These scenarios give unrealistic and grossly misleading impact figures [on fish],\" the briefing adds. TLP said that computer modelling carried out by experts on its behalf estimated a \"worst case scenario\" of the lagoon killing 2% of all species of fish. The \u00c2\u00a31.3bn Swansea tidal lagoon project is being viewed by the firm as a test bed for much larger and more cost effective versions around the coast, including Cardiff, Newport and Colwyn Bay. UK government ministers are considering the findings of a six-month review of the viability of the scheme, which is yet to be published. Wales' Environment Secretary Lesley Griffiths said the Welsh Government was \"very supportive\" of the scheme. But she said both it and the industry needed clarity on the UK government's position in the \"very, very near future.\" NRW said it strongly disagreed with TLP's criticism, which it was \"very surprised and disappointed by\". Gareth O'Shea, an NRW executive director, said: \"We have received a vast amount of evidence on this subject from the applicant and have held detailed discussions with the developer for a year-and-a-half where we have shared a huge amount of information, data and our methodology. \"This has been assessed by independent experts and our own technical experts, and we have the utmost confidence that it is the best evidence available to enable us to make the right decision for the environment in Wales, as we are legally bound to do.\"", "The money will be used to create 35 new posts across Northern Ireland in an effort to speed diagnosis and cut waiting lists.

He told Radio Ulster's Sunday News that the extra cash should help match pace with demand. \"The impact of the additional money should be felt very quickly,\" Mr Hamilton said. \"We are going to create about seven posts in each of the five health trusts across Northern Ireland to supplement the hardworking teams that are already there doing a great job and to give them much needed resources to be able to carry out the diagnoses.\" Mr Hamilton said waiting lists resulted from \"huge pressure\" on the system.", "Ian Domingo, from Dumfries, had been in London for a ceremony to mark the 100th anniversary of the campaign in which his grandfather was killed. His suitbag, containing badges commemorating service, was taken from the Virgin service from Euston. Elaine Higgins, from Barrow-in-Furness, had picked up his bag by accident. She had attended the same remembrance ceremony and had travelled back in the same carriage as Mr Domingo but had unwittingly taken the wrong suitbag and simply put it back in her wardrobe. Mr Domingo contacted British Transport Police (BTP) to report it missing and an appeal was launched to track down the missing bag. Ms Higgins was tipped off by friends about the missing suit and badges adding she was left \"dumbstruck\" upon looking in her wardrobe. Her 18-year-old son Aled Jones was killed in Bosnia in 1996 and she had been attending the remembrance ceremony as part of her involvement with the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Families Association (SSAFA ) Bereaved Families Support Group. She said: \"I immediately felt for Mr Domingo as I had been wearing Aled's medals at the ceremony but took them off my suit - I knew what it would have felt like. \"I was dumbstruck for a moment when I unzipped the bag and then went to tell my husband we had Mr Domingo's suit. \"I was mortified for him, especially as I knew it had the medals on. \"We'd just picked it up and put it straight in the wardrobe, not even thinking to check the contents.\" She added that she felt obliged to meet Mr Domingo in person to \"apologise\" adding \"we can laugh about it now they're reunited but it must have been awful for him thinking he might not see it, or the badges, again\". The pair both praised the work of BTP and the lengths investigating officer PC Gez Cooper went to to have the suit returned. Mr Domingo said: \"I knew straight away from speaking to PC Cooper that he would leave no stone unturned trying to find my suit.

This allows the cells to travel to other areas of the body. The researchers said their findings could help prevent the spread of lung cancer. Writing in the Journal of Clinical Investigation, researchers from York and the University of Texas describe how the communications centre of a cell - known as the Golgi apparatus - receives a signal from proteins which prompts the movement of membrane sacks inside it. This movement alters the shape and surface of the cancer cell, allowing it to break free from its moorings and move around freely. Dr Daniel Ungar, from the University of York's biology department, said it was apt to think of the cancer cell resembling a tent structure. \"It has fixed sides to hold its shape and is firmly anchored to the ground in order to secure its contents. \"In order to move the tent, we have to rearrange its contents and collapse its sides in order to lift it out of its anchored position and carry it away,\" he said. He added that a similar process happens with cancer when it spreads - its outer edges are altered leaving it unanchored. The study found that a protein called Zeb1 was critical to this process and the research team now want to look at how to target the protein without damaging healthy cells, in which the protein also exists. The researchers only looked at lung cancer cells and do not know if the same process occurs in other cancers.", "Andrew Travers left the authority by \"mutual agreement\" after the error, officials said. Voters were initially turned away from all 155 polling stations in the borough because their names were missing from the poll list. An independent investigation has been launched, the council said. In a statement issued through the council, Mr Travers said: \"I have enjoyed my time at Barnet and I believe the changes we have put in place and the continued programme of growth and transformation will enable the borough to continue to thrive.\" A council spokesperson said Mr Travers had \"made a valuable contribution to the council during his three and half years as chief executive.\" Deputy chief executive John Hooton will take over temporarily while longer term arrangements are put in place, the council said. On election day, staff at one station said just three of the first 30 voters to show up were on the register. The rest were told to come back later. Barnet Council apologised for the problems and later offered emergency proxy votes to residents who had been affected. But voters in the area questioned how the result could be \"fair\" when not everyone was able to have their say at the ballot box. A statement released by Mr Travers on Thursday blamed electoral registration lists for the problems. The council's review will conclude by the end of May and the findings will be presented publicly to the General Functions Committee. It will look at the \"appropriateness\" of arrangements in place for the EU Referendum in June. A spokesman said it was currently in discussions to establish who would lead the investigation.", "For the second week in a row the outcome hinged on the final kick, with Lions full-back Leigh Halfpenny falling short with a penalty from halfway. The Welshman's five penalties had seen the Lions lead 15-9 until five minutes from time. But Wallabies centre Adam Ashley-Cooper crashed over for the only try, and Christian Leali'ifano held his nerve to land the conversion. It was another riveting conclusion to a tourniquet-tight contest, but the Lions' hopes of a first series win in 16 years now hang in the balance. Australia showed tremendous courage to pull the game out of the fire, and it is they rather than the Lions who will now head to Sydney with momentum. The Lions, who saw captain Sam Warburton hobble off with 13 minutes left, defended heroically at times, but must now regroup for a final throw of the dice in Sydney. Four first-half penalties from Halfpenny, to three from Leali'ifano, nudged the Lions into a 12-9 interval lead in front of a record Etihad Stadium crowd of 56,771. Brian O'Driscoll's tackle on Ashley-Cooper in midfield forced the Wallabies to concede the first of eight first-half penalties. Halfpenny's 48-metre kick missed by the narrowest of margins, coming back off the cross-bar, but thereafter the Welshman was in his usual immaculate form. Penalties in the ninth, 27th, 33rd and 40th minutes saw the Lions edge a cagey first half in which neither side was able to exercise authority for any extended period. The Lions appeared to have the edge at the breakdown, Australia conceding four penalties inside the opening eight minutes to earn an early warning from referee Craig Joubert. Halfpenny landed his first kick after the Lions drove a line-out and the Wallabies took down the maul. But after a composed start, errors starting to creep into the tourists' game, with the scrum a cause for concern. (provided by Opta Sports) Joubert awarded a free-kick against scrum-half Ben Youngs for not getting the ball in quickly enough, before loose-head Mako Vunipola was twice penalised for collapsing. Leali'ifano, knocked out in the first minute in Brisbane but fit to take over the kicking duties this week, landed both shots at goal to edge the hosts in front. A knock-on as he over-stretched for a pass completed a miserable 10 minutes for Vunipola, but he responded well. First, opposite number Ben Alexander was penalised for incorrect binding, then the Lions drove the Wallabies backwards at the next scrum to earn another. Halfpenny landed two confident blows with the boot to nudge the Lions back in front. Leali'ifano levelled matters again when Dan Lydiate fell offside trying to stem a dangerous Wallabies counter-attack. But the Lions twice benefited from hoisting up high kicks as the interval approached, the second falling to George North, with Jonny Sexton maintaining the momentum through a half-break. When Ben Mowen was penalised at the ensuing breakdown, Halfpenny's fourth penalty gave the Lions a slender half-time lead. Australia threw everything at the Lions in a tense and scoreless third quarter, but their defence - led by the obdurate Lydiate - initially held firm. There were nervous moments aplenty and further frustrations at the scrum. The Lions lost one against the head after Youngs delayed the put-in, while O'Driscoll's pass straight to Folau allowed Australia to counter dangerously, before the Irish centre was penalised for hands in a ruck. The Lions sent on Conor Murray for Youngs at scrum-half, and the Irishman immediately helped win a relieving penalty over the ball as Australia built up a head of steam. Media playback is not supported on this device North had precious few opportunities with ball in hand, but he caught a pass and proceeded to pick up Folau and drive him backwards to galvanise his side. When they sent the Wallabies back-pedalling again at the next scrum, Halfpenny's fifth penalty in the 63rd minute stretched the lead to six points for the first time. The strains of \"Swing Low, Swing Chariot\" - a demonstration of four-nation unity among the legions of red - echoed around the cavernous arena, but Australia were not done yet. The dangerous Folau, stepping off his wing, was twice denied before the pressure finally told with five minutes left, O'Connor sending Ashley-Cooper crashing over. Leali'ifano nailed the conversion, but the Lions still had a line-out to save themselves with two minutes left. However, replacement hooker Richard Hibbard could not find his target. With time up on the stadium clock, the Lions ran a penalty from their own half and got to halfway, where Australia conceded a penalty. But Halfpenny's kick fell agonisingly short.

Turkey is part of the US-led coalition against IS, and coalition planes use its air base at Incirlik for raids in Iraq and Syria. Turkey is also conducting a campaign against Kurdish militants. How dangerous is Turkey's unrest? Tears and destruction amid PKK crackdown Turkey in midst of hideous vortex A ceasefire between the government and the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) broke down last year. On Saturday an emergency travel warning was published on the website of the US embassy in Turkey. \"There are credible threats to tourist areas, in particular to public squares and docks in Istanbul and Antalya. Please exercise extreme caution if you are in the vicinity of such areas,\" it read. Antalya, on Turkey's Mediterranean coast, is a major tourist centre visited by millions of people every year. The warning comes a day after Israel's counterterrorism bureau urged all Israelis to avoid Turkey, saying: \"There are immediate risks of attacks being carried out in the country, and we stress the threat applies to all tourism sites in Turkey.\"", "\"Trust in the values of our people and in our ability to rebuild the economy,\" Mr Temer said. He has named a business-friendly cabinet that includes respected former central bank chief Henrique Meirelles as finance minster. Ms Rousseff denounced her removal as a \"farce\" and \"sabotage\". Mr Temer was the leftist Ms Rousseff's vice-president before withdrawing his party's support in March. She has accused him of involvement in a \"coup\". After Wednesday's all-night session that lasted more than 20 hours, senators voted by 55 votes to 22 to suspend her and put her on trial for budgetary violations. In her final speech on Thursday afternoon, she again denied the allegations and vowed to fight what she called an \"injustice\" by all legal means. Mr Temer, 75, has now taken over as president for up to 180 days - the maximum time allowed for the impeachment trial of Ms Rousseff, 68. He said: \"It is urgent to restore peace and unite Brazil. We must form a government that will save the nation.\" Stressing that \"economic vitality\" was his key task, he added: \"It is essential to rebuild the credibility of the country at home and abroad to attract new investments and get the economy growing again.\" But he also said Brazil was still a poor nation and that he would protect and expand social programmes. \"Let's stop talking about crisis. Let's work instead,\" he said. Michel Temer became interim president as soon as Ms Rousseff was suspended. Read more on Michel Temer here Michel Temer also said he would support the sweeping investigation into corruption at state oil company Petrobras that has embroiled many politicians and officials. Mr Temer has nominated a 22-strong cabinet. There are no women, although two more names are expected to be added to the cabinet. Ms Rousseff had earlier suggested that sexism in the male-dominated Congress had played a key part in the impeachment process. Mr Meirelles, the new finance minister, built a reputation for calming nerves in the markets when heading the central bank, and helped tame inflation to create one of the country's biggest economic booms. But analysts say Mr Temer's popularity ratings are as bad as Ms Rousseff's and he faces many challenges. During the overnight debate, Senator Jose Serra, who has been named the new foreign minister, said the impeachment process was \"a bitter though necessary medicine\". \"Having the Rousseff government continue would be a bigger tragedy,\" he said. Brazil is suffering from its worst recession in 10 years, unemployment reached 9% in 2015 and inflation is at a 12-year high. In her TV speech, flanked by ministers at the presidential palace, Ms Rousseff said that she may have made mistakes but had committed no crimes, adding: \"I did not violate budgetary laws.\" She said: \"What is at stake is respect for the ballot box, the sovereign will of the Brazilian people and the constitution.\" Branding the process \"fraudulent\" and saying her government was \"undergoing sabotage\", she vowed to fight the charges against her and said she was confident she would be found innocent. Her removal ends 13 years of leftist rule. The 180 days allocated for the trial to take place expire on 8 November.", "North Wales Police and Crime Commissioner Arfon Jones said a so-called \"fix room\" could reduce drug deaths and the spread of infection. He said the proposed plan came in response to Rhosddu residents' concerns over dumped hypodermic needles. Mr Jones' comments come after a similar facility was recently announced for Glasgow. The Glasgow centre, which will be the first of its kind in the UK, will aim to address the problems caused by users who inject on the city's streets. Similar schemes already operate in 10 other countries, including Australia, Germany, France, Holland and Switzerland. Mr Jones said: \"At the moment, all you're getting is the authorities treating the symptoms of substance abuse and drug addiction rather than the underlying causes. \"Drug addiction should be treated as a public health issue rather than as a criminal matter.\" If given the go-ahead, he said the rooms could also offer \"wrap around\" services such as health care, counselling, housing and welfare advice. He said he also wanted to see a heroin-assisted treatment centre, which would see \"chaotic\" addicts prescribed medicinal heroin to help them beat their addiction. He added this would also help tackle low-level street drug dealing. Mr Jones said he was in discussion with members of Wrexham council about how such a project could work. He added: \"This approach would be better for those suffering from the blight of addiction, society in general and the residents of Rhosddu in particular. \"The people who make a good living out of drugs are the organised criminals.

The rebels in the Luhansk region said they were withdrawing tanks. Both sides have committed to pulling out materiel carrying weapons with less than 100mm (4in) calibre. The rebels in the Donetsk region were quoted as saying that they would start pulling out their weapons on 18 October. The withdrawal process is yet to be verified by international monitors from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). The pullout date was announced at a meeting of leaders from Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany on Friday. Moscow denies sending troops and heavy weapons to the pro-Russian separatists. However, the Kremlin admits that Russian \"volunteers\" are fighting alongside the rebels in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. In a separate development, OSCE monitors said in a statement on Friday they spotted the powerful TOS-1 Buratino multiple rocket launcher in Luhansk. A spokesman for the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) to Ukraine told the BBC the discovery was particularly significant because of the damage the rockets could cause. The rebels have not commented on the OSCE report. Ukraine crisis: Russia tests new weapons Ukraine 'can't stop Russian armour' In Paris, Russian President Vladimir Putin met Ukraine's Petro Poroshenko, France's Francois Hollande and German Chancellor Angela Merkel for the first time since they agreed a peace deal for Ukraine in Minsk in February. The so-called Normandy Four meeting assessed all elements of the deal, including the staging of local elections in the rebel-held regions and the withdrawal of heavy weapons from the line of contact. After the meeting, Mr Hollande said the pullout would start on Saturday, with Mr Poroshenko later confirming this in a statement (in Ukrainian). Mr Poroshenko said this process would then continue in stages and should be completed within 41 days. He said the 100m calibre pullout would include not just artillery pieces \"but also tanks and mortars\". Regarding the elections in the rebel-held areas, the French leader said they must be held according to Ukrainian law, as envisaged in the Minsk peace deal. Mr Poroshenko said the four leaders had supported the idea of the elections based exclusively on Ukrainian legislation and in the presence of OSCE observers, who should be granted full access. However, the rebels said before the Paris talks that they still intended to proceed with staging local elections on their terms. Kiev says such elections - to be held on different dates from the rest of Ukraine and not according to Ukrainian law - would be \"fake\". A ceasefire in eastern Ukraine has been holding since September, although there have been reports of occasional shelling.

Debris from Karam's car hit ex-Formula 1 driver Wilson, 37, and the Andretti Autosport driver crashed into a wall. IndyCar officials said his death was a \"monumentally sad day\". Mark Miles, chief executive of IndyCar parent company Hulman & Co, said: \"Justin's elite ability to drive a race car was matched by his unwavering kindness, character and humility - which is what made him one of the most respected members of the paddock. \"As we know, the racing industry is one big family, and our efforts moving forward will be focused on rallying around Justin's family to ensure they get the support they need during this unbelievably difficult time.\" A seven-time IndyCar race winner, Wilson, from Sheffield, is survived by his wife, Julia, and two daughters. In a statement his family said he was a \"loving father and devoted husband, as well as a highly competitive racing driver who was respected by his peers\". His brother Stefan, also a racing driver, paid tribute on social media, saying: \"Can't even begin to describe the loss I feel right now. He was my brother, my best friend, my role model and mentor. He was a champion. \"He lived for this sport, he loved it. The only comfort I feel is that he lived a life he loved.\" An Andretti Autosport team statement said: \"He was a tremendous racer, a valuable member of the team and respected representative to our sport. While Justin was only part of the Andretti line-up for a short time, it only took a second for him to forever become part of the Andretti family. \"His life and racing career is a story of class and passion surpassed by none.\" Wilson was making his 174th IndyCar start in Sunday's race, but his major motorsport breakthrough came in F1. He won the Formula 3000 series in 2001, and two years later raised \u00a31.2m to finance his F1 entry after setting up a company in his own name. Standing at 6ft 4in, Wilson was unusually tall for F1 - drivers over six feet are a rarity - and he scored his only point from 16 races with Minardi and Jaguar during 2003 at the United States Grand Prix. He moved to the United States in 2004 and enjoyed greater success in Champ Car, finishing as series runner-up in 2006 and 2007 before switching to IndyCar racing in 2008, after Champ Car merged with the Indy Racing League. He finished second in the previous IndyCar race in Mid-Ohio on 2 August, his first podium finish since 2013, while his final victory came at the Firestone 550 at Texas Motor Speedway in June 2012. His appearance at the triangle-shaped Pocono Raceway was only his sixth of this season as he struggled to find a full-time seat. In the past 20 years there have been seven deaths during race meetings in IndyCar, including in the series' previous incarnations as Champ Car and Indy Racing League. In that time one F1 driver has been killed - Wilson's death comes 38 days after Frenchman Jules Bianchi succumbed to the devastating injuries he sustained at last year's Japanese Grand Prix. Four years ago British driver and two-time Indianapolis 500 winner Dan Wheldon lost his life aged 33 at the Las Vegas Indy 300. Wheldon was killed when his head hit a post in the fence at Las Vegas Motor Speedway after a crash involving 15 vehicles. His death triggered calls for further safety reviews, including suggestions that open-wheel racing be banned on high-speed, oval tracks, where tightly-packed cars reach speeds of 230mph. IndyCar officials have introduced several safety measures into the sport. This includes safer walls, collapsible barriers designed to cushion impact and the installation of trauma centres at race tracks. McLaren driver Jenson Button is one of many Formula 1 figures to have paid tribute to Wilson. \"I raced with Justin as far back as 1989 in karting and remember his smile was infectious,\" he tweeted. \"The motorsport world comes to a standstill once again. Justin Wilson was a great person and racing driver. My thoughts are with his family.\" World champion Lewis Hamilton wrote on Instagram: \"I am so devastated to hear of another passing of a great man and driver. I'd met Justin Wilson a few times growing up and he was the ultimate gentleman. Whilst I only knew him a little, I will miss him. We will miss him.\" Speaking on BBC Radio 5 live, former Minardi owner Paul Stoddart, who gave Wilson his first start in F1,said: \"Motorsport has lost not just a fantastic driver but one of the true gentleman of the sport. \"Justin wasn't just a very fast and capable driver but a true gentleman and one of the nicest guys you could ever hope to meet in the paddock.\" Scotland's four-time IndyCar champion Dario Franchitti said: \"Rest in peace Justin, it was a real privilege to know you and call you a friend.\" Nine-time F1 winner Mark Webber, who competed alongside Wilson at Minardi in 2003, tweeted: \"Last night a very good man left us. So sorry. RIP Justin. My thoughts are with your loved ones.\" Sage Karam, who was leading the race at the time of the crash, has been released from hospital after treatment for heel and wrist injuries. \"I can't find the proper words to describe the pain and sympathy I feel for Justin and his family,\" he said on social media.", "He had been making his way down the south ridge of 3,000ft-high Tryfan when he slipped on Saturday afternoon. An RAF Sea King helicopter, based at Valley in Anglesey, was called at 15:00 BST to help him back down the mountain. The man, in his early 50s, was flown to the Ogwen Valley mountain rescue team base after it was determined he did not need hospital treatment.", "From next season, the Championship winners will go up automatically if they meet 'minimum standard criteria'. Jersey and Yorkshire Carnegie are among clubs that are in favour of the change. \"I hope it doesn't lead to the Championship becoming a non-entity,\" said Pirates chairman Paul Durkin. \"If you're relegated from the Premiership you're put in the naughty boys corner, which is in the Championship, for a year and expected to come back up. \"That's what it feels like to us, the way that it's going - it takes away from the competition, I think.\" As part of the new agreement between the Rugby Football Union and Premiership Rugby, Championship clubs will be given increased funding. Durkin told BBC Radio Cornwall that second-tier sides will share \u00a32.7m between them over three years, but relegated Premiership sides will receive a parachute payment of \"over \u00a33m\". \"While first past the post is a good idea, and I would be in favour of that if there was a level playing field, this is not a level playing field,\" he continued. The majority of Championship sides, including Jersey Reds, are not eligible for promotion, as they lack the required ground facilities. \"You've got London Irish sitting top of the Championship, 15 points ahead of Yorkshire Carnegie - they're undefeated,\" Reds chairman Mark Morgan told BBC Radio Jersey. \"It would be very unfair to get to the end of the season and, just because they have one bad game in a knock-out situation, they don't go to the Premiership.\" The 2015-16 Championship play-off final was held on 25 May, with the new Premiership campaign starting 100 days later. \"To be in the middle of May recruiting for a new season that is just two or three months away is impossible - and we can see the result that's had on Bristol,\" Morgan added. \"Although they would not say that they have ring fenced the Premiership, to all intents and purposes on a financial basis that's really what's happened.\" Yorkshire Carnegie were in the top flight as recently as 2011 - they are now second in the Championship, which will put them in the promotion play-offs this term but count for nothing from next season. Although scrapping the play-offs could arguably make it more difficult for them to go up, executive president Sir Ian McGeechan, the former British & Irish Lions coach, supports the RFU change. \"Having been part the play-off system for a number of years, I am pleased to see the return of the first-past-the-post system,\" he said. \"The decision to make this announcement now is particularly welcome for all the clubs and allows the Championship sides the opportunity to get their financial and personnel planning in place for 2017-18 at the right time of year.\" The Championship play-offs were introduced for the 2009-10 campaign, with Exeter Chiefs the side to gain promotion despite finishing second in the regular season. Bristol - the side Exeter defeated in the final - have been the side most affected by the play-offs, finishing top of the league on five occasions before finally reaching the Premiership last year. \"Most people would probably say [scrapping play-offs] benefits the Premiership - I wouldn't disagree with that,\" Exeter head coach Rob Baxter told BBC Radio Devon. \"It'll be a tougher scenario and a different management situation for the regular Championship clubs, because they can't focus on seeing if they can create some moments in a final. \"They now have to create a good pre-season that builds a good start to the season, because they'll need to be up and challenging from day one.\"", "Let's call it Alice in Financial Wonderland. On Thursday the European Central Bank took additional steps to stimulate the eurozone economy, including a further cut in an interest rate that is already below zero. Why is this so odd? Think about what interest is. The lender gets paid interest for allowing someone else to use their money. But when the rate goes below zero the relationship is turned on its head. The lender is now paying the borrower. Why would anyone do that? Some reasons below. Of course, this situation only applies to a limited number of financial relationships. No-one will pay you to spend on your credit card. But this unusual state of affairs does exist. The ECB's deposit rate, which applies to money parked overnight by commercial banks, is now minus 0.4%. Does that make the ECB president Mario Draghi the white rabbit - the one who led Alice into Lewis Carroll's subterranean fantasy world? Or perhaps there is a whole family with fluffy tails whose warrens extend to the central banks of Japan and several European countries, which have similar policies. These negative rates are the policy decisions taken by a handful of central banks. But the phenomenon has also affected the bond market, where investors buy and sell the bonds or debts of governments and large companies. The cost of borrowing is set when the bonds are issued. It depends on how much the financial firms who buy the bonds pay for them - what they are buying is a promise to make a series of payments in the future. If the price is high enough, the borrowing cost, in effect the interest rate, can be zero or even negative. Last week the bond market took a new step down the financial rabbit hole. Japan is the first government among the G20 major economies to borrow money by issuing bonds for 10 years at an interest rate of less than zero. It's true that several other countries have done it for shorter periods and Switzerland (which is not a G20 member) has already done it for 10-year borrowing. But Japan being paid to borrow money for 10 years is nonetheless a remarkable development. It's a much bigger economy than Switzerland, with a much larger government debt - much larger even in relation to its economy. The usual pattern with borrowing costs is the longer you borrow for the more you have to pay. So a negative 10-year cost is a striking thing. It's worth emphasising the distinction between the two contexts in which we have negative rates. One is central banks making a judgement about what is best for economic growth employment and inflation. The other is private investors accepting a negative return on an asset, which is arguably much the stranger of the two. So why do they? Accepting a pitifully low positive rate is one thing: it is better than nothing. But if the rate on offer is negative, then zero, or just sitting on the cash looks preferable. With the latest government debt sale in Japan, one reason is thought to be investors buying the bonds with a view to selling them later when the central bank goes into the market as part of its quantitative easing programme, which involves buying financial assets with newly created money. In other cases, banks have been more willing to buy bonds with negative returns because they are charged by the central bank if they deposit excess funds. In some cases, foreign investors think they can make money if the currency rises enough to compensate for the negative yield. With central banks in the developed economies it is a policy choice to have kept their official interest rates very low - below zero in a few cases. One of the key reasons is something else that is also very strange - at least by the standards of the relatively recent past. Inflation, in the judgement of central banks in the main developed economies, is too low. At times it too has been below zero, but in the US, Japan, the eurozone and the UK even when above zero it has been well below the central banks' targets of 2% or thereabouts. Central banks' failure to get back to the target and the persistence of sluggish economic growth in the eurozone and Japan has led them to try increasingly unorthodox policies: quantitative easing and negative interest rates. The underlying idea is much the same as cutting interest rates in more normal times. The aim is to encourage more borrowing and spending by firms and households. Central bank rates do not completely determine the cost of such borrowing, but they are a major factor. Or at least they usually are. There are some concerns that when central bank rates go negative, they have less impact on lending rates in the private sector beyond the money markets. A review by economists at the Bank for International Settlements said: \"Questions remain as to whether negative policy rates are transmitted to the wider economy through lower lending rates for firms and households.\" There are also concerns that they make it harder for banks to lend profitably. The obvious alternative is fiscal policy - government spending and taxes. But governments in the west have been reluctant to use this approach, due to concerns about increasing government debt, although critics say those worries are misplaced. So how long before we emerge from Financial Wonderland? There was a period last year when there were some signs that things might be starting to return to normal. The clearest indication of that was the decision by the Federal Reserve in December to raise US interest rates from essentially zero. The expectation then was there would be several more hikes this year. However, this glimmer of financial normality - signs of Alice the banker regaining consciousness perhaps - didn't last. Now the markets think it is more likely that the Fed will raise rates again just once or twice this year. The prospect of any such action by the other major central banks has receded into the more distant future. More than seven years on from the most intense phase of the financial crisis, the aftermath is still with us. Some things clearly have improved. Unemployment is low in the US, Britain, and Germany and the eurozone is no longer in imminent danger of chaotic disintegration. But there are many weaknesses and the unusual financial conditions will not return to normal for a while. It's getting to feel like Alice's tea party, with the clock stopped at tea time. She certainly hasn't come round yet.", "The Nottinghamshire golfer partnered Masters champion Danny Willett on the Sunday at Augusta, then Dustin Johnson on the final day of the US Open at Oakmont. \"I hadn't had those feelings for a while, that buzz and that rush of adrenaline,\" Westwood said. \"It was great to get them back, even if it ended in disappointment.\" The 43-year-old stands 39th in the world rankings. He has done well on both previous trips to Troon, finishing tied 10th in 1997 and fourth in 2004, while he came third just down the Ayrshire coast at Turnberry in 2009. The bookmakers see it differently, rating him a lot higher. He is the 12th shortest price on offer at 40-1, shorter than not only Willett but also four comparatively recent former Open winners - defending champion Zach Johnson, Ernie Els (2002 and 2012) Louis Oosthuizen (2010) and Padraig Harrington (2007 and 2008). \"I feel like I'm back to the stage where I turn up fully expecting to play well, a bit like the way when I was winning for fun a few years back,\" said Westwood. Find out how to get into golf with our special guide. \"That's down to the way I'm swinging a club, and the way I am mentally. Hiding in a darkened room and cursing my luck is never going to be my style. \"After putting myself in the frame in both majors this year, I'm sure I'll be a bit more relaxed if I can get in the mix at Troon. \"I've been through so many ups and downs now that nothing's ever going to faze me, and I really like the course.\" The former world number one continued: \"I had a great weekend in 2004 when I finished 67-68 and holed a really long putt on the last on the Sunday from 35 feet. In fact, I've played well there both times the Open has been played there.\" Westwood has come close to victory so many times in major championships. His total of nine top-three finishes is comfortably the most of any golfer not to have won one of golf's big four events - the Masters, the US Open, the Open or the US PGA. And, on five occasions, he has had to stand by and watch mates from Chubby Chandler's same management team - Oosthuizen, Charl Schwartzel, Rory McIlroy, Darren Clarke and Willett - all win their first major. But, in three successive years, from 2011 to 2013, the Open was won by a fortysomething. Phil Mickelson was 43 when he won at Muirfield in 2013. Both Westwood's great friend Darren Clarke (at Sandwich in 2011) and Els (at Royal Lytham in 2012) were 42, while Mark O'Meara was 41 when he triumphed at Royal Birkdale in 1998. Like allowing a good claret time to mature, when it comes to finding the winner of a Claret Jug, turning 40 is clearly not the worst age to be. English golf's big hitters: Along with Westwood (39th), there are currently six other English players inside the world's top 50 all taking up their invites to Royal Troon - Yorkshiremen Willett (ninth) and Matthew Fitzpatrick (43rd), Hampshire's Justin Rose (11th), Bristol's Chris Wood (22nd), Cheltenham's Paul Casey (29th) and Nuneaton's Andy Sullivan (36th). The old-timers: Buckinghamshire's Luke Donald (15 Open appearances), Swindon's David Howell (13), Surrey's Ross Fisher (eight), Staffordshire's Robert Rock (seven) and London's Anthony Wall (six) have all been familiar figures at the Open over the past two decades. The under-exposed: London's James Morrison has only played twice, but has performed well each time (tied 23rd in 2012, tied 20th in 2015), while Southport's Tommy Fleetwood is out to better successive missed cuts in 2014 and 2015. Essex's Matt Southgate (2014) and London's Andrew Johnston (2011) both missed the cut in their one previous Open appearance. As for last week's Scottish Open runner-up Tyrrell Hatton, this will be a fifth Open in six years for the former Bucks, Berks & Oxon amateur - but the 24-year-old from Marlow, now up to 68th in the world, is yet to make the cut. The first-timers: As well as Hampshire amateur Scott Gregory, six English professionals will be making their Open debut - Lancashire's Jack Senior, London's James Heath, Merseyside's Paul Howard, Northamptonshire's Ryan Evans, Watford's Callum Shinkwin and Lincolnshire's Dave Coupland.

The 500 missions include rescues of hillwalkers and climbers and searches for missing people. The Inverness base is one of the UK's busiest search and rescue units.", "The US administration signalled heavy cuts to UN operations, in its budget proposals released on Tuesday. The US foots more than a quarter of the UN's $7.9bn (\u00c2\u00a36.1bn) peacekeeping bill. A spokesman for UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said the organisation was willing to discuss how peacekeeping could be made more cost-effective. Mr Trump's budget proposal declares new \"attention on the appropriate US share of international spending at the United Nations\". The document does not provide a detailed breakdown, but Reuters news agency reports the drop in funding for the operations could amount to $1bn. The spokesman said the UN was studying Mr Trump's plan. \"The figures presented would simply make it impossible for the UN to continue all of its essential work advancing peace, development, human rights and humanitarian assistance,\" he said. The BBC's Nick Bryant at the UN says such a warning from the organisation is unusually blunt. The US president does not set the budget, but makes recommendations to Congress. It is understood that the UN secretary general has been lobbying Congress members on the importance of international peacekeeping. The US provides 28.5% of the United Nations peacekeeping budget - almost three times as much as the next-highest contributor, China. While Mr Trump's plan does not include details, the US is known to want to cap its contributions to a maximum of 25%. There are currently 16 active peacekeeping operations, including Syria, South Sudan, and on the border of India and Pakistan.", "The crash happened at about 17:35 GMT. A woman was also injured in the crash, but her injuries are not believed to be life threatening. Police have appealed for anyone who witnessed the crash to come forward.", "Zeid Raad Al Hussein described the incident, in which 10 people were wounded, as \"extremely shocking\". Cizre has been the focus of an offensive by Turkey's army against the Kurdish rebel group, the PKK. Mr Al Hussein also expressed concern over reports that the man who filmed the incident was arrested. \"Filming an atrocity is not a crime but shooting unarmed civilians most certainly is,\" he said. \"It is essential that there is a thorough, independent, impartial investigation into this and any other events that have led to the wounding or killing of civilians.\" The incident in Cizre, a predominantly Kurdish city, occurred on 20 January. Video footage posted online purporting to be of the immediate aftermath of the shooting shows people being loaded into ambulances amid screaming and the sound of explosions. Reports suggested that the group who came under fire were attempting to rescue people wounded in an earlier clashes. The video footage also appears to show that some of the group were pushing a cart loaded with bodies across the street, watched by an armoured military vehicle. Mr Al Hussein, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, said the victims had been \"apparently cut down in a hail of gunfire\". The unrest came just days after security forces killed 20 Kurdish militants in clashes in nearby Diyarbakir, according to the Turkish military. Three Turkish soldiers also died in a rebel attack, the military said. The region has suffered its worst violence in two decades since a ceasefire between the Turkish government and the PKK collapsed in July. The PKK, which has fought for autonomy for Turkey's Kurdish minority for decades, has been attacking security forces, while the army has been besieging Kurdish-dominated towns. The Turkish Human Rights Foundation says at least 198 civilians, including 39 children, have died in areas under curfew since August. Since July, more than 200 Turkish soldiers and policemen have been killed in attacks by the PKK, which is listed as a terrorist organisation by Turkey, the EU and US. The European Union has called for an immediate ceasefire.", "Tuilagi, 23, is still recovering from the injury he suffered in October. Cockerill is confident Tuilagi will return in time to play at the World Cup for the national side, who came close to winning the Six Nations without him. \"He's improving all the time but the likelihood now is he may not play this season,\" he told BBC Radio 5 live. \"The likelihood is he will be fit for June and he'll join England for their World Cup camp. \"Hopefully he'll be involved in the World Cup warm-ups and have a huge say in how England do.\" Stuart Lancaster's tournament hosts get their World Cup campaign under way against Fiji at Twickenham on 18 September. Before that, they face warm-up fixtures against France in August, both home and away, before a final run-out against Ireland at Twickenham on 5 September. Samoa-born Tuilagi has won 25 caps and scored 11 tries for England, while also featuring once for the British and Irish Lions.

Elsie was stabbed to death in a tunnel beneath a railway line in Wakefield The BBC understands the arrested man is Peter Pickering, who was first questioned in connection with the murder in 2016. He was arrested near Newbury, in Berkshire. More stories from across Yorkshire The man is also being questioned in relation to an unconnected allegation of a rape and kidnap in 1972. Elsie was murdered as she walked home from her school's sailing club, close to the River Calder and the Calder and Hebble Canal. The West Yorkshire Police Homicide and Major Enquiries team re-opened its investigation into her death after a series of reports on BBC Radio 4. Mr Pickering was originally arrested in September before being bailed. Police said he had been re-arrested after fresh evidence was uncovered. The allegations of the 1972 rape and kidnap are understood to have emerged during the course of their investigation into Elsie's death.", "US prosecutors had been expressing their wish to put him on trial in a US court since his arrest in February 2014. Guzman, who was named Public Enemy Number One by the Chicago Crime Commission in 2013, has been indicted by at least seven federal district courts. As the head of the Sinaloa cartel, he is accused of overseeing the smuggling of huge amounts of drugs from South and Central America to the United States. He is also facing charges of money laundering, racketeering and arms trafficking in courts as far apart as Arizona and Texas. But since his 2014 arrest in his home state of Sinaloa, Mexico, there has been little movement on the extradition front. While US courts were arguing about who had the best case against Guzman and should therefore get priority putting him on trial, Mexican officials were making it clear they were in no rush to send him across the border. Mexico's attorney general at the time, Jesus Murillo Karam, said as early as April last year that he had \"no intention\" of handing Guzman over to the US authorities. In an interview with Mexican daily El Universal, Mr Murillo Karam said he was annoyed at a plea bargain an extradited Mexican drug dealer had struck with the US authorities. Jesus Vicente Zambada Niebla, also known as Vicentillo, pleaded guilty in a court in Chicago to smuggling tonnes of cocaine and heroin to the United States. In exchange for promising the US authorities \"full and truthful co-operation\", his sentence was reduced from a potential life sentence to 10 years. The US authorities believed Vicentillo could prove a key witness if Joaquin Guzman was ever extradited to the United States. The son of Guzman's number two, Ismael \"El Mayo\" Zambada, and a key player in the drugs trade himself, Vicentillo was seen as a valuable asset. But Mr Murillo Karam said he felt \"uncomfortable\" with the deals the US reached with \"criminals\" such as Vicentillo. The then-attorney general pointed out that there were plenty of charges Guzman faced in Mexico as well as in the US and that he wanted to see him tried in his homeland. He reiterated his position in January of this year, when he again stated that he wanted to see Guzman serve his sentence in Mexico first. 'El Chapo [Guzman] has to stay here to serve his sentence and then I'll extradite him. That could be in about 300 to 400 years, there's still a long time to go.\" At the time, he said that he thought a formal extradition request by the US was imminent, but it seems that following Mr Murillo Karam's strong words, the request was not filed. He argued that keeping Guzman in Mexico was also a question of sovereignty. But Mr Murillo Karam is more likely to regret another statement he made back in January. He said that extradition should be considered in instances where there was a flight risk, something he said did \"not exist\" in the case of Guzman. Given the fact the Guzman had escaped from another top security jail in 2001 and was on the run for the next 13 years, this was a surprising assurance. Comparisons have been drawn between Joaquin Guzman and the late infamous Colombian drug lord, Pablo Escobar. Both made immense fortunes in the illicit drug trafficking trade, and through bribery and intimidation managed to sway huge power and infiltrate parts of the security forces. Both have also mounted successful and spectacular escapes from jail. It was Pablo Escobar's jail break that played a major part in changing the Colombian approach to extradition. In a 1991 deal with the Colombian authorities, Escobar agreed to hand himself in to the Colombian police and to serve five years in a jail built to his own specifications in his hometown of Medellin. La Catedral (the cathedral), as the luxury jail was known, boasted a football pitch, a jacuzzi and a bar among its many amenities. After little more than a year, Escobar escaped from the jail and went on the run, much like Guzman did on Saturday. He was eventually killed a year later while still on the run. But before he was jailed, Escobar had threatened and cajoled members of a constitutional assembly to enshrine a ban on extraditions in the Colombian constitution. It remained in force until December 1997, when a constitutional amendment reversed the ban. Since then, Colombia has extradited many drug dealers to the United States saying that it is both a cheaper and safer option for the Colombian justice system. Colombian officials argue that in the US, Colombian drug dealers will find it harder to intimidate guards and their families or to access their riches to bribe prison staff. With 30 prison staff and the warden under questioning over the escape of Chapo Guzman at Mexico's Altiplano jail, this argument may well be met with more open ears in Mexico, too, now.", "It was always going to be a highly charged farewell, after 112 years, to this football bastion of east London and the one consolation was that at least no-one was seriously injured. This was a hugely significant fixture for the visitors too, Louis van Gaal and his players arriving with their fate in their own hands but little margin for error. They knew victory here, amid a heady mix of nostalgia and fierce hostility, would leave them needing only to beat Bournemouth at Old Trafford on Sunday to secure Champions League football. Instead, a 3-2 loss leaves them still needing that win against the Cherries - but now requiring that neighbours Manchester City lose at Swansea. Media playback is not supported on this device As a fleet of London taxis brought a succession of West Ham greats on to the Boleyn Ground turf for the big finish to the farewell party, several cynics suggested one cab was on order to ferry Van Gaal away from Manchester United. It has been obvious since Christmas that there has been no great appetite inside Old Trafford to replace Van Gaal - if United were certain he was not the man for the job, former Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho could have already been occupying his office or at least officially lined up. Even in the hours before this loss at West Ham, Van Gaal's position appeared to be gaining strength with the supposed loss of 18-year-old transfer target Renato Sanches to Bayern Munich in a \u00a327.6m deal. It was later suggested United had not missed out but that Van Gaal had actually vetoed the deal - and why would the club let him do that if he was not going to be in charge next season? The fact that Sanches' agent is Jorge Mendes, who would love to see his client Mourinho installed at Old Trafford, only added to the perceived political intrigue. Media playback is not supported on this device One way Van Gaal could have strengthened his position even further would have been a win at West Ham that would have made United firm favourites to beat City to fourth place in the Premier League, with the potential bonus of an FA Cup final victory over Crystal Palace in May. Indeed, so buoyed was Van Gaal by the sudden upturn in his position that he was even able to point out to the media that they were finally posing tactical questions before a game rather than asking about his possible sacking. And for four tantalising second-half minutes it all seemed on for Van Gaal. Antony Martial's brilliance had turned the game, undeservedly on its balance, in United's favour with two goals. At 2-1 up, they were 14 minutes from a win that could have offered the opportunity to put a different spin on their season. It was not to be. Old vulnerabilities quickly returned and saw United beaten by two headed goals from Michail Antonio and Winston Reid - leaving Van Gaal back on the rack. The players dragged their manager out of a hole then threw him back in again. The intention may still be to keep him next season but that decision would have been made a lot easier and more palatable with victory. Now it all goes on the line again on Sunday - but with Manchester City at the controls. The equation is simple. Manchester United must beat Bournemouth and hope Manchester City lose at Swansea - and therein lies that sliver of hope for the 64-year-old Dutch coach. City have been so unreliable, unpredictable and uninspired at times this season that you would not risk too much on the certainty of Manuel Pellegrini's side getting the job done. Of course City will be favourites and only need a point - but they are not a team to be trusted, as seen in their heavy defeat at Southampton and disappointing draw at home to Arsenal in their last two Premier League games. And after beating Liverpool 3-1 and, more impressively, thrashing West Ham 4-1 at Upton Park on Saturday, Swansea are also running into the sort of relaxed good form that makes them dangerous opponents. Confidence has been renewed to such an extent that head coach Francesco Guidolin is expected to be confirmed on a new contract after a Swansea board meeting on Wednesday. City can be fragile and United will hope that vulnerability haunts them one last time. And then all it needs is for United to beat Bournemouth - but United cannot be trusted either. Manchester United's players may have been affected by an arduous coach journey that ended in such disgraceful scenes outside Upton Park - and West Ham co-owner David Sullivan's dismissive response that the visitors should simply have arrived earlier did no credit to him or his club on this landmark night. The kick-off was delayed by 45 minutes but there was still no excuse for a tepid Manchester United first half that lacked urgency, organisation and anything that would be reasonably expected with stakes so high. They were lucky to only trail to Diafra Sakho's early goal, their defence going missing in its entirety shortly afterwards when Andy Carroll raced clear only to shoot straight at David de Gea. It was as if Van Gaal had not impressed upon his players that a door to the Champions League that had looked shut for so long was suddenly ajar. Instead it looked like meaningless, end-of-season stuff. The superb Martial offered brief hope, the normally passive Van Gaal leaping from his seat to punch the air - but the joy did not last long as the visitors' vulnerability in defence was exposed. They simply could not cope with West Ham's pressure. For long spells this was a performance that made you question how such an ordinary side could even be in contention for a top-four place. They were that poor. True, they missed the aerial strength of suspended Marouane Fellaini, who operated with such success to not only combat the likes of Carroll but also score when Manchester United won 2-1 at Upton Park in the FA Cup quarter-final replay. In the final reckoning, however, this defeat was deserved after a display that produced much of the evidence that has left so many United fans questioning Van Gaal's future. Van Gaal will still believe his side can reach the Champions League but the odds are against them now so he may well end up looking to the FA Cup for success. If United win he will undoubtedly paint this as progress - and he will have a point as it would be the club's first major trophy since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013. It may not be enough, however, to suggest Van Gaal is pointing United in the right direction, despite his willingness to play youth with the emergence of 18-year-old Marcus Rashford and the signing of 20-year-old Antony Martial - who increasingly looks like a bargain at \u00a336m from Monaco. Executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward clearly wants his man to succeed and his thoughts on the future remain a mystery but there is no doubt an FA Cup win is a much harder sell than an FA Cup win and Champions League football.

The photos will be displayed alongside major works by Lucien Freud and Ron Mueck in the Ferens Art Gallery's SKIN exhibition from 22 April. Sea of Hull featured people from around the world and is said to be the largest nude installation in the UK. The models were painted blue to represent water. New York-based Mr Tunick said he noted shades of blue from various maritime paintings at the Ferens gallery during a scouting trip in 2015 and made them into body paint. He said: \"By bringing the colours of the Ferens' canvases into the streets and on to the bodies, I was able to successfully realize my vision of recreating the lost waterways of Hull with the brilliant and vibrant colours of the water.\" Ferens' art curator Kirsten Simister said the SKIN exhibition examines how the nude continues to fascinate and inspire artists.

He has gone from favourite son to outcast by a simple show of hands at a council meeting. Harris's artworks will be taken down from its chambers and his status as a freeman has been rescinded, while a plaque outside his childhood home was stolen before the local authority could remove it. \"We simply cannot tolerate the horrendous crimes for which he's been convicted,\" Bassendean Mayor John Gangell told ABC radio. And the backlash is spreading. In Melbourne a public mural, the \"Entertainers of the Century\" that features 100 prominent performers, will be changed to paint over Rolf Harris's cheery image. There is speculation, too, that Harris could be stripped of his Order of Australia award, one of the nation's most coveted honours. His conviction comes at a sensitive time for Australia, where the depravity of paedophiles is being scrutinised like never before. A royal commission into institutional responses to child sex abuse continues to uncover a terrible flood of atrocities, and could take years to complete its task. Justice Peter McClellan, who chairs it, believes that victims who have suffered alone for so long are finally coming forward because of high-profile court cases, including the conviction of Harris. \"It is becoming apparent as we do our work that as the issue of abuse is raised and talked about, survivors increasingly feel able to bring their own story to the authorities,\" said Justice McClellan. \"That which may have been kept secret for years may now be told. The burden of guilt and shame which many have felt is lifted by knowing that others who have suffered have overcome their reticence,\" he added. The law firm Slater & Gordon says since Harris's trial began it has been contacted by around a dozen women in Australia and New Zealand alleging they were molested by the TV presenter. \"My understanding is that we're talking about assaults that occurred in those countries going back to the 70s and 80s,\" said lawyer Alan Collins. \"Given what we heard in [Southwark Crown] court, a number of victims have suffered a very profound damage, I would have thought it highly likely that claims would be brought.\" Hetty Johnston, founder of one of Australia's most prominent child safety groups, Bravehearts Inc, raised the prospect of further charges against Harris. \"Rolf Harris - icon to inmate. Victims vindicated. Hopefully when he comes out there will be more victims waiting to send him right back,\" Ms Johnston tweeted. Convicted by a court half a world away, 84-year old Harris has felt the full force of media outrage back home. The Australian has detailed \"his most spectacular fall from cuddly establishment showman to jailbird,\" while the Sydney Morning Herald said he was \"always an embarrassing curiosity rather than a national treasure\". Harris was, the paper told its readers, a \"mild colonial boy who simply went bad\".", "The Reds led in the 15th minute when Divock Origi flicked in from close range before Roberto Firmino made it 2-0, heading in Nathaniel Clyne's cross. Origi also went close when his low shot was saved by Stephen Bywater. Tom Naylor inadvertently put the ball in his own net after the break before Daniel Sturridge tapped in his first and then thumped home the Reds' fifth. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp made only four changes from the XI that started in the 2-0 league defeat at Burnley on Saturday. The quality of the visiting team was soon apparent at the Pirelli Stadium against a Burton side who have had a mixed start to their first ever season in the Championship. After Liverpool's Belgian forward Origi cleverly profited from tricky work in the box from Sadio Mane, Brazilian Firmino doubled the lead following a terrible throw-out from goalkeeper Bywater. It was 3-0 just after the hour when the unfortunate Naylor had little time to react as James Milner's ball came towards him at pace. And substitute Sturridge then grabbed a late double, converting at the far post from Milner's pass before firing in low from 15 yards. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: \"There were still a few situations where we were missing a bit of sharpness but the main problem was, it was unbelievable, our build-up and style of play at Burnley - one more pass but 15 times we are completely free in the box. \"So we needed to use this game and that's what we did and it was better.\" Burton manager Nigel Clough: \"It's difficult for our lads to compete with that sort of quality. With this being 72 hours before the Derby game, our focus was always with that one. \"When you think we finished with a couple of teenagers and a 20- or 21-year-old, you could train with them for a couple of seasons and not gain the experience they've got tonight.\"", "The hosts, chasing 379 to win, began slowly and Chopra's caution increased after a middle-order collapse of three wickets for 25 runs. The opener laboured for five and a half hours for his 17th first class century off 269 balls and ended on 119 not out. Tim Ambrose (29) also played a patient innings, despite being forced to use a runner after suffering a leg injury. Hampshire bowled tightly on a pitch that became easier for batting as the day went on, with Warwickshire scoring 65 runs in the morning session. Ian Westwood (40) was trapped lbw by Andre Adams before lunch and three quick wickets after the interval strengthened the home side's decision to play for the draw. James Tomlinson picked up two scalps, including Ireland captain William Porterfield (29), before Chopra guided his side to safety. Despite scoring just 26 runs in the post-lunch session, Chopra scored more freely as he moved towards his first century as Warwickshire skipper. The draw came shortly after Ambrose chipped a full delivery from Will Smith to Gareth Berg at extra-cover. The wicket-keeper batted for an hour with a runner after suffering a gluteal strain before tea, which may rule him out of Sunday's game against champions Yorkshire. Warwickshire captain Varun Chopra: \"They bowled well and made it hard for us to score on a pitch which got slower the longer the game went. \"At the start of the day our intention was to go for the win but it was a case of taking it session by session. After Sam Hain got out and we were four wickets down, and we didn't really have any momentum to the scoring, it was always going to be pretty tough. \"But overall I was quite pleased with the way we played. There were some good performances from us, with a six-for and two centuries.\" Hampshire captain Jimmy Adams: \"At the start of the last day I thought a draw was probably the least likely result. \"The previous evening Warwickshire had got away from us a little bit and if they had started the same way today then things could have been a lot different. \"But the guys bowled well and I am really happy with the way we played over the four days.\"", "It came the day after the remains of the boiler house were demolished and the search resumed for three men killed when the building partially came down.

It comes as research suggests Oxford has one of the highest number of employees in vulnerable sectors. The BBC-commissioned study, carried out by Experian, ranks the resilience of council areas to economic shocks. In the research, Oxford was rated the third highest in England for the number of employees working in vulnerable sectors. Figures from the government estimate 48% of jobs in Oxford East are in the public sector. Mr Nigriello said Oxfordshire had very few large companies, with many people employed in the county's pioneering health services, as well as research and development, including Oxford University. He added: \"If there are massive cuts in the public sector, then Oxfordshire's private sector won't have the resilience. \"Small businesses don't have the opportunities or availability of jobs.\" A special BBC News season examining the approaching cuts to public sector spending The Spending Review: Making It Clear The Oxfordshire Economic Partnership (OEP) is a company formed by a number of business people in the county to help promote enterprise. The research also suggests Oxford has few self employed people, but that the working-age population were highly skilled. In South Oxfordshire, according to the Experian research, the situation was different, with the 11th highest proportion of those self employed in England. Mr Nigriello, who works for Unipart in Cowley, suggested the private sector should be willing to assist the public sector in making changes to their organisation. He said: \"Private sector companies would be foolish not to help. \"While we may be the engine that creates the wealth, we recognise that we need the services to create the community we want to live in\". Oxfordshire County Council is currently looking to make more than \u00c2\u00a3200m of cuts by 2015. The figure may be adjusted after the government's spending review next month.

Won't Pay!, won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1997. He was also known for Mistero Buffo, a one-man play he travelled the world with for 30 years. His plays often starred his actress wife Franca Rame. Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, a target himself of Fo's sharp wit, remembered him on Thursday as \"one of the great protagonists of theatre, culture and the civic life of our country\". He said: \"His satire, his research, his work on set design, his multi-faceted artistic activity remain the legacy of a great Italian in the world.\" Born in March 1926 in Sangiano, a small town on Lake Maggiore, Fo learned the art of storytelling from his grandfather, a travelling salesman with a gift for spinning yarns. He was conscripted towards the end of World War II but managed to escape, spending the last months of the war hidden in an attic. Moving to Milan, Fo studied architecture before turning to writing and performing. After meeting Rame in the early 1950s, he achieved success with a series of monologues that led to his own show on Italian national radio. After establishing the Fo-Rame theatre company in 1957, Fo and his wife earned national recognition with a series of hit stage farces. But their work, often critical of the political establishment, led to battles with the censors and attempts at suppression. Dario Fo thought the long Italian tradition of commedia dell'arte - broad, even slapstick humour - could be used to comment on modern society. His work was filled with energy and political protest. He drew on the history of Italian theatre but became one of the most performed modern playwrights anywhere. His early material was gentle enough, but Fo later became a sharp-eyed satirist of the Italian state and corruption. For years he was banned from Italian TV for his irreverence. His radical politics meant he was twice prevented from entering the USA. Writers, among them Arthur Miller, protested at his exclusion. When Fo was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1997, the citation said he \"emulated the jesters of the Middle Ages in scourging authority and upholding the dignity of the downtrodden\". On stage, Dario Fo made serious political points by being comic. Accidental Death of an Anarchist, Fo's best-known play, was written in response to the real-life death of a political anarchist while in police custody. First performed in 1970, it went on to be staged in more than 40 countries. Fo, who was admitted to hospital earlier this month, had been due to give a talk in Edinburgh last weekend. Playwright David Greig paid tribute, saying Scottish theatre \"owed a tremendous debt\" to \"an extraordinary theatre maker\".

The festival included a nationwide bell-ringing event, a bouncy Stonehenge and a string quartet in helicopters. By September 2012, the report said, 29% of the UK population was aware of the Olympiad and the festival. This figure rose to over 40% in London, it continued, adding the four years were believed to have seen 37.4 million attendances. The Liverpool University study, published on Thursday, also said the Olympiad helped enhance the perception of Britain abroad. But one arts expert has questioned how effectively the message about the London 2012 Festival came across. \"The numbers do not lie,\" said Marc Sands, the Tate's director of audiences and media. \"Vast swathes of the UK population and tourists visiting the UK for that incredible summer in some way experienced the London 2012 Festival. \"However, much as they may have enjoyed the event they were attending, my lasting impression is that they were unaware they were participating in a festival. \"Six months on from the end of London 2012, many people look at you blankly when you ask them about the London 2012 Festival,\" he went on. \"They remember the Olympics clearly, but are a little fuzzier about the cultural festival. \"When you ask about the cultural events that comprised the festival, they remember them well and with much affection. \"Therein lay the marketing dilemma, a gap for the festival's communications and a challenge that marketing should have solved.\" Sands was commissioned by the London 2012 Festival organisers to give his personal reflection on the 12-week event. His essay was published on Thursday alongside the official evaluation of the Cultural Olympiad, by the University of Liverpool's Institute of Cultural Capital. The report said the size of the Olympiad audience - including participants and volunteers - was estimated at 43.4 million, with an additional 204.4 million reached through broadcasts and online viewings. It said the millions of free tickets - the festival claimed 15.4 million \"free audiences or participants\" - enabled new audiences, especially young people, to attend festival events. Research showed that 19% of the population and 84% of London 2012 Festival attendees believed the festival made a \"positive contribution\" to the games. In his introduction to the report, Tony Hall, chair of the Cultural Olympiad Board, said festival organisers had hoped the cultural programme would be \"a game changer\". The intention, he wrote in his introduction to the report, had been \"putting art at the heart of the Games themselves, showcasing UK world-class excellence with high economic stakes to play for cultural tourism and creative industries\". \"Communities all over the UK participated with enthusiasm, and the majority have been inspired to carry on enjoying culture and creativity,\" he continued. Formerly chief executive of the Royal Opera House and now director general of the BBC, Lord Hall took over the running of the Cultural Olympiad in 2009. Highlights of the London 2012 Festival programme included the World Shakespeare Festival, Mark Rylance's sonnets on the London Underground, and Deborah Warner's Peace Camp project, which featured encampments of glowing tents in remote coastal locations. The Cultural Olympiad also included Unlimited - the largest ever commission of art by disabled and deaf artists - during the Paralympic Games. Culture Secretary Maria Miller described the events of the previous year as an \"enormous success\". Speaking at the launch of the report at London's Barbican, she said: \"The Cultural Olympiad inspired an entire generation to really think again about how they participate in cultural events and activities.\" Cultural Olympiad director Ruth Mackenzie said she had been to Rio - where the next Olympics will take place in 2016 - to discuss with arts organisations \"how to put culture at the heart of the games\".", "The cockpit voice recorder from the accident off Shetland in 2013, in which four people died, was recovered by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch. A judge ruled it was in the public interest and the interests of justice to make it available. The British Airline Pilots' Association (Balpa) said it had lodged an appeal. The  union's general secretary, Jim McAuslan, said: \"The 2013 Supa Puma accident was tragic, and it is vital the AAIB gets to the root cause and has access to whatever data it needs. \"However, providing the data to the prosecutor and the police in parallel to the AAIB's investigation cuts across everything pilots and the broader flight safety community stand for. \"We cannot stand by while the court allows that to happen without pursuing other legal avenues to highlight our concerns and question whether it is the correct approach.\" Prosecutors have been trying to establish whether anybody could be held criminally responsible for the crash. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) has the right to initial access to the cockpit voice recorder but it routinely chooses not to hand over the material to other bodies - in this case the Crown prosecutors. The BBC Scotland news website revealed last year an order was being sought by Lord Advocate Frank Mulholland QC at the Court of Session to access the data. It was a rare legal move. Lord Jones said he was satisfied that disclosing the data would have no adverse impact on current or future crash investigations - but that it could only be disclosed to the Crown Office and Police Scotland. A total of 18 people were on board when the Super Puma crashed on its approach to Sumburgh. Helicopter passengers Sarah Darnley from Elgin, Gary McCrossan, from Inverness, Duncan Munro, from Bishop Auckland, and George Allison, from Winchester, lost their lives.", "Having a baby is a joyous occasion for most women - but for one in 10, pregnancy and the period following childbirth can be anything but rosy. Depression, anxiety and stress can be the overriding feelings they experience and, if left untreated, the risk increases that they develop into serious psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, psychoses and eating disorders. The mental health of this group of women during pregnancy and after birth - whether the illness already existed beforehand or developed for the first time - has been of particular concern to mental health professionals for some time. Psychiatric disorders are the cause of 7% of all maternal deaths during pregnancy and the six months after the birth. So why are there still women falling through the net? Guidelines from NICE, the health watchdog, say women at risk of mental health problems should receive extra support at all stages of pregnancy, be provided with a care plan for their treatment and be offered advice on the safest and most appropriate drugs to take during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Research suggests providing this level of care will improve not only the long-term well-being of the mother but protect the child's emotional and physical development too. But the Maternal Mental Health Alliance (MMHA), which represents more than 70 organisations committed to improving the mental health of mothers and their infants, says this isn't happening in many areas of the country. Dr Alain Gregoire, consultant and honorary senior lecturer in perinatal psychiatry, and chair of the MMHA, says this failure is costing lives. Suicide is an increased risk for women with serious perinatal psychiatric disorders, he says. And then there's the cost to society, he points out, of \u00c2\u00a38bn a year in lost earnings and NHS care. He says: \"It's a very critical time in women's lives and it's important to get it right.\" The inquest heard that Ms Bevan stopped taking her anti-psychotic medication some time before the birth of her daughter because she wanted to breastfeed. Dr Gregoire says decisions like this should be part of a care plan agreed in advance and need not be a major issue, he adds. \"There are many medication options available with no evidence of risk to the baby, whereas there is clear evidence that women being unwell is not good for mother or baby.\" Stopping medication suddenly is never advised and can be avoided because there are always other effective treatment options, he says. Rachael Jones felt no connection with her pregnancy and no happiness at the thought of son's arrival five years ago. She had always wanted children but she didn't tell anyone how she was feeling because she didn't understand the feelings herself. \"No-one asked me how I was feeling. There wasn't an opportunity to talk about it, no invitation to chat about it from anyone I saw.\" It was only after the birth that Rachael admitted to a health visitor that she felt detached, lonely and depressed. She had experienced suicidal thoughts too. During a 12-month wait for talking therapy on the NHS, she relied on family and friends to help her get through each day with postnatal depression. And, in the meantime, she set up a charity dedicated to pre and postnatal depression advice and support, called the PANDAS Foundation. She says the Charlotte Bevan inquest demonstrates how important it is for pregnant women to be able to talk about their mental health. Rachael wants communication between health professionals to improve so that women like her are properly supported during pregnancy. She also believes doctors and midwives need a better understanding of mental health so that they can ask the right questions and offer support at the right times. If or when a pregnant woman's mental health deteriorates, the guidelines state that all women with a child under a year old should be offered a place in one of the 17 specialist psychiatric care mother and baby units in the UK. But a map of these dedicated mother and baby units, with an average of eight beds per unit, show that some areas such as the south, south-west and east of England, and Wales, are noticeably underserved. Another map of specialist community perinatal mental health teams across the UK shows there is a very patchy service, with most areas having an extremely basic level of provision, or none at all. However, Alistair Burt, Minister of State for Community and Social Care, said perinatal mental health was a strong priority for the government and it was investing \u00c2\u00a375m over the next five years \"to help drive improvements\". \"Since 2010 the number of in-patient mother and baby units which specialise in caring for women during the perinatal period has almost doubled and we have trained more than 600 perinatal mental health visitor champions.\" The Royal College of Midwives has said that more midwives with specialist training in mental health are needed to work with at-risk women. But this relies on GPs, midwives and health visitors recognising that their patients are suffering in the first place. NHS England estimates that around 3% of women who give birth each year will be referred to psychiatric services and 1% will need specialised care in a mother and baby unit. That's 6,700 women with serious mental illnesses who need specialist help. They are at one end of a wide spectrum of mental illnesses which can affect pregnant women - ranging from mild to severe. Rachael did not take any medication for her condition. All she wanted was to speak to someone else who felt the way she did, so she could feel normal. Instead, she suffered in silence.", "He called on Prime Minister Theresa May to accept all refugee children with a legal right to be in the UK, ahead of French plans to shut the \"Jungle\" camp. Mr Jones said Wales was ready to support the UK government in welcoming greater numbers of vulnerable children. The Home Office said its priority was to ensure the safety of children in the Calais camp. Mr Jones made the case in a joint statement with Kirsty Davies-Warner, head of Oxfam Cymru; Mary Powell-Chandler, head of Save the Children in Wales; Huw Thomas, head of Christian Aid Wales, and Jim Barnaville, co-chair of Citizens Cymru Wales. The statement said Mr Jones had written to the prime minister expressing \"our shared view that the UK government should take urgent action to resettle more unaccompanied refugee children in the UK and offering the support of Wales in welcoming them\". With the French government set to demolish the Calais \"Jungle\" camp, the statement asked Mrs May to \"allow all those refugee children with a legal right to be in the UK into the country with the utmost urgency\". \"The children in the camp, some of whom have been as young as eight years old, have fled conflict and persecution and are now stuck in northern France, deeply traumatised and at considerable risk,\" the statement read. \"Every extra day we take places these children at greater risk.\" The Immigration Act included an amendment, originally put forward by Lord Dubs, that places a legal requirement on government to arrange for the transfer to the UK of unaccompanied refugee children from Europe. The statement welcomed a commitment from the UK government to resettle children who have a legal right to be in the UK, but called on Ms May to do more, adding: \"Wales is ready to support the UK government in welcoming more vulnerable children as refugees via the Dubs amendment\". The children's charity Unicef has appealed to the UK government to speed up the transfer of unaccompanied child refugees in Calais. It has said it is concerned the planned closure of the camp will lead to children there disappearing before they are processed. A Home Office spokesman said: \"Our priority must be to ensure the safety and security of the children in the Calais camp.\" He said that Home Secretary Amber Rudd had told the French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve that the UK government intended to transfer as many minors as possible eligible under the Dublin Regulation before the start of the clearance. Under the Dublin Regulation, asylum seekers must make an initial asylum claim in the first EU state they reach, but can apply for asylum in other EU states if they have family there. \"In addition, children who are eligible to come to the UK under the Dubs Amendment to the Immigration Act 2016 must be looked after in safe facilities where their best interests are properly considered,\" the spokesman added. \"Work is continuing on both sides of the Channel to ensure this happens as a matter of urgency.\"", "The former Hearts captain recently left Leeds, having moved to Elland Road last summer despite a trial at Rangers. \"I'm excited to come here from Leeds and on the first day it felt like it was the right decision,\" Zaliukas told the club's website. \"It's a brilliant stadium and it's going to be fun to play here.\" Zaliukas played more than 200 times for Hearts over seven years, but made just 15 appearances for Leeds last term. His first competitive match for Rangers could be against Hibs in the Challenge Cup on 5 August. The Ibrox outfit's first Scottish Championship fixture of the campaign is against Hearts at Ibrox on 10 August. \"I think the Championship is going to be a very interesting league because Hearts and Hibs are in here, and even Falkirk and Queen of the South are going to be tough teams,\" the 30-year-old added. \"I think our squad could compete straight away in the Premiership, everyone is experienced and top players. I think we are going to have a very good squad.\" Rangers have also added former St Mirren defender Darren McGregor to their ranks this summer.", "Jolie, whose directorial debut is set in Bosnia's 1992 to 1995 war, received a standing ovation as she picked up the honorary Heart of Sarajevo award. \"I told Brad in the car I was afraid I was going to cry,\" she said. She presented the festival's best actor award to Thomas Schubert who starred in Atman, also named best film. Romanian leading lady Ada Condeescu won best actress for her role in Loverboy. Jolie, 36, who was at the 17th Sarajevo Film Festival with boyfriend Brad Pitt, visited Bosnia several times last year as a goodwill ambassador for the UN's refugee agency. She said she was \"so honoured to be here\". \"There is no greater example of the strengths of the artists and the festival that began during the war and grew stronger every year,\" she added. The festival began as an act of resistance in 1995 with residents braving mortar shells to gather in a basement to watch Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction. Some scenes from Jolie's film In the Land of Blood and Honey - due for release in December - were shot in Bosnia while others were shot in Hungary. The film, which stars Zana Marjanovic and Rade Serbedzija, tells the story of a love affair between a Bosnian Muslim woman and a Serb, on opposite sides of the conflict. The licence to film in Sarajevo was at one point revoked following local rumours that the film featured a rape victim who falls in love with her assailant. The licence was given back when producers proved the rumour was not true. At the time, Jolie asked people to \"hold judgement until they have seen the film\". \"There are many twists in the plot that address the sensitive nature of the relationship between the main characters and that will be revealed once the film is released,\" she said. On her visits to Bosnia for the UN last year, Jolie drew attention to the thousands of people who have been unable to return to their homes despite the war ending 16 years ago.", "The starter at the Gailes course was calling Monty to arms for his second round of the day. His first went well, exceptionally well. The eight-time European number one rolling back the years to card a five-under-par 66. As the Scot limbered, former BBC commentator David Begg, who was on marshalling duty, informed me that: \"Monty is putting beautifully.\" He added: \"Ten putts on the back nine.\" More of the same and Monty would be a shoe-in for one last Open hurrah on his home course of Royal Troon, surely. After all, he ended his first round a shot off the lead and there are three qualifying places up for grabs. No wonder Monty is, as one mature observer informs me, \"all sweetness and light\". Will it last? Only one way to find out. To set out in the footsteps of Monty, or at least follow him round the course. The former Ryder Cup captain is joined in game 10 by Sam Robinson, from Market Raisen, and John Henry, from Clydebank. But, apart from a coterie of family and friends of the two younger men, the punters are here to see if Monty can do it. There must be at least 150 ready to follow the big man round. \"It doesn't get much better than this,\" a young golf enthusiast tells me. \"You can walk right behind him on the fairways, no ropes or anything like that, and the players even talk to you.\" That said, there's a sort of 10-yard de facto exclusion zone around Monty as he stalks the fairways with loping strides. After all, you don't want to get too close, just in case. Monty starts well, finding the green with his second shot and leaving him a 12-foot putt for birdie. It's in! Today, it seems, he has the magic touch. \"He's in great form, chatting away,\" an elderly gent informs me before another observer, also of mature years, chips in: \"No he's not.\" You couldn't say there's a lot of love in the air for Monty. More like deep admiration and respect for one of our greatest-ever golfers and, yes, a little fear. \"Stand still please,\" he rebukes a couple of golf fans who stray into his eyeline as he prepares to tee off. They freeze, mildly embarrassed, until the moment passes. Alas, Monty's second round is not the same sort of birdie fest as his morning session. The putts just aren't dropping like they did before lunch, but he's fighting for every stroke. This means more to him he says than anyone else in the field - one last chance to qualify for an Open on his home course. Mind you, if he misses out here, he will still get in with a top-four finish at the Scottish Open! Monty only manages one more birdie in his second round and a couple of bogeys, both at par threes, mean he finishes on level par. However, there are flashes of brilliance, particularly at the 15th, where he overcomes a horrible lie to save par. And there is none of the \"unravelling\" predicted by one doom monger. By the time Monty gets to the 18th green, there are a couple of hundred spectators looking on. When he taps out for par, there is no ovation. His followers are too anxious for that. \"Will five under be enough? Is the young Swede still 10 under? What about the closing pack.\" You see, judging by the demographic of my fellow travellers round 18 holes at Gailes, they don't want this journey to end. They've been following Monty's triumphs and travails for years and, to a degree, shared in them - haven't we all. As Monty lopes into the recorder's office, a small crowd gathers outside. Media men and onlookers. When he emerges, he signs autographs for a couple of young fans and speaks to reporters, telling them: \"I hope and pray I've done enough. We'll just have to wait and see.\" Ending with this promise: \"If I make it, I'll come back and talk to you.\" Indeed, he did make it, just, edging out compatriot Jack Doherty (not the television comic) by a stroke to finish third behind Oskar Arvidsson of Sweden and Scott Fernandez of Spain.", "Royal Berkshire Fire Authority announced on Tuesday it would close Pangbourne station as part of plans to help it save \u00a31.4m. In the public consultation, the closure of Pangbourne station was the most popular option. The closure of Wargrave station in Wokingham Borough was deferred for a year, but Pangbourne station in West Berkshire is to close permanently. The Royal Berkshire Fire and Rescue Service said there was a possibility Wargrave station could close if funding was not found elsewhere and if the station, which is currently manned part-time by retained firefighters, did not increase its availability from 2.4% to 60%. West Berkshire Conservative councillor Emma Webster - who sits on the fire authority, said: \"I understand the concerns raised by residents and the local community. \"I think the most important thing that people need to remember is that residents across the whole of Berkshire will remain safe. \"If they need to dial 999 they will get the service they expect in a prompt and timely manner to assist them in their hour of need.\"", "Councillors are unhappy Ordnance Survey (OS) maps only refer to Black Rock Sands near Porthmadog by that name. But it is also know locally as Traeth Morfa Bychan - after the village next to the shoreline. OS told the authority the name was adopted after consultation with the council, and they had been told the English version was most commonly used. \"During the council's Language Committee, members declared their commitment to protecting indigenous Welsh names and places in Gwynedd,\" said a council spokesperson. They said they would continue to collaborate with agencies such as OS to \"ensure that the correct names are used wherever possible\". \"In this case, the discussion with the OS will continue regarding the possibilities for changing the name that appears on their maps,\" added the Gwynedd official. \"In the meantime Gwynedd council will consult with community councils in the specific area, to gather evidence that will enable the council to submit robust evidence to the OS for changing the name that appears on their maps.\"", "Even with the usual caveats attached to opinion polls, a 65% to 17% majority for Northern Ireland remaining in the UK suggests little room for doubt. The British and Irish governments have both made it clear they don't think now is the time to hold a border poll. Sinn Fein are campaigning for a poll and the DUP have discussed, in their words, calling Sinn Fein's bluff. But after weeks of controversy about flags and national identity, politicians' claims about Catholic unionism, and a census showing a growing number identifying themselves as Northern Irish, what lies behind that headline figure in the Spotlight opinion poll is particularly revealing. Not surprisingly, more than 90% of those who identify themselves as Protestants told the pollsters they wanted to stay in the UK. But on the other side of the religious divide, a substantial 38% of Catholics also favoured remaining within the UK - three percentage points more than the number who backed a united Ireland. While only 5% of Protestants don't intend to vote or haven't decided which option they would pick, more than a quarter of Catholics are either undecided or not planning on voting. As avowed believers in a united Ireland and the party running a border poll campaign, Sinn Fein might be surprised to learn that nearly a quarter of those who identified themselves as Sinn Fein voters - 23% - told the pollsters they would back the status quo in a border poll. More than half of SDLP supporters - 56% - also said they would opt to stay in the UK if a poll was held tomorrow. Prime Minister David Cameron said the survey for the BBC Spotlight programme on the potential outcome of a border poll should lift the spirits of all those who value Northern Ireland's place within the union. The results of the 2011 census, released in December last year, revealed that just over a fifth of the population considers itself \"Northern Irish\". That posed a political puzzle - in a border poll would these people tick a British or an Irish box? Well, those who identified themselves as \"Northern Irish\" for the BBC Spotlight poll back staying in the UK by a significant margin - 72% to just 7%. At the DUP conference late last year Peter Robinson hinted that his party hopes to make inroads into Catholic unionist territory. Since then commentators have expressed the view that the union flag dispute and the ensuing protests make this a pipe dream. The Spotlight survey suggests the main parties have a long way to go to reach across the religious divide. Those identifying themselves as DUP supporters are 97% Protestant, while UUP supporters are 99% Protestant. Those backing Sinn Fein are 99% Catholic, while SDLP supporters are 92% Catholic. Alliance, as an identifiably centre ground party, is the one bucking the trend - with 51% Protestant backing and 36% Catholic support. Alliance's support for a \"designated days\" flag flying policy at Belfast City Hall stirred controversy and led to attacks on the party's offices and a death threat against its only MP, Naomi Long. However the Spotlight poll suggests raising the flag on 18 designated days is the most popular compromise across the community as a whole. Of those interviewed, 44% backed the designated days policy, in comparison to 35% wanting the union flag raised throughout the year. A further 10% told the pollsters no flag should be flown at the City Hall, while only 2% opted for the union flag flying alongside the Irish tricolour. Although designated days was the most popular option, flag flying polarises unionists and nationalists. 73% of unionists want the union flag up at Belfast City Hall 365 days a year, while 64% of nationalists support the 18 day policy. Even though the designated days compromise got more support than any other option, just over half of those interviewed thought the union flag protestors were right to take to the streets when Belfast City Council made its decision in early December. This result may reflect some people's belief in the right to protest, even if they don't back the aim of a particular demonstration. However this support appears to have dwindled sharply during the course of January, as by the time the Spotlight survey was carried out more than three quarters of interviewees wanted the protests to stop. They told the pollsters this was for a variety of reasons, the main ones being the violence sparked by some protests and the disruptive impact on business. Although the Stormont politicians might take heart from this shift of opinion, the protest organisers will point to the fact that by late January 45% of unionists still believed the demonstrations should continue. This shows a degree of resilience given the barrage of negative publicity generated by the protests. The poll was carried out for the BBC Spotlight programme by Ipsos Mori, whose researchers interviewed more than 1000 adults at 64 locations across Northern Ireland between 17 and 26 January. The full details are available as a pdf, 897kb in size. They include findings on how people rated individual politicians' handling of the flags crisis, which parties those interviewed support and whether those surveyed believe the Stormont system favours one community over another.", "Police have charged a 32-year-old Norwegian man over both attacks. The man dressed as a police officer was arrested on tiny Utoeya island after an hour-long shooting spree. Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg said many people were still looking for their children and had not so far been able to locate them. He was speaking after meeting victims and relatives with Norway's King Harald, Queen Sonja and Crown Prince Haakon in the town of Sundvollen near the island. Values attackedHome-grown plot?In pictures: Shock Mr Stoltenberg said he was \"deeply touched\" by the meetings. \"We will do whatever we can to give them as much support as possible,\" he said. Earlier he said that he was due to have been on Utoeya - \"a youth paradise turned into a hell\" - a few hours after the attack took place. The suspect is reported by local media to have had links with right-wing extremists. He has been named as Anders Behring Breivik. Police searched his Oslo apartment overnight and are questioning him. The BBC's Richard Galpin, near the island which is currently cordoned off by police, says that Norway has had problems with neo-Nazi groups in the past but the assumption was that such groups had been largely eliminated and did not pose a significant threat. Police say they are investigating whether the attacks were the work of one man or whether others helped. \"At Utoeya, the water is still being searched for more victims,\" deputy police chief Roger Andresen told reporters. \"We have no more information than... what has been found on [his] own websites, which is that it goes towards the right and that it is, so to speak, Christian fundamentalist.\" By Richard GalpinBBC News, near Utoeya A search is going on not just on the island itself, but also in the waters around it because a lot of people tried to escape by jumping in the water and trying to swim away. Even as they did that, eyewitnesses say, the gunman opened fire on them. The chatter now is that it took the police an hour, if not an hour and a half, to actually get to the island. Of course that gave the gunman so much time to kill so many people. Also crucially, the police were throwing all their resources at the huge bomb attack which had just taken place in the centre of Oslo. But still, the question will be asked: Were there not police nearer to this area who could have moved in much more quickly? Local media report that police are investigating claims by witnesses that a second person was involved, apparently not disguised in a police uniform. A farm supply firm has confirmed selling six tonnes of fertiliser to Mr Breivik who is reported to have run a farming company. Speculation has been rife that fertiliser could have been used in the Oslo bomb. The number killed in the island shooting spree, which is among the world's most deadly, had been put at 10 on Friday - but soared overnight. Hundreds of young people had been attending the summer camp organised by the governing Labour Party on Utoeya island. Eyewitnesses described how a tall, blond man dressed as a policeman opened fire indiscriminately, prompting camp attendees to jump into the water to try to escape the hail of bullets. Some of the teenagers were shot at as they tried to swim to safety. Armed police were deployed to the island but details of the operation to capture the suspect remain unclear. After his arrest he was charged with committing acts of terrorism. Profile: Anders Behring Breivik Police say they discovered many more victims after searching the area around the island. They have warned the death toll may rise further as rescue teams continue to scour the waters around the island. The gunman is reported to have been armed with a handgun, an automatic weapon and a shotgun. \"He travelled on the ferry boat from the mainland over to that little inland island posing as a police officer, saying he was there to do research in connection with the bomb blasts,\" NRK journalist Ole Torp told the BBC. \"He asked people to gather round and then he started shooting, so these young people fled into the bushes and woods and some even swam off the island to get to safety.\" One 15-year-old eyewitness described how she saw what she thought was a police officer open fire. \"He first shot people on the island. Afterward he started shooting people in the water,\" youth camp delegate Elise told Associated Press. The attacks sparked strong international condemnation, with US President Barack Obama expressing his condolences and offering support. Britain's Queen Elizabeth II spoke of her shock and sadness in a letter to King Harald. In Oslo, government officials urged people to stay at home and avoid central areas of the city. Shards of twisted metal, rubble and glass littered the streets of central Oslo left devastated by Friday's enormous explosion. Windows in the buildings of the government quarter were shattered and witnesses described how smoke filled the atmosphere around the blast site. The BBC's John Sopel in Oslo says there is a heavy military presence, with checkpoints around the quarter. Mr Stoltenberg said civil servants were among the dead in Oslo and he knew some of those killed. There are also concerns that more victims may still be inside buildings hit by the initial massive explosion.", "Moreno, 24, is also wanted by former club Sevilla in La Liga, while Serie A giants AC Milan and Inter Milan have expressed an interest in the left-back. Liverpool will insist on \u00a330m for France defender Mamadou Sakho, who had a spell at Crystal Palace last term. And winger Lazar Markovic is a target for Watford and Zenit St Petersburg. Moreno was displaced at left-back by James Milner last season but Reds manager Jurgen Klopp is in no hurry to sell the player, although Moreno may also want more first-team football at this stage of his career. The Anfield club are confident they will get their full asking price for Sakho, 27, given the current market for centre-backs and the player's successful loan spell at Premier League rivals Palace last season. Serbia winger Markovic is another player unlikely to be in Klopp's plans, especially following the addition of \u00a334m forward Mohamed Salah from Roma. New Watford manager Marco Silva may make a move for the 23-year-old, who joined Liverpool from Benfica in a \u00a320m deal three years ago, after being impressed with Markovic during a loan spell at Hull City last season. Russian side Zenit have also shown an interest in Markovic, who has had loan spells at Fenerbahce and Sporting Lisbon.", "The Senegal international, 26, joined for \u00a39m from Lille in July 2015 and played 35 times as Villa were relegated from the Premier League last season.

Gueye only missed three league games for Villa in 2015-16 and scored his only goal for the club in their FA Cup fourth round win against Wycombe in January. It is believed the fee that has activated the departure clause is about \u00a37m, with Villa bracing themselves for further offers.", "Kevin Whyman, 39, was killed in the crash at Oulton Park, Cheshire, at about 14:00 BST on Saturday.

A minute's silence has been held at the festival site and visitors stopped to pay their respects. Mr Evans said the crash in which Mr Whyman was killed was a \"tragic accident\". A visibly upset Evans told reporters: \"Our condolences go out to his family, who have been informed. \"The police have also advised us that the best thing and the safest thing to do is to carry on with the event, bearing in mind that there are 10,000 children here - and that is what we are going to do.\" CarFest organisers said the festival had resumed but there would be no further aerial displays. Mr Whyman, nicknamed \"Jester\", was a member of the Gnat Display Team and married with a young daughter. In a statement, Heritage Aircraft Trust, which runs the team, said: \"Kevin was a Royal Air Force-trained fast jet pilot whose enthusiasm for flying the Folland Gnat was infectious. \"He will be greatly missed by his family, the team and many friends. \"Kevin leaves a wife and young daughter. Please respect the privacy of family members and of the team at this most difficult time.\" Shocked spectators fell silent as the plane suddenly nosedived during the display, before disappearing behind trees. Moments later a plume of thick black smoke billowed in to the sky. BBC producer Justin Bones, at the scene, said two planes had performed a low-level, close-proximity pass just before the crash. One of the aircraft had failed to pull up and crashed north of the circuit, he said. Mr Whyman, who started flying the Folland Gnat in 2005, was one of the founder members of the display team in 2007. He lived in Westminster, central London, and split his leisure time between the airfield during the summer months and the ski slopes of the Swiss Alps during the winter. An Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) spokesman said it would be investigating the incident and sending a team to the site. Cheshire Police is also investigating. Mr Whyman, who was born in Chester, was a Cambridge University economics graduate. He trained with the university's boat club and coxed Cambridge to victory in the 1996 and 1997 boat races against Oxford. He had a career with the RAF from 1998 to 2001, when he left for a trading job with a US investment bank in the City of London. He completed his civilian flying licences so that he could continue to fly. Evans is a car enthusiast and was recently named as the new presenter of the BBC's Top Gear show. CarFest is described on its Twitter profile as his \"dream of the perfect family festival\", featuring cars, planes and music while raising money for BBC Children In Need. The weekend event in Cheshire began on Friday and a second festival is due to be held in Hampshire later this month.", "Greenwood, 22, featured in the 2015 Women's World Cup and is the club's eighth signing of the transfer window. \"This is a fantastic move for me and I am really enthusiastic about the new season,\" she told the club's website. \"I had a great year at Notts County but this represents an exciting, new challenge and one that I am really looking forward to.\" The fee, which is undisclosed, is a club record sale for Notts County who \"reluctantly\" accepted the offer from Liverpool. \"We received a significant bid from Liverpool, which was close to our valuation for the player, and considering her wish to leave we reluctantly accepted the offer,\" Notts County Ladies chief executive Matthew Alexander said.", "South African firm Famous Brands signed a \u00a3120m deal to buy the chain from Nando's owner, Capricorn Ventures. Gourmet Burger Kitchen, founded in 2001, was a \"pioneer of the premium burger revolution\", Famous Brands said. The company says that it wants to open 10 to 15 more burger restaurants a year in the UK. The mass-market burger giants, McDonalds and Burger King, first opened in the UK in the 1970s. While those brands have continued to expand, by the end of the 1990s a new fashion for more expensive burgers had arrived, again from the US. Upmarket burger brands in the UK now include Byron, Shake Shack and Five Guys, as well as an increasing number of independents. According to analysts Mintel, the premium burger market now accounts for sales worth more than \u00a33bn a year. Famous Brands plans to double Gourmet Burger Kitchen's 75 UK stores in the next five years and said Brexit uncertainty would not affect its plans. Consumers still want food that is quick and convenient, but are willing to pay for better ingredients, said Famous Brands' Kevin Hedderwick. \"The fast-casual premium environment is pretty recession-proof,\" he said. The price difference between upmarket and fast-food burger shops is quite striking. Whereas a typical McDonald's quarter-pounder with cheese will set you back less than \u00a33, a Gourmet Burger Kitchen 4oz classic cheeseburger is more than \u00a36. But Gourmet Burger Kitchen also sells more unusual fare, including buffalo burgers and Persian lamb. Food fashions in the UK range from the super-health-conscious to the indulgent. And at the indulgent end of the scale, consumers are focusing on the quality of the ingredients and being able to personalise the menu, by selecting different options. \"Consumers see freshly made burgers as the biggest marker of a gourmet burger venue, something that sets them apart, as this is not traditionally offered by fast food venues,\" said Kiti Soininen, head of UK food and drink research at Mintel. \"Customisation is also a top expectation for gourmet offerings, in line with a more general demand for knowing what goes into one's food and the trend for personalisation.\"", "The 22-year-old student was assaulted and robbed by a gang of youths in a side street when he was in primary school. It was a long time ago, but he still crosses the road if a large group of people are coming his way. After all, everyone in his family has been targeted in a similar fashion. France's ethnic Chinese population have long suffered casual racism and been stereotyped as easy targets for crime. But they say they have now reached breaking point. In August, 49-year-old tailor and father-of-two Zhang Chaolin died in hospital after being attacked by three teenagers. He had been walking in a quiet street in the north Paris suburb of Aubervilliers. Zhang was reportedly kicked in the sternum and fell, striking his head on the pavement.  The aim of the attack was allegedly to steal his friend's bag. The tailor had nothing on him except sweets and cigarettes. In response, on 4 September, at least 15,000 ethnic Chinese turned out in Paris's Place de la Republique to give vent to their deep feelings of insecurity. Estimated at more than 600,000 people, France has Europe's largest Chinese community. But they have not been in the country as long as more prominent migrant groups, including those from Africa. David was born in Paris to parents who migrated from China in the early 1990s. He says he has been asked publicly if he eats dogs, and has been called a \"spring roll head\". He has also been told to \"go back to his own country\" and \"go and work with his little Chinese hands\". Such jibes might be familiar to east Asian migrants and their descendants across the West. As with British Chinese, French Chinese say that racist comments toward them are tolerated, in a way that they are not for more established migrant communities. But in France, there is a sense that Asian migrants are targeted with particularly nasty violence. \"[These attacks] are because of the beliefs they have about us,\" says David, who is too fearful to use his real name. A working-class and immigrant-heavy area, home to more than 1,200 mostly Chinese wholesalers, Aubervilliers is an important European textile centre. Buyers come from far and wide to haggle over Italian-made coats and Chinese-made shirts. Activists say at least 100 attacks against Chinese nationals were reported in the suburb in just the first seven months of this year. France does not keep statistics based on ethnicity, so it is difficult to know the real number of incidents. Meriem Derkaoui, the suburb's communist mayor, condemned Zhang's murder as \"racist targeting\". Community groups say such attacks are driven by a perception that Chinese people are weak, will not fight back and carry a lot of cash. During a recent trial of three youths accused of 11 attacks in a three-month span in Aubervilliers, the defendants insisted the ethnicity of their targets was just a coincidence. But when interrogated by police, they reportedly admitted to seeing Chinese people as \"easy targets\" with money on them. In interviews with the BBC, several ethnic Chinese shopkeepers and residents of Aubervilliers said they felt that the level of violence was getting worse. \"It's getting out of hand. The situation had stabilised in recent years, but now it's broken out again,\" says Franky Song, 20, who works in a jeans shop in the CIFA Fashion Business Center. Inter-communal relations in the area have deteriorated, he adds. In this shopping centre, home to a few hundred clothing wholesalers, everyone would know someone who had been assaulted, he said. \"We have the businesses, but not the build, so they take advantage of us.\" Heng, a middle-aged lady who has run a florist's with her husband in Aubervilliers for 17 years, joined the recent protests because of the \"horrible situation\" in the suburb. Her shop has been broken into twice, and her insurer will no longer cover it. The anger of people like Franky and Heng is mostly directed towards the state, which they say has failed to protect them. Zhang's death was the final straw. It prompted a community normally regarded as quietly focused on work and family to take a public stand. \"Asian people are not used to being in the spotlight; they like to be in the shadows,\" says Frederic Chau, a well-known comedian and actor of Cambodian-Chinese descent. He has played a high-profile role in the \"Safety for All\" campaign, which previously organised demonstrations in 2010 and 2011. \"To be more than 20,000 people in the Place de la Republique to make this protest - it's not normal, for us, [especially] for my mother, my father, my uncles. \"But doing this is necessary because we have had enough. We have to do something to change the mentality in France.\" As one of the Indochinese refugees who arrived in France in the 1970s with the legal right to residence, Frederic is part of an ethnic Chinese community considered better integrated in French society than their mainland Chinese counterparts. France's colonial history meant that some of these refugees from Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia - many, like Frederic, of Chinese descent - already spoke French. The Chinese wholesale trade in Aubervilliers, on the other hand, is dominated by migrants from Wenzhou, a city in China's southeast known for its entrepreneurial migrants. They mostly arrived in the late 1980s and early 1990s, with the first generation struggling with the French language. Ya-Han Chuang researched the integration of Chinese migrants for her doctorate at Paris-Sorbonne University. She says that compared to the Indochinese, these mainland migrants have struggled to accrue \"cultural capital\". \"The fact that they tend to work in and inherit family enterprises creates some more barriers,\" she says. But Rui Wang, the son of Wenzhounese migrants and president of the Association of French-Chinese Youth, belies the stereotypes. Born in China but raised in France, he casually quotes French philosophers and sociologists like Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Pierre Bourdieu. Articulate and driven, he has written to Prime Minister Manuel Valls to warn him that the situation in places like Aubervilliers is \"explosive\". He describes how husbands will pick up their wives and children from metro stations and schools in groups of five to six people for safety reasons. In La Courneuve, near Aubervilliers, look-outs are posted near weddings to prevent robberies. Security information and patrols are coordinated via the WeChat messaging app. \"There is an anger that has accumulated for too long,\" Rui says. The association's immediate demands are straightforward: more police and security resources. Since the demonstrations in August and September, extra police officers have been promised for Aubervilliers. But according to Rui, city hall says it cannot afford to provide more security cameras. The mayor did not respond to requests for comment on these issues. The recent protests have captured rare media and political attention for a community unused to the limelight. Alain Juppe, a former prime minister and likely presidential candidate, visited the family of Zhang Chaolin in early September. Speaking to French-Chinese in the area, he condemned rising incidents of \"anti-Chinese racism\" and spoke of France \"finding harmony between its communities\". This is equally important for Rui. He wants more support from the government for social projects that build links between different migrant communities. Frederic Chau, the actor, feels the same way. He describes his family home's doormat as being like a border between France and China when he was growing up: \"I rejected my origins, I wanted to be whiter than white\". Now, he has fully embraced his Cambodian and Chinese origins, and is proud of them. What France's Asians want now, Frederic says, is to be \"considered French\". When perceptions change, they hope a sense of security will follow.", "Arsenal will play Chelsea on 6 August at Wembley Stadium, and \u00a31.25m could be raised from the match. Football Association chairman Greg Clarke said: \"We hope that in some small way through the Community Shield we can help. \"Football is for all, and we hope it can in its own way give something back to those who are most in need.\" The EFL said it would also be donating \u00a3175,000, with member clubs contributing their share of proceeds from the match. Chief executive Shaun Harvey said football was \"coming together to make a significant commitment to the cause\". Premier League clubs have agreed to contribute a total of \u00a3250,000. \"The thoughts of everyone at the league and our clubs are with the people affected by this terrible event,\" a statement read.

Lee Westwood is third on two under, one ahead of fellow Englishmen Justin Rose, Andy Sullivan and Matt Fitzpatrick. Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy rallied with three late birdies in a 72, while 2015 champion Jordan Spieth carded 75. England's reigning champion Danny Willett started his defence with a double bogey and a bogey before fighting back to finish one-over par. World number one Dustin Johnson pulled out on the first tee after injuring his back when slipping on the stairs at his rental house on Wednesday. Scoring was expected to be tough at Augusta with high winds forecast to become even stronger as the opening day progressed. And that proved to be the case as it became a distinct possibility that no player would shoot under 70 in the opening round for the first time in 60 years. But the tricky conditions proved little obstacle for McGirt and, particularly, Hoffman, who were the only players to do so. Hoffman has only previously claimed one top-25 finish at a major, tying for ninth at the 2015 Masters, but put together a remarkable round. The world number 52 closed the front nine with two birdies to move two-under, then blitzed the back nine with a five-under 31 which included four straight birdies. The Californian almost made it five on the last, only to see a 16-foot putt fall agonisingly short. Nevertheless, his four-shot lead is the biggest first-round advantage at Augusta since 1941. \"The putts started going in the hole - as simple as that sounds,\" he said. \"I kept hitting my spots and in the wind I ended up getting 20 footers and I got some of them down the stretch.\" McGirt, making his Masters debut, became the first player to break 70 with four birdies and a bogey in a three-under 69. The 37-year-old from South Carolina does not have much previous pedigree in the majors, having missed the cut at the US Open and The Open in 2016 before earning a 10th place finish at last year's PGA Championship. \"It was pretty darn special. Any time to break 70 is awesome,\" said McGirt, who is ranked a place below Hoffman at 53rd in the world. \"The few times I came down here to play in practice the wind direction was the same so this was not new to me today. \"I'm lucky enough to know a few members here and I've spoken to a few caddies and they've been happy to share their knowledge with me.\" Defending champion Willett headed a record 11 English players starting in the 93-strong field at Augusta, but made a nightmare start to his defence with a double bogey and a bogey in the opening two holes. Birdies on three and 10, with six successive pars sandwiched in-between, steadied the Yorkshireman's scorecard and a superb eagle on the par-five 13th moved him level par for the first time. However, a bogey on the 18th pushed him back over par. \"Battling back from three over even if it was flat and calm round this place would have been great,\" said the world number 17, who has not won a tournament since claiming the Green Jacket. \"We gathered ourselves after probably the worst start we could have wished for. A score of 73 seemed like a good score.\" On returning to the scene of his greatest triumph for the first time, he added: \"The memories came flooding back. To be anywhere defending a title is incredible but to be here at Augusta National is amazing - at least once in your life, but it would be nice to do it a couple of times.\" Willett became the first Englishman to win the Masters in 20 years when he overhauled Spieth 12 months ago, and a number of his compatriots are in close contention as they aim to repeat his feat. Fitzpatrick, the 22-year-old from Sheffield, led for a short period at three-under before a double bogey on the 18th dropped him back into the pack also containing Sullivan and Rose. Westwood, 43, surged into third place with five straight birdies on the back half as he continues his search for a first major title. World number two McIlroy, 27, is aiming to become only the sixth man to win all four majors - at his third time of trying at Augusta. McIlroy is seeking a first Masters title following victories at the US Open, the Open Championship and the US PGA Championship. And, after three consecutive top-10 finishes, he has made no secret that finally winning the Green Jacket is his main priority. The Northern Irishman made a scruffy start to his opening round, however, dropping three shots without making a birdie on the front nine. Gutsy par putts on 10, 11 and 12 prevented him dropping further adrift, setting the platform to haul himself back to level par with three birdies in the final six holes. \"After nine holes if someone had said I would shoot even par I would have ripped their hand off,\" he said. Two-time major winner Jordan Spieth is hoping to banish memories of last year's spectacular final-day collapse by winning his second Masters. The American, 23, led by five shots as he approached the 10th, only to dramatically drop six shots in three holes - including a quadruple bogey seven at the 12th - and allow England's Willett to take advantage. He was putting together an encouraging first round on Thursday until another quadruple bogey wrecked his card, although at three over par he is still in contention. Spieth was among the leaders heading into Amen Corner, coming through the tough trio of 11, 12 and 13 unscathed. He found the green on the iconic par-three 12th to huge cheers, then birdied the par-five 13th to move into a 13-man share of the lead at one under. \"I was relieved to see it down and on the green,\" he said of his tee shot on 12. \"And I guess everybody else felt maybe more than I did on it.\" But his opening-day challenge faded quickly as a bogey on the 14th was followed by a nine on the par-five 15th. Spieth's approach fizzed back off the green into the water and after taking a penalty drop, he knocked his fifth shot over the back, then hit a poor chip before needing three putts from 30 feet. \"It was nice to make a three at 12 and then four at the next,\" he added. \"I really thought we had it going there and just made a club choice mistake on 15 but we're still in the tournament.\" Belgium's Thomas Pieters - considered one of the rising stars on the European Tour - was one of the few players who managed to tame Augusta early on Thursday. He moved into an early four-shot lead on his Masters debut, rattling in five birdies in his opening 10 holes. Then, the 22-year-old came unstuck at Amen Corner. He signed for his first bogey at Augusta by three-putting on the 11th, but worse was soon to follow at the 12th. Pieters dunked his tee-shot into Rae's Creek - the water hazard guarding the narrow green - before knocking on and needing two putts for a double bogey. And another double bogey at the last dropped him back to level par alongside McIlroy, Ireland's Shane Lowry, England's Paul Casey and four-time major winner Ernie Els.

If that was happening in green-wellied Oxfordshire or the sharp-elbowed London boroughs there would have been a storming of the barricades. Howls of anguish would be rattling the windows of the Department for Education. There would be outrage about university places. Parents would want to know why their children had to fight for places in other authorities. There would be warnings about social mobility going into reverse and a great leap backwards. But in Knowsley the last school in the borough offering A-levels is planning to shut down its sixth form. The governing body of Halewood Academy voted last month to close the sixth form, pending a consultation that finished at the weekend. The academy says that its current sixth form is financially unviable. It says that the break-even point is 155 sixth formers - and although in 2011-12 it had 157, since then the numbers have been below this level and as such it is no longer affordable. The academy is proposing to stop taking new sixth formers from this autumn, with the assumption that pupils could travel to schools in other authorities. Many Knowsley pupils already go to schools in neighbouring authorities for their post-16 education, but it depends on such schools having places available. The local authority says that as this is an academy, they can't intervene. \"As an academy, it receives its funding direct from government and not from Knowsley council. \"Whilst we, as the local authority, do work with all our local academies to help them improve education standards, as an academy the school is ultimately accountable to the regional school commissioner, and not the local council.\" Parents have set up a protest page on Facebook, with comments about how difficult it is to get a clear answer from anyone about what is going on. \"Who is accountable? Nobody knows. Who do we get in touch with?\" says Vanessa Pointon, a parent at the school. \"This is letting down the children of this community. There are people who want to go to university, lots of kids who want to do well,\" she says. What kind of message does it send to young people to have no sixth forms offering A-levels? Knowsley already has among the lowest university entry rates in the country - and now young people are being told that none of their schools is even going to offer a single A-level. It is hard to think that since A-levels were introduced in the 1950s that there has ever been an authority where none of its schools offered the qualification. Sir Peter Lampl, chairman of the Sutton Trust, said: \"It is important that young people have the opportunity to access a good choice of A-levels wherever they live. \"For social mobility and access to Russell Group universities, this often means academic subjects like physics, chemistry, further maths and languages.\" Sir Peter said that despite funding challenges, it was \"crucial\" that \"such choices aren't curtailed\". The Knowsley example raises questions about how a future school system could operate where all schools are autonomous academies. If school decisions are outsourced to academy chains, who will provide an overview? There will be six secondary schools in Knowsley, a mix of academies and local authority schools, and if Halewood's proposal goes ahead, none of them would offer A-levels. Academy chains can operate across many different local authorities - and what works for them as a chain might not be the same as local interests. A Department for Education spokesman said ministers would be meeting MPs in Knowsley about the proposed sixth form closure. But the department says that if the school wants to push ahead with closure it will still have to be approved by education officials. \"It must make the case to the Education Funding Agency and the regional schools commissioner that post-16 provision in the area would not be adversely affected by the closure before it can be given permission to close it.\" Does this mean that the Department for Education will be able to intervene? This is where things are far from clear. Regional schools commissioners, appointed by the government, are the officials responsible for overseeing academies. They can intervene if academies are underperforming or where their governance is weak. But can they force an academy, or academy chain, to change what it teaches or the age groups? It's a far-reaching question, because what if regional schools commissioners were allowed to intervene and decide on matters such as admissions policies? Could they subsidise a sixth form that an individual academy could not afford? Could they change how schools select or who they admit? It's a political balancing act, because if they are bystanders, they will be dismissed as pointless. If they're given powers to intervene, including in good and outstanding schools, they will be attacked as bureaucrats trampling on parents' rights. The Education Select Committee has warned of a lack of clarity about the role of the regional schools commissioner and that they risked being seen as \"undemocratic and opaque\". They heard evidence that nine out of 10 parents did not understand what commissioners were meant to be doing. \"As we move towards a system of full academisation, the role of regional school commissioners will continue to grow and evolve,\" says the Department for Education. The government, setting out plans to compel all schools to become an academy, has called its White Paper \"Educational Excellence Everywhere\". But parents facing the prospect that none of their local schools will allow their children to take A-levels must wonder if \"everywhere\" means somewhere else.", "The Westgate development in the city centre will eventually have more than 100 shops, 25 restaurants and cafes, a cinema and 61 flats.

The Foxes fully deserved their victory, with Mignolet touching an Okazaki header onto the bar in the first half. Media playback is not supported on this device Leicester's title bid is unique in the Premier League age and with each victory, they move one game closer to winning their first ever top-flight title. There was a feeling the next two weeks could define Leicester's season - this game against Liverpool is followed by trips to title rivals Manchester City and Arsenal. But they came through the first of those three games in style. Vardy caught Mignolet off his line with his goal-of-the-season contender and then added a second 11 minutes later. The Foxes had most of the game's big chances, Mignolet brilliantly denying a Mahrez curling strike as well as touching Okazaki's effort onto the crossbar. Moments before Vardy's second, the hosts should have had a penalty when Mamadou Sakho brought down Okazaki. Foxes midfielder Danny Drinkwater said: \"We're staying on the ground but if we carry on the way we are then why not have the belief [to win the league]? It would go down in history surely.\" Vardy - who is set to sign a new three-and-a-half-year deal with the Foxes - had never scored a Premier League goal from outside the box with his first 21 top-flight attempts. He let Mahrez's long ball bounce before smashing it over Mignolet. After the game he revealed he had seen the keeper stray off his line on previous occasions and decided to try his luck. Leicester midfielder Drinkwater told BBC Match of the Day: \"His first goal was incredible. You think he's going to square it but he hits it top corner. It sums his season up. He can turn an average ball into a great ball.\" Leicester boss Claudio Ranieri said: \"Amazing. The first goal was unbelievable. Jamie is very fast and can create a lot but it was unbelievable how Mahrez found him and how he had the time to see the keeper out of the goal and score a fantastic goal.\" Media playback is not supported on this device Liverpool, who are now eighth and 16 points off top, look a long way from the side who beat Manchester City 4-1 and Southampton 6-1 in November and December.

Aslef said its members voted by almost nine to one to accept the deal, clearing another hurdle in plans for a Night Tube. The service was due to start on some lines at weekends last September but has been delayed because of failure to reach agreement with the unions over pay and conditions. Aslef officer Finn Brennan said union members' \"strength and solidarity have achieved an above-inflation pay rise and real improvements in conditions that will give drivers, and other grades, much more flexibility and control over their work-life balance\".

The dollar fell after US rates were held, which pushed commodity prices up.

Last week, growth for 2014 was up-rated to 3% from 2.1%, but will now be around 4.5%, Ireland's finance minister said. Michael Noonan said the economy was in \"a catch-up phase... after recession\". The year-on-year growth of 7.7% was the strongest recorded in Ireland since the early 2000s, Mr Noonan told reporters. By comparison, the eurozone recorded growth of just 0.7% over the same period. Along with Greece, Spain and Portugal, Ireland was among the eurozone's worst hit economies, with the bursting of its property bubble and soaring unemployment. The 1.5% quarterly rise beat the 0.5% expected by economists polled in a survey by the Reuters news agency. Mr Noonan said the faster growth would mean Ireland's budget deficit falling to about 3.5% of GDP this year against a target of 4.8%. That meant 2bn euros of tax rises and spending cuts planned for next year would no longer be needed to reach the EU limit of 3% by the end of 2015, he said. The economic improvement comes after years of austerity, a bailout from international lenders, and relentless austerity measures. \"At face value, the numbers suggest that the boom is back,\" said Austin Hughes, chief economist at KBC Bank Ireland. \"It shows a clearly improving economy.

He told the jury he had waved to Mr Lane, who did not wave back and had appeared to quicken his pace. He said: \"It felt strange, as if I had been ignored.\" Later, Mr Lane sent him a friendly text saying \"hi, how are you?\". A friend of Miss Grice, Joanne Pumfrey, also gave evidence, saying the victim had felt pressurised by Mr Lane and recounted a occasion when he had puller her hair in a pub. The prosecution asserts Mr Lane, of Thornhill Rise, Portslade, East Sussex, was \"obsessed\" with Miss Grice and refused to accept their break-up, or her new relationship with Ashley Cooke. It is alleged, after months of stalking her, he slit the teenager's throat before setting fire to her bedroom in Chrisdory Road, Portslade, in August.

Most women in Japan end up taking their husband's surname, a practice set to continue after Wednesday's ruling. But what do other countries do? In most well-populated countries, women are free to change their surname on marrying, if they wish. Many go further than that, putting in place laws stating that women do not have to change their names. France's law has been in place since the 18th century but, much like in Italy, there is some flexibility allowing wives to use their husband's surnames in an informal way. On all official paperwork, however, the maiden name must remain. The laws are much tougher in Greece and Quebec. In Greece, you must petition a court for a name change, and in Quebec, even if they wanted to, a wife cannot take her husband's surname at any point. In Iceland, women keep their maiden names after marriage. A surname is derived from a father's first name - so Bjork, Gudmund's daughter, becomes Bjork Gudmundsdottir - or, in certain circumstances, the mother's. A similar pattern is also followed in Ethiopia and Eritrea, where there is no concept of surnames as known in many Western countries. At birth, people are given one name, that is then followed by the father's name then the grandfather's name. Even after marrying, women retain their original three names. Could the Avatar actress Zoe Saldana and her husband Marco Perego - now Marco Saldana - be trend setters? The couple announced the move earlier this year, with Mrs Saldana calling her husband \"a man who stood by change\". In one case from 2012, however, a Mississippi man needed the help of the American Civil Liberties Union to take his wife's surname, having initially been prevented from changing the name on his driving licence.

To fund the giveaway, the chancellor capped debt interest payments used by larger firms to cut their corporation tax bills, to 30% of earnings. George Osborne also said corporation tax would be cut to 17% by 2020. Mr Osborne said his business tax reforms were part of a \"Budget for small business\". The chancellor announced he was permanently raising the threshold for small business rate relief from \u00a36,000 to a maximum of \u00a315,000 and increasing higher rate relief from \u00a318,000 to \u00a351,000. He said that the 600,000 small businesses relieved of paying business rates from next April would see an annual saving of nearly \u00a36,000. Mike Cherry, policy director at the Federation of Small Businesses, said: \"The chancellor has listened to our calls for the tax system to be made simpler for small businesses and the self-employed and taken important action on business rates.\" The chancellor also announced a number of reforms designed to help small businesses cope with what he called \"the great unfairness\" they faced when trying to compete with some suppliers selling goods online. Mr Osborne said the government would take measures to stop overseas retailers storing goods in the UK and then selling the goods online without paying VAT. He also introduced two new tax-free allowances worth \u00a31,000 a year for so-called micro-entrepreneurs:  people who make money from occasional jobs or through renting out property they own. The Treasury estimates that the debt interest rate relief cap, alongside other measures, will help raise \u00a38bn over the next five years. Among those other measures was the announcement that firms making an annual profit of over \u00a35m would face the prospect of having the amount of past losses they could carry forward to offset their corporation tax bill capped to 50% of current profits. Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI business lobby group, said: \"The reduction in the headline corporation tax rate sends out a strong signal that the UK is open for global business investment, and reforms to interest deductibility are rightly in line with the international consensus.

Education Minister Huw Lewis said there were concerns over \"unusual student recruitment trends\". The college said as far as it is concerned, all of its students are genuine. The Cardiff branch runs various IT and business courses and has been designated as suitable to offer HND business courses, which attract tuition fees of \u00c2\u00a36,000 per student, funded by the Welsh government. Students on those courses can also apply for Student Finance Wales loans and grants. Week In Week Out has been investigating offers made by a local agent recruiting for the college. Some students have been told by him they can use faked documents to access those loans and grants and they do not have to attend regularly to get the cash. He also said if they do not go on to earn more than \u00c2\u00a321,000, they will not have to repay the money - which is true. The college has denied any knowledge of that scam. In a statement to AMs on Friday, Mr Lewis said: \"Allegations have since come to light to suggest that one or more individuals within the college may have colluded with prospective students deliberately to defraud the student finance system by falsifying academic records and records of attendance at the college. \"I would expect any allegations of criminal activity to be referred to the police so that they may be investigated fully.\" Pearson UK - which validates colleges - carried out a review of the Cardiff campus, visiting the site on 21 October. The education minister said that \"no substantive concerns came to light at that time\".", "The inquiry into the University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Trust found 20 major failures from 2004 to 2013 at Furness General Hospital. It called the avoidable incidents \"serious and shocking\". And it criticised the wider NHS for the way it had monitored and regulated events at the hospital. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said in the House of Commons that the tragedy was \"a second Mid Staffs\", albeit on a smaller scale. In an echo of the inquiries in the Stafford Hospital scandal, the independent report said the problems found represented a \"simultaneous failure of a great many systems at almost every level, from labour ward to the headquarters of national bodies\". Mr Hunt made number of recommendations, saying that the tragedy \"must strengthen our resolve to deliver real and lasting culture change so these mistakes are never repeated.\" He has appointed Dr Mike Durkin, National Director of Patient Safety at NHS England, to draw up new guidelines about reporting serious incidents as well as establish an independent national team that can go on rapid fact finding missions on a \"no blames basis\" as soon as issues arise. And he's asked Prof Sir Bruce Keogh, Medical Director of NHS England, to review the professional codes of conduct for doctors and nurses to ensure mistakes are reported, not covered up. The investigation - led by Dr Bill Kirkup, a former senior Department of Health official - found: Despite the failures starting in 2004 and continuing throughout the period, including a cluster of five major incidents in 2008, it was only in 2011 that the issues at Furness General came to wider attention. This was after strong criticism from a coroner who looked into the death of newborn Joshua Titcombe. The coroner ruled Joshua had died of natural causes in 2008 but midwives had repeatedly missed opportunities to spot and treat a serious infection. Around this time, a report came to light that the trust itself had commissioned. It was produced in early 2010 but \"suppressed\" by the trust. But before that, the trust had failed to act on earlier incidents and even distorted the way information was presented to inquests. Who was failed at Furness? The CQC, regional health authority and ombudsman had not acted properly on what they knew either.  There was knowledge of five major incidents in 2009 as the trust had revealed them as part of its application for foundation trust status, which is reserved for elite trusts. But the regulators did not take the necessary action to fully investigate what had happened, and the trust gained foundation status in September 2010. Dr Kirkup said: \"This was a disturbing catalogue of missed opportunities.\" His inquiry makes 44 recommendations, including: Six midwives are already due before the NMC later this year - and a seventh is being investigated. Meanwhile, a police investigation into the death of Joshua Titcombe is continuing, and the Health and Safety Executive is looking into the case. Pearse Butler, chair of the Morecambe Bay Trust, said: \"The trust has made some very serious mistakes. \"More than that the same mistakes were repeated. For these reasons, on behalf of the trust, I apologise unreservedly to the families concerned. I am deeply sorry that so many people have suffered.\" She said the trust would look to learn the lessons of what went wrong. She said there was a new leadership team in place and extra staff had already been taken on. Parent power prompted midwife review James Titcombe's son Joshua was nine days old when he died of sepsis. He was born at Furness General Hospital and was transferred to two other hospitals before dying in Newcastle. \"We asked repeatedly if Joshua should have antibiotics and we were told 'No, he didn't [need any]',\" said Mr Titcombe. \"He was wheezing, and he wasn't feeding properly, and my wife called the emergency bell because he was grunting. \"And every time, we were told Joshua was fine and that there was nothing to worry about. At no stage was a doctor ever called.\" Afterwards Joshua's progress chart went missing, never to re-emerge, and the coroner later said there was a suspicion that it may have been deliberately destroyed. On the report's publication, Mr Titcombe said: \"I think I feel deeply sad, angry as well, and vindicated, all at the same time. \"For me this report really lays out how preventable Joshua's death was. I really recognise now when we talk about missed opportunities in this report, that for me means not having a six-year-old.\"", "The American city, linked to sportswear firm Nike, was given the event by the IAAF without a bidding process, a decision being investigated in France. Gothenburg, which missed out, described the process as \"bad ethics\". But Eugene said it \"adhered to all ethical and legal standards for organizing, presenting and advocating for our bid, according to IAAF rules\". Media playback is not supported on this device IAAF president and former vice-president Lord Coe severed his links to Nike after questions over his role in the decision. But in a statement Eugene said it had submitted identical bids for the 2019 and 2021 World Championships, losing out to Doha in 2019. It added: \"The decision to award the 2021 World Championships to Eugene was made by the IAAF Council in a vote of 23-1.\" French officials are already investigating corruption allegations involving former IAAF president Lamine Diack, with Coe quitting the Nike payroll two days after a BBC story suggested he had held talks with Diack and Nike about the awarding of the 2021 event. Coe, who was reportedly paid \u00a3100,000 a year by Nike, said at the time that he \"did not lobby anyone\" over Eugene's bid, but simply \"encouraged them to re-enter another bidding cycle as they had a strong bid\". Gothenburg bid chief Bjorn Erikkson said awarding the World Championships to Eugene had made him \"really upset and for very good reasons\". He told BBC World Service: \"What happened is bad ethics at least and definitely not professional. \"In the worst of cases it's maybe also criminal, if somebody were there influencing the process, and that's a question that I really want a good answer to.\" The former police officer also said he was not sure if Gothenburg would re-enter the bidding process, should it be re-opened. \"It's up to the Gothenburg people, they don't want to answer that question until they know why the last procedure was so unacceptable,\" he told BBC World Service. \"If you are going to make business with these people you wish to know if they are professional, honest and serious, otherwise maybe you don't want to do business at all.\" Coe said that awarding a World Championships without a bidding process \"was not without precedence\" - the 2007 World Championships in Osaka was one such occasion. But Erikkson described that as \"nonsense\". He added: \"If you behave idiotically and unacceptably is it better if you do it twice rather than once? Secondly there are no arguments for doing this, because we who are engaged in the sport wished to have a transparent process, to do it in disguise is not acceptable.\"", "The attacks, occurring from 2011 to 2013, are believed to have been co-ordinated from Iranian companies. The US Department of Justice revealed an indictment against the seven, believed to be working for their government in Iran. The indictment calls them \"experienced computer hackers\" and officials said the attacks were a \"wake-up call\". It is the first time the US is charging people associated with a national government with hacking into US infrastructure for major industries like finance and water. The attacks \"threatened our economic well-being and our ability to compete fairly in the global marketplace - both of which are directly linked to our national security,\" said US Attorney General Loretta Lynch. \"And we believe that they were conducted with the sole purpose of undermining the targeted companies and damaging the online operation of America's free market.\" Mrs Lynch said the attacks cost the victims tens of millions of dollars. Ahmad Fathi, Hamid Firoozi, Amin Shokohi, Sadegh Ahmadzadegan, Omid Ghaffarinia, Sina Keissar and Nader Seidi are identified in the indictment as the alleged attackers. The charges carry a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison for conspiracy to commit and aid and abet computer hacking. It is almost certain that Iran will not send the accused to the US, and they have not been arrested. The indictment is still important, said FBI director James Comey. \"The world is small, and our memories are long,\" he said. \"We never say never. People often like to travel for vacation or education, and we want them looking over their shoulder.\"", "The male in his early 30s was found with critical injuries in North Woolwich Road, Silvertown, at about 13:30 GMT. He was pronounced dead at the scene and inquiries are under way to locate his next-of-kin, the Met said. No arrests have been made. Two other cyclists were killed in the capital within hours of each other on Monday. Anita Szucs, 30, died after an apparent hit-and-run on Bounces Road, Enfield, while Karla Roman, 32, was killed in a crash with a coach on Whitechapel High Street, Tower Hamlets.", "Thousands of sufferers and their dependants will be able to get damages from a \u00a3350m pot over the next decade. Those diagnosed after 25 July 2012 and who cannot sue former employers as they have gone bust or insurance details have disappeared will be eligible. Ministers said it was a \"major breakthrough\" to \"end an injustice\". Mesothelioma is a fatal disease with average survival rates of about nine months after diagnosis. It is most prevalent among those who worked in industries with heavy exposure to asbestos up to the 1980s, including construction, shipbuilding, engineering and power generation. About 2,400 people die every year of the disease and numbers are set to increase over the next 30 years, with an estimated death toll of between 56,000 and 63,000. While some people have taken legal action to recover damages, many are deterred because of the stress involved. The speed with which the disease takes hold means many die before their cases are heard. Victims and their families have, up to now, been able to claim damages under two pieces of legislation but the sums paid have not generally exceeded \u00a320,000. Under the proposed new fund, which must receive parliamentary approval, UK claimants will be entitled to 75% of the average settlement paid out in civil actions relating to mesothelioma, expected to be about \u00a3115,000. Claimants will have to demonstrate that they were negligently exposed to asbestos at work and are unable to claim compensation because they cannot track down a liable employer or insurer. \"This scheme represents a major breakthrough for the many victims of this terrible disease, who have been failed by successive governments and the insurance industry for decades,\" said Work and Pensions Minister Mike Penning. \"It will end an injustice that has left many tragic victims and their families high and dry. \"The aggressive and terminal nature of this disease, coupled with the fact we're approaching a peak in cases in the coming years, makes it imperative that we get this legislation in place as soon as possible,\" he added. According to government calculations, 900 people are likely to qualify for support in 2014, with a further 300 expected to get assistance in each of the following nine years. If the Mesothelioma Bill currently before Parliament is passed in the next few months, it is hoped the first payments will be made next July. There has been anger that ministers have proposed a cut-off point for claims and that those diagnosed before 25 July last year, when the scheme was first announced, will not be eligible. Officials have defended the move, saying that an open-ended commitment to compensate all those afflicted by the disease would simply not be affordable. Those suffering from other asbestos-related conditions, such as asbestosis, will also not be eligible. One campaign group said the proposals were a \"drastic improvement\" on the current support available. But it said the cut-off point seemed \"arbitrary and harsh\" and some victims felt it was unfair that they were not able to claim 100% of the value of a civil settlement. Mesothelioma often takes 40 to 50 years to manifest itself after exposure and most of those being diagnosed are males in their 60s and older. The scheme will be paid for by the insurance industry. All insurers will have to register on a voluntary database established in 2011 listing employers' liability insurance policies, both current and historic.", "The cases involve 165 suspects and more than 100 victims. A police spokesperson said many cases had \"multiple suspects and multiple victims\" but there was also a large number involving single suspects. Last year, 12 men were jailed for their part in the abuse of a single victim in Keighley. Eleven were jailed at Bradford Crown Court after being convicted of raping the girl from the age of 13 and another man was sentenced for sexual activity with her. The CSE figures, which were given to the Keighley News and confirmed to the BBC by police, compare with last year's figure of 220 cases. There were 261 suspects under investigation at the same time in 2016. A police spokesperson said: \"West Yorkshire Police and partners have been proactive in their approach to encourage victims to come forward and reassure them that all reports will be taken seriously. \"We have developed a far greater understanding of CSE than in the past and this has led to rapid action to prioritise resources to improve the identification and prosecution of perpetrators of this abhorrent crime.\"", "His daughter said he had died at Val de Grace military hospital in Paris on Tuesday evening. Raymond Aubrac and his late wife Lucie became important members of Jean Moulin's underground Resistance movement in 1942. Aubrac was arrested in June 1943 with Moulin, who died after torture. In a recent BBC interview, he described how their arrests by the Gestapo at a doctor's surgery in the suburb of Caluire in Lyon had come as \"a shock but not a surprise\". Jean Moulin, who had been sent by Gen Charles de Gaulle to organise the underground resistance to Nazi occupation, was tortured, taken to Paris and later died on a train to Berlin. But Raymond Aubrac escaped when a group of fighters including his wife attacked a lorry moving him and other members of the Resistance from jail in Lyon. Born as Raymond Samuel in 1914, Aubrac was Jewish. He studied engineering and married Lucie Bernard after war broke out. After his escape from jail, the couple reached London in February 1944. Their story and their Resistance work with Jean Moulin became legendary in France and the couple gave a number of talks to schools and colleges about their experience. After France was liberated, Aubrac was given the task of supervising reconstruction efforts in the port city of Marseille. From 1964-75 he served as a director at the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome. He twice gave evidence after the war against Rene Hardy, a fellow Resistance member who was accused of betraying his colleagues but was later acquitted. In 2010, he travelled to London with President Nicolas Sarkozy to commemorate the 70th anniversary of Gen de Gaulle's appeal to the French people after the country had fallen to the Nazis. Raymond Aubrac remained politically active until he died and gave his backing to Socialist presidential candidate Francois Hollande. In tribute, President Sarkozy described him as an \"heroic figure\" whose \"escape, thanks to the courage of his wife Lucie Aubrac, has entered into the legend of Resistance history\". Centrist presidential candidate Francois Bayrou praised him as a \"major emblematic figure\".", "The oil painting was commissioned by Royal Northern Sinfonia, which wants to challenge the Austrian's \"chocolate box\" portrayal, ahead its new season. \"Somehow we've come to think of his music as pretty,\" said the orchestra's music director Lars Vogt. \"But that music is often dramatic and dark. Those qualities must have been there in the man.\" The portrait was painted by renowned American artist Tim O'Brien, and will be projected onto buildings around the orchestra's home towns of Newcastle and Gateshead over the coming months. Regarded as one of the greatest composers of all time, Mozart wrote more than 600 works, including some of the most celebrated and enduring pieces of classical music, before he died at the age of 35. Only 14 images of the composer are known to have been created during his lifetime, but many are stylised or incomplete. The best physical description came from baritone Luigi Bassi, for whom Mozart had written the role of Don Giovanni. \"Mr Mozart was an extremely eccentric and absent-minded young man, but not without a certain spirit of pride,\" he said. \"He was very popular with the ladies, in spite of his small size; but he had a most unusual face, and he could cast a spell on any woman with his eyes.\" Describing the existing portraits as \"cosy and pretty\", O'Brien explained the thinking behind his new painting. \"I know of few musicians of real depth where you can't see some of that complexity in the face.  So to find the Mozart who was obsessively driven, who pushed boundaries and who lived in a world where harsh poverty and crime were a very real facts, I looked at musicians from our own era to provide some inspiration. \"Photos of Johnny Cash and Eric Clapton suggested both obsession and some kind of danger. Johnny Rotten provided a certain precocious brilliance, and I related to those for Mozart.\" O'Brien previously made headlines by creating a portrait of Beethoven for the cover of Gramophone magazine, which was inspired by U2 singer Bono. The portrait accompanies the Northern Sinfonia's new season, which includes a series of concerts called Reclaiming Mozart. They begin on Friday, 18 September with the first movement of Mozart's Symphony No. 25, and will also include his Clarinet Concerto and the rarely performed Symphony No. 33. Musical director Vogt will be the soloist in the Quintet for Piano and Wind, of which Mozart once wrote: \"I myself consider it to be the best thing I have written in my life.\" The German concert pianist and conductor, who recently played the first night of the Proms, is an avowed Mozart fan - whose desert island disc would be a box set of the composer's works. In his first season as director of the Sinfonia, he plans to stage a number of \"pop-up\" concerts in venues that echo the \"darker corners of Vienna\" that Mozart would have frequented in the 18th Century.", "A section of the audience laughed when Owen Smith - who is challenging Mr Corbyn for the Labour leadership - said Ms Dugdale was doing a \"brilliant job\". Ms Dugdale, who was not at the debate, has backed Mr Smith's campaign for the leadership. But Mr Corbyn said he did not think anyone should be jeered. It comes as allies of Mr Corbyn dismissed claims they could seek to remove Ms Dugdale if Mr Corbyn wins the leadership contest. Speaking in Edinburgh on Friday, Mr Corbyn said: \"I don't think anyone should jeer at anyone else. I don't do that myself and have asked other people not to and made it very, very clear - let's have an honest, open and respectful debate.\" Mr Corbyn insisted \"the Scottish party is not going to split off from the UK party\", and said he would continue to work with Ms Dugdale despite her support for Mr Smith. But he said it was \"a matter for the Scottish Labour party\" whether Ms Dugdale faced a leadership challenge in the future. Mr Corbyn added: \"I'll be happy to work with her after this election and we will work together because we're in the same party, we're in the Labour Party, we want to see a better society.\" Earlier, former Labour advisor Paul Sinclair claimed in an interview with BBC Scotland that Ms Dugdale could face a challenge from her deputy, Alex Rowley, if Mr Corbyn continues as UK Labour leader. Mr Rowley is backing Mr Corbyn in the leadership contest, as is former Scottish Labour leadership candidate Neil Findlay. But Mr Rowley insisted a leadership challenge was \"absolutely not on the cards\" and said suggestions he wanted to replace Ms Dugdale as leader were \"rubbish\". And Mr Findlay said there was \"absolutely no way\" he would consider standing again, adding that Ms Dugdale had a \"very large mandate to lead the Scottish Labour party\". Thursday evening's debate saw Mr Smith claim Labour had \"gone backwards\" in Scotland under Mr Corbyn, with the party finishing third behind the SNP and Conservatives in May's Holyrood election. Mr Corbyn said the party had to do more to challenge the \"austerity\" of the SNP government, but admitted Labour was facing a \"big fight ahead and a long road back\". Mr Smith is attempting to unseat Mr Corbyn less than a year after he was overwhelmingly elected as leader. The leadership contest was triggered after dozens of Mr Corbyn's frontbench team - including then-Work and Pensions spokesman Mr Smith - quit in the wake of Hilary Benn's sacking on 26 June. The result is due to be announced on 24 September.", "In Dublin, a military ceremonial event was held at the War Memorial Gardens at Islandbridge. A military service was also held at the Mall in Cork. Irish President Michael D Higgins travelled to Thiepval in France to pay tribute to the Irishmen who died while serving in the British, Commonwealth or US armies. He was accompanied by the the Irish minister for arts, heritage and the Gaeltacht, Heather Humphreys. The village of Thiepval in France is close to where the 36th Ulster Division began their attack on German lines on 1 July 1916 and is now the site of the Ulster Memorial Tower, a 70ft (21m) monument which commemorates their sacrifice. Men from all over the island of Ireland fought at the Somme, and the service in France will also be attended by representatives from the British and French governments also. Many people from the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, including relatives of Somme veterans, have travelled to Thiepval for the commemoration event. The ceremony in Dublin began at 07:28 local time - the time the battle started 100 years ago. It was attended by members of the Irish Defence Forces and the Royal British Legion.", "Carnival had said in March that the sinking of its Costa Concordia cruises ship in January could wipe out profits this year as people shunned cruises. However, on Tuesday the firm reported that profits were $1.33bn (\u00c2\u00a3819m) in the third quarter, compared with $1.34bn in the same period last year. Shares in the firm in New York rose more than 3%. Thirty-two people died in the shipwreck in January, which an official report blamed the captain of the Costa Concordia for causing, as well as assigning some responsibility to Costa, which is owned by Carnival. The Costa Concordia still lies next to the rocky outcrops off Giglio Island in Italy's Tuscan coast. Carnival said it had managed to generate more money from its cruise passengers. \"The significant efforts of our brand management teams were successful in partially mitigating the decline in cruise ticket prices,\" said chairman and chief executive Micky Arison. The company also plans to focus on emerging markets. \"For 2013, the company will capitalise on the increasing popularity of cruising in Asia with the deployment of a second Costa ship in China and the launch of a new Princess Cruises program for the Japanese market,\" it said. Costa Cruises is a subsidiary of Carnival and runs some of the company's total fleet of 100 ships. Other brands include Carnival, P&O, Cunard, Holland America, Princess and Seabourn.", "The new bill, which would affect digital maps from Google, Apple, and Uber, is facing stiff opposition from campaign groups. It also bans \"wrong\" information, including disputed international borders. The government said the rules would not create barriers to business if the bill became law. The bill bans all types of geospatial information, maps, raw data or photographs, acquired by any means, including satellite photography. Offenders could be fined up to 1bn rupees (\u00c2\u00a310.4m). It also requires anyone who has already gathered such information to apply for a licence to keep it. It was designed to regulate both the creation and distribution of geospatial information in India \"which is likely to affect the security, sovereignty and integrity\" of the country, the Ministry of Home Affairs said. Critics say the definition of geospatial data is so wide it could include printed maps, world atlases, or depictions of the country in international magazines imported to India. The proposed law is likely to cause problems for Apple and Google's map products, as well as services offering \"value added\" geolocation services, such as taxi-hailing app Uber. It is also unclear if companies such as Google would have to go through a separate vetting process every time they updated their satellite imagery - a process that takes up to three months. There is an exemption for government agencies and departments. Google already offers slightly altered versions of its maps inside India, eliminating the Line of Control that divides Indian-controlled and Pakistan-controlled Kashmir and locating the whole disputed region within India's borders. Both Google and Uber declined to comment. The laws extend beyond large international companies. Anyone creating, distributing, or owning unsanctioned maps must apply to a government agency for a licence, and submit the material for inspection. The geospatial data will then be considered by a security vetting committee, which will decide if the applicant is granted a licence. Once the material is cleared, it must be watermarked with the insignia of the vetting authority. \"It's only a draft proposal before the country,\" the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Kiren Rijiju, said in a tweet. \"I would appeal not to pass hasty judgment, but put up your suggestions.\" Speaking to the Economic Times, he said: \"It is a general concern being raised that India as a responsible country must have provisions to secure its boundary and territory. \"That is why the bill is necessary. \"It is not a question of sending a message to any firm or company - but it is a question of addressing our own security concern.\" In a country where the number of people owning a mobile phone is rocketing, providing online maps is a big and growing business. If this bill goes through, no-one, from Google to the smallest business, will be able to run their map services in India without a licence. The government will control how anyone uses online maps. When I want to book a cab using a taxi app service, I'm sharing my location with the service to find a cab. The driver uses a map to navigate. When I take a picture and upload it with metadata, I'm creating mapping information that would require a licence. A growing protest online, with the hashtag \"#savethemap\", claims the bill won't just hurt individuals, but also small businesses. Campaigner Sumandro Chattapadhyay says companies such as Uber and Google will survive by getting all their maps vetted by the government. \"But smaller companies have no means to know what kind of geospatial information they can store and what they cannot,\" she says. \"Moreover, if a start-up requires three months to get approvals for your data before you can use it, it'll be as good as dead.\" The bill also bans the publication of such material outside the country, and is designed to apply to citizens of India living and working in other countries, explicitly stating offenders outside India will be subject to the same penalties. \"This act needs to be dropped,\" said managing editor Arup Dasgupta, in a post on Geospatial World magazine's website. \"This act does not, in fact cannot, even begin to comprehend the paradigm shift in geospatial technologies which makes it a non-starter. \"India does need a geospatial information act, but it has to be an enabling and encouraging act that makes for faster and better implementation of programmes, not a regressive and punitive act as the proposed one,\" he said. The bill is still in the draft stage, and government is inviting submissions on it until 4 June.", "But just north of the small market town of Korem, bright green fields and neatly terraced hillsides surround a vast lake, and in the brand new local hospital, the ward reserved for severely malnourished babies is all but empty. Foreign aid is a notoriously difficult business - and much criticised. But if you're looking for results, then this vast climate-change challenged country, led by a hugely ambitious and severely authoritarian government, is worth a visit. In the first decade of this century, the number of Ethiopians living in poverty dropped by a third. In the last five years, child mortality has come down by two-thirds. There's good reason to expect the trend will continue. \"Two years ago - before the hospital was built - this baby would have died,\" said a young doctor, Betgel Mekonnen, as nurses fed an emaciated one year old with fortified milk. \"We are grateful to Britain and the international community for their help, but I think we'll [become self-sufficient] in five or 10 years,\" he said. It's a sense of confidence one hears often in a country whose economy has been growing at close to 10% a year for a decade. 227 child deaths per 1,000 in 1984; 64 in 2013 GDP growth in 1984: -2.85% (a fall); 10.5% in 2013 GDP per head in 1984: $205;$568 in 2014 Population in 1984; 39.5 million;96.5 million in 2014 Source: The World Bank Ethiopia profile Is Ethiopia's building boom masking poverty? Have UK businesses missed the train in Ethiopia? This week a big conference in Ethiopia's fast-growing capital, Addis Ababa, will discuss ways to finance ambitious new international development goals - with a growing focus on improving local tax collection, and fighting illicit capital flight, across Africa. For now, British taxpayers are giving over \u00c2\u00a3300m ($466m) a year to help fight poverty in Ethiopia. \"This is a place where you can see your money achieving something,\" said Tim Conway, who works in Ethiopia for the UK's Department for International Development (DfID). \"Development processes always create winners and losers, but the vast majority are sharing in the growth. We've learnt not to question [the government's] ambition too much because they've quite often exceeded what we thought was possible,\" he said. But Ethiopia, like tiny nearby Rwanda, poses some difficult questions for democratic countries with good intentions. Both nations have achieved remarkable economic growth in the context of an often highly repressive form of governance. Critics accuse donors of quietly ignoring human rights abuses, or even of indirectly sustaining them. Mr Conway acknowledged there were a lot of \"hard arguments\" with Ethiopia's government, and \"there are policies we don't support, and won't\". But he praised a bilateral partnership that \"is really quite effective\". The clear hope, on both sides, is that with the right, sustainable, projects Ethiopia can wean itself off foreign aid within the foreseeable future. Near the small hillside village of Bahari Hatsra just outside Korem, we found 40-year-old Admassie Mekonen walking home with a simple wooden plough on his shoulder, after a day's work on the small field he rents. For the past four years he, his wife and 10-year-old daughter have benefited from a partly British-funded programme that pays Mr Admassie a monthly wage of about \u00c2\u00a320 ($31) during the six-month \"food gap\" season before harvest, when the family has exhausted its supplies. In return, he works on a variety of public projects, chosen by the community - terracing the hillsides, for example, to prevent soil erosion. The programme is a part of a recent shift away from giving foreign aid money to support individual governments, and instead to put it directly in the hands of the poor. \"It's hundreds of thousands of man-hours every year... it's restored the landscape,\" said Mr Conway. But the challenges ahead remain significant. Ethiopia's population is heading towards 100 million, with a quarter still living in extreme poverty. Sitting down in front of his simple wood and mud home, Mr Admassie said the cash payments had, at times, saved his family from starvation. But he questioned whether he would ever be able to manage without them. \"I don't own any land. I rent my fields. I have to give half the crop to the owner as payment. \"I can work hard now, but I worry about what will happen when I get older. I will have to go to the city to find work,\" he said.", "The soldiers from the 2 Scots battalion of the Royal Regiment of Scotland are being sent to Kabul to help train the Afghan army. The last British combat troops left Helmand province in October last year. The Scots soldiers are due to leave from their barracks in Penicuik sometime next month, with their deployment expected to last for seven months. The soldiers have completed months of intensive training. About 250 soldiers will be based in the Afghan army college near Kabul. Their role will be to assist in the training of Afghan army soldiers and officers as part of Operation Toral, the ongoing British mission to support Afghan security forces. Lt Col Graham Wearmouth, of 2 Scots Battalion, said the troops will be there in a very different capacity to their previous combat role in Helmand. \"I think it is all comparative,\" he said. \"You've got to look at what went before and yes, it is not without risk of course, and as a British soldier deploying on an operation overseas you would expect that. \"But it feels very, very different and we are not the ones who are primarily in the lead. \"It is the Afghans in the lead. We are there in a supporting role, helping them to develop their institutions so that they can then deliver more enduring stability to their own country.\" More than 450 British servicemen and women lost their lives in the 13 year conflict in Afghanistan.", "Two hundred and sixty people have already been convicted. The officer in charge of Operation Titan, Det Supt Sean Wright, appealed for anyone taking part in planned protests later this month to do so lawfully and peacefully. Operation Titan was set-up to investigate public order-related incidents since 12 July. Police released the figures at a press conference at PSNI headquarters in Belfast on Monday. ACC Will Kerr said 2013 had been a challenging year for policing. He said the last four years had seen a severe dissident republican threat, however recently there had been an upsurge in activity. In relation to the loyalist paramilitary group, the UVF, ACC Kerr said that elements of the group, particularly in east Belfast, had been involved in a range of criminal activity, however the issue of respecification was a political decision.", "Sky Mobile will offer flexible monthly payment plans and the ability to roll over unused data each month for up to three years. Sky will become a \"quad play\" provider, offering broadband, television fixed-line telephone and a mobile service. And existing Sky TV customers will not have to pay for calls or texts and can compile playlists of their favourite shows to watch on their mobiles. According to Sky, some 46,000 have pre-registered for the service. The service comes with three data plans: Non-Sky TV customers can add on unlimited calls and texts for \u00a310 per month, or pay for calls and texts on a pay-as-you-use (PAYU) basis. According to Sky, UK consumers use less than half of the mobile data they buy from mobile network operators, adding up to an annual \u00a32bn of wasted data. Stephen van Rooyen, UK and Ireland Sky chief executive, said:  \"We felt it was time to shake up the mobile market and give customers a completely new way to manage their mobile plan. \"We've designed it based on what people told us they want - it's easy, flexible and transparent and it puts the customer in control.\" Ewan Taylor-Gibson, a telecoms expert at uSwitch said: \"Sky's first mobile offering is very competitive, as long as you're already a Sky TV customer.\" He compared Sky's Sim-only deal with that already offered by giffgaff, another service that piggybacks on O2's network and allows customers to alter their package depending on their usage. \"The key differences between the two are that Sky ties you in for 12 months, while giffgaff users can cancel anytime, and giffgaff also offers unlimited everything for \u00a320 a month, beating Sky's top package, which delivers 5GB,\" said Mr Taylor-Gibson. Sky's decision to let people roll over data and store it for three years was \"both unique and compelling\", he said, but it may have to offer bigger data bundles.", "Core earnings fell 41% to $1.59bn (\u00c2\u00a31.03bn), with pre-tax profits down to $708m from $1.9bn a year earlier.

This being the Olympics, Van der Breggen didn't think of stopping but rode on to win the gold instead. But this interview didn't take place from said hospital, or even a different one in the Netherlands. Two weeks after the crash that was heard around the world, Van Vleuten was on her bike again. Never mind the three fractures in her back, the severe concussion, the worried mum, there were other races to be won. \"The first week I was really struggling with the idea that I was going for gold and made that stupid, stupid mistake. But then I realised that thinking like this was not going to help me feel better. So I started making some new goals. \"The three vertebrae were not broken in a dangerous place in my back, only on the side, and I never had serious symptoms of the concussion. And as a cyclist you're used to crashing at least once or twice a year, it's part of the job.\" Almost a month to the day after her Olympic hopes hit the skids, Van Vleuten won her first stage, the Belgium Tour prologue. Three days later, Van Vleuten clinched the overall title with a stirring solo effort on the final stage. \"It's sort of a miracle but I sort of expected it,\" said Van der Breggen, apparently a difficult woman to stir. \"She is really tough. That is Annemiek.\" A tough talker, too. Asked how she felt when she heard Britain's Lizzie Deignan (nee Armitstead) had been cleared to compete in the Olympic road race, having missed three drug tests in a year, Van Vleuten goes for the jugular. \"I was angry about it because the rules are for everyone and you cannot make exceptions. It's part of the job, you have to take it seriously. It's very special to miss three tests in one year, a really big achievement. Maybe because she's the world champion they made an exception for her but I don't think that's fair.\" Van Vleuten is similarly outspoken on the subject of inequality in cycling, advocating that every men's race should have a women's equivalent. \"What would help is if we had more time on television. That would help to get more sponsors and more people to watch and enjoy it. The [women's] Rio road race was a good example of that, it was at the same level as the men's race.\" At the current rate, equality will arrive in cycling long after Van Vleuten has pedalled her last and hung her bikes up. Female cyclists earn a fraction of what male cyclists pull in and the chance to ride one day of the Tour de France is little more than a patronising pat on the head from the cycling authorities. But just as Van Vleuten doesn't like to look over her shoulder, she doesn't like to look too far forward. It makes a lot of sense, given what happened in Rio. \"After the London Olympics I wasn't only thinking of Rio. Cycling has a lot of nice races, like the Tour of Flanders [which Van Vleuten won in 2011 and Armitstead this year], which is a super-beautiful race to win. I just see things one day at a time and year by year.\" Next for Van Vleuten is the World Championships in Qatar, which run from this Sunday and in which she will compete alongside Van der Breggen in the team time trial and the road race. Expected to compete against the clock in temperatures pushing 40C, it's good that she can look on the bright side. \"It's hard for me to do interviews that always want to talk about the crash because it's something I've accepted and I don't want to look back at that. \"I prefer to think about the part before, the part when I was going uphill and riding so excellent, better than I ever did. That part was nice to watch back again. I'm proud of what I did, that day in Rio was really special.\" Follow coverage of the World Road Championships from 9-16 October across the BBC.", "On Wednesday the US Congress voted for a law allowing families of nearly 3,000 people killed in the attacks to sue. In doing so they overrode a veto by President Barack Obama, who said it would set a \"dangerous precedent\". Fifteen of the 19 hijackers that day were Saudi nationals, but the kingdom has denied any role in the attacks. In a statement, the country's foreign ministry said: \"The erosion of sovereign immunity will have a negative impact on all nations, including the United States.\" The 9/11 bill row, explained Their argument parallels the one made by Mr Obama. He said on CNN after the vote that the law set a \"dangerous precedent\" and could lead to the US being opened to \"a situation where we're suddenly exposed to liabilities for all the work that we're doing all around the world and suddenly finding ourselves subject to private lawsuits\". Meanwhile, leaders of the Republican party in Congress have said they want to reconsider the law. The Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell admitted that lawmakers had not understood the possible consequences of the legislation. \"Everybody was aware of who the potential beneficiaries were but nobody really had focused on the downside in terms of our international relationships,'\" Mr McConnell said. The White House spokesman Josh Earnest said it was \"a pretty classic case of rapid onset buyer's remorse\". On CNN, Mr Obama also suggested that that voting patterns in Congress were influenced by political concerns. \"If you're perceived as voting against 9/11 families right before an election, not surprisingly, that's a hard vote for people to take,\" he said. \"But it would have been the right thing to do.\" Saudi Arabia, an oil-rich kingdom and key US ally in the Middle East, had lobbied furiously against the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism (Jasta) legislation. It has stopped short of specifying how it might retaliate but has called on Congress to reverse the decision. Relatives of those killed in 9/11 have welcomed the bill's passing. \"We rejoice in this triumph and look forward to our day in court and a time when we may finally get more answers regarding who was truly behind the attacks,\" said Terry Strada, national chair of the 9/11 Families & Survivors United for Justice Against Terrorism.", "An international team of maritime archaeologists are diving, excavating and recording the wreck of Dutch ship the Rooswijk off the Kent coast. All 300 shipmen died when the vessel, carrying coins and silver ingots, sank on Goodwin Sands in January 1740. Never before have any of the Dutch East India Company's 250 wrecks been scientifically excavated on this scale. Historic England manages the protected site and is working with the Dutch government, which owns the ship's remains. It is only now, after more than 250 years, that the sands have shifted enough to unveil the wreckage. Some explorations were carried out last year and those finds are being showcased as part of the #Rooswijk1740 project, led and financed by the Cultural Heritage Agency of the Netherlands, with open days in Ramsgate between 19 August and 16 September. They include a large seaman's chest, pewter jugs, ornately carved wooden knife handles and leather shoes. The current mission will see archaeologists delve further into the storage rooms and living quarters in the stern of the ship. Martijn Manders, project leader of the Rooswijk Excavation and Maritime Heritage programme manager at the Cultural Heritage Agency of the Netherlands, said: \"The Goodwin Sands has been a treacherous place for ships throughout the centuries and is now a treasure trove for archaeologists. \"The rapidly shifting sands mean that the site is even more exposed now than it was during our initial dives to assess the condition of the Rooswijk last year. This makes the excavation urgent.\" The wreck is high on the Heritage at Risk register due to its exposed remains and vulnerability to the shifting sands. Alison James, maritime archaeologist at Historic England, said: \"Wrecks such as the Rooswijk are time capsules that offer a unique glimpse into the past and tell a story. \"We look forward to the fascinating insights and discoveries that the Rooswijk excavation will uncover this summer.\"", "Media playback is not supported on this device Managers returning to a team for a second spell - some enhance their reputations greatly, but for others the phrase \"never go back\" could barely be more pertinent. Ian Holloway will become the latest boss to get reacquainted with familiar surroundings when he takes charge of Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road against Norwich City on Saturday, 10 years after he left the west London club. BBC Sport looks at 10 managers who have enjoyed - or endured - more than one spell with clubs in the English Football League... November 2002 - September 2005, June 2006 - May 2013 As far as quick and lasting returns go, Tony Pulis at Stoke City is top of the list. His first spell with the Potters lasted just under three years and, almost 12 months after he was initially sacked, he was re-appointed as manager and remained at the club for a further seven years. Within two years of his return, he guided Stoke to the top flight after a 23-year absence, took them to the 2011 FA Cup final and led them into Europe, before then suffering some criticism from supporters towards the end of his tenure. March 2003 - March 2004, March 2011 - April 2011, April 2012 - June 2012, March 2014 - present Barnet can not get enough of Martin Allen, or Martin Allen can not get enough of Barnet? Either way, the man nicknamed \"Mad Dog\" has had an on-again-off-again relationship with the Bees for more than 16 years. He started his managerial career with the London side in the Conference in 2003, but did not see out an entire season before leaving for Brentford. Like a boomerang, however, he went back. Three times since, to be exact. The second stint was on an eight-match contract, of which he stayed around for three. Third time around, he helped save them from League Two relegation in another short-term stay, before making his latest comeback, helping them win promotion back to the EFL in 2015. February 1992 - January 1997, January 2008 - September 2008 Kevin Keegan's management career both started and ended at Newcastle United, with stints as England, Fulham and Manchester City boss wedged in between. He was first given the Newcastle job in 1992, going on to save them from relegation, guide them to promotion to the Premier League, very nearly win the title and then take the club into the Champions League. Thousands of fans went to St James' Park to welcome him back as boss in January 2008, but he lasted only eight months and some 200 angry fans soon gathered outside the club's ground after hearing of his departure, with some even seen scaling the walls attempting to get in. March 1982 - June 1985, March 2006 - November 2007 If this was a contest for the most regrettable return to a football club, then Jim Smith is the winner. In his first spell he took Oxford United to the top flight as Division Two champions in 1985. He then left for QPR after winning promotion, but returned two decades later to oversee their relegation from the Football League. Bristol Rovers: July 1987 - May 1991, June 2001 - December 2001; QPR: June 1991- November 1994, October 1998 - February 2001 Former England midfielder Gerry Francis endeared himself to the Bristol Rovers faithful by leading them to the second tier as Division Three champions in 1990, pipping local rivals Bristol City to the title in the process. But, following a hugely popular return to manage the Pirates for a second time in 2001, he struggled to repeat anything like that success and quit before Christmas. Sandwiched in between were two spells in charge at QPR, the club for whom he made his name as a player, first in the Premier League and then in Division One. January 2009 - January 2011, October 2012 - present Eddie Howe, who had two permanent spells as a player at Bournemouth, has overseen the club's remarkable transformation from administration-hit League Two strugglers into Premier League survivors. After a spell as caretaker boss, Howe was appointed permanently in January 2009, going on to steer the Cherries to Football League safety and promotion from League Two. And, after a brief stint with Burnley, he returned in October 2012 to complete the job he started, guiding Bournemouth up to the Championship in April 2013 and then to the top flight for the first time in their history two years later. November 1969 - October 1975, October 1978 - July 1982, May 1985 - May 1987 Serve the club three times as boss, guide them up every step of the Football League to the top flight and even work as general manager for a while. Your reward? Legendary status, a stand named in your honour and a statue in front of the ground. Former Notts County manager Jimmy Sirrel is immortalised in bronze alongside Jack Wheeler at Meadow Lane, with both men having had a profound influence on the club. During his first spell, Sirrel took the Magpies from Division Four to Division Two, and in his second stint - coming after two years at Sheffield United - he went on to take them all the way to the top flight. December 2006 - June 2011, January 2013 - present England were World Cup holders the last time a manager other than Keith Hill led Rochdale to promotion - and he's not just done it once, but twice. The 47-year-old started out as a youth coach at Dale, and then got his chance as boss on a caretaker basis in December 2006, guiding them to League Two safety. Twice Rochdale missed out in the play-offs under Hill, before he finally got them up automatically in 2009-10 - the club's first promotion since 1969, just before he was born. He left for Barnsley in 2011 and Rochdale were relegated two seasons after his departure, but he was re-appointed at Spotland in January 2013 and led them back up again in 2014. June 2001 - September 2005, January 2012 - February 2015 Latvia to Yeovil Town is probably not your average career move, but that is how Gary Johnson's association with the Glovers began in 2001. He won the 2002 FA Trophy and saw Yeovil secure promotion to the Football League for the first time in the club's history, before going on to guide them to League One as League Two champions in 2004-05. Johnson left for Bristol City in 2005, but later returned to Yeovil after a seven-year absence to take them up to the Championship - another first for the club. There was no happy ending for the 61-year-old, however, as they would then go on to suffer back-to-back relegations, with Johnson replaced by Paul Sturrock before their return to League Two was confirmed. 1989 - 1994, April 2004 - February 2013, December 2015 - present Dagenham & Redbridge without John Still just does not seem quite right, does it? The 66-year-old's association with the club goes back to when he managed Redbridge Forest, who merged with Dagenham in 1992 to create the club that exists today. After leaving the Daggers for Peterborough in 1994, he returned 10 years later to spectacular effect, guiding them from non-league all the way up to League One. Unfortunately for Still, he has since taken them all the way back down again - suffering relegation to League Two in 2011 and then, following a stint with Luton, relegation to the National League in May.

Russia shared the list after several requests by diplomats, the EU said. The EU called the ban \"totally arbitrary and unjustified\" and said no explanation had been provided. Many of those on the list are outspoken critics of the Kremlin, and some have been turned away from Russia in recent months. The EU said that it had asked repeatedly for the list of those banned, but nothing had been provided until now. \"The list with 89 names has now been shared by the Russian authorities. We don't have any other information on legal basis, criteria and process of this decision,\" an EU spokesman said on Saturday. \"We consider this measure as totally arbitrary and unjustified, especially in the absence of any further clarification and transparency,\" he added. A Russian foreign ministry official said that the ban was a result of EU sanctions against Russia. \"Why it was precisely these people who entered into the list... is simple - it was done in answer to the sanctions campaign which has been waged in relation to Russia by several states of the European Union,\" the official, who was not named, told Russian news agency Tass. EU sanctions were imposed after Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea region in March 2014, and they have been extended amid ongoing fighting between government troops and pro-Russia separatists in eastern Ukraine. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte told journalists on Friday that the list had been shared with EU diplomats and that three Dutch politicians were on it. He said that the Netherlands would not abide by the ban as it was \"not based on international law\". British intelligence chiefs appear to have been targeted, with a leaked version of the list (in German)naming MI5 director general Andrew Parker and the former MI6 chief Sir John Sawers. Former British foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind told the AFP news agency that he had \"read the reports in the media [of his ban] but not a word from the Russians\". Britain's foreign office said: \"The Russian authorities have not provided any legal basis for the list or for the names on it. \"If Russia thinks this action will cause the EU to change its position on sanctions, it is wrong.\" Also on the list are the French philosopher Bernard-Henri Levy, former Belgian prime minister Guy Verhofstadt and the EU's former enlargement chief Stefan Fule. 'A decent club' Sweden's foreign minister, Margot Wallstrom said that her country has asked for an explanation from Russia. Eight Swedes are on the list, including Swedish MEP Anna Maria Corazza Bildt. \"I'm more proud than scared and this gives me more determination to continue... If the Kremlin takes me and my colleagues seriously it means we're doing a good job,\" she told AFP. The former Czech foreign minister, Karel Schwarzenberg, also said he was pleased to have made the list. \"When I saw the other names (on the list), I found out I was in a very decent club. I consider this a reward,\" he was quoted as saying by the CTK news agency. Other countries with names on the list reportedly include Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Czech Republic, Romania, Bulgaria and Spain.", "In the season-opening Australian Grand Prix, Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel beat Hamilton, who hopes to turn the tables at the Chinese race on Sunday. \"They won it fair and square and that's what makes it exciting,\" Hamilton said. \"The good thing is it is closer and it is going to be margins like that. It's cool to see the racing is that close.\" Hamilton admitted Ferrari \"did a better job\" than Mercedes in Melbourne. \"There are going to be races where that fluctuates,\" he said, \"where perhaps they are ahead and we're behind or the other way around, but we hope to make it that we are ahead more. \"Their car is stronger in certain areas and ours is stronger in certain areas and that is what's going to make the season exciting.\" Vettel, meanwhile, insisted that beating Mercedes \"is not easy at all\". \"We have had one race and managed to beat them but as a global installation or infrastructure they are the team to beat,\" said the German four-time world champion. \"It is clear what we want to do - whether we will be able to time will tell, but i think the team is on the right path. \"Mercedes has to be still the favourite. We had a very strong first race but the way we look at it in the team is we go race by race. \"We know we have a good package, which puts us in a strong place. We know there are a lot of things we need to do to keep up with them and keep the position we are in now to fight for good races.\"", "The bill was passed on Monday by lawmakers in Sindh - home to many of Pakistan's three million Hindus. Activists say that without such a law, Hindu women are targets for forced conversions, abduction and rape, and there is a lack of rights for widows. The national assembly is considering a wider law recognising Hindu marriages. Pakistan's other main religious minority, Christians, have a colonial-era law recognising their marriages. However, Hindus have never had any legal framework to register their unions until now. Many Hindu couples say this has given them logistical problems with basic activities such as opening bank accounts, applying for visas, getting national identity cards and getting shares of property, because they lacked proof of marriage. Under the new law, Hindus above the age of 18 in Sindh can register their marriages. It can be applied retroactively to existing unions. However, the legislation also contains a controversial clause that allows the marriage to be annulled if any spouse converts. Analysis: Shahzeb Jillani, BBC News, Karachi For decades, Pakistan's Hindus have faced discrimination and religious persecution. In rural Sindh, young Hindu girls have been a regular target for abductions, forced religious conversions and underage marriages. The perpetrators of these crimes are often protected by local influential figures linked to Islamic seminaries. The provincial government says the new law will help discourage many of these crimes. Rights activists have described it as a progressive measure and a step in the right direction. \"Passing the law is one thing, the real test will be how the authorities will go about enforcing it,\" said Zohra Yusuf, of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan. But the head of the Pakistan Hindu Council, Dr Ramesh Kumar Vankwani, told the BBC the law did not go far enough to protect Hindu women from forced conversions. He said the provincial legislation was passed in haste at a time when the Pakistani parliament was debating some of the more controversial sections of the proposed national law. Meanwhile, the National Assembly is considering a wider bill on recognising Hindu marriage rights, including issues such as inheritance, divorce, and child maintenance. The bill comes at a time of increased violence against Pakistan's minorities. Some Hindus have fled to India in recent years citing discrimination and religious persecution. Pakistan was created in 1947 after India was partitioned at the end of British rule. Today, Hindus are said to make up more than 2% of Pakistan's population.", "If you have eaten a handful of spicy chicken wings in Angola recently or perhaps polished off a lemony \"yassa poulet\" in Senegal, there is a good chance your chicken travelled some distance before finding its way on to your plate. It depends where you live in Africa, but chickens are increasingly migrating - in freezers - from Brazil, Germany or other European Union countries to the continent. Imports of chicken to sub-Saharan Africa tripled between 2004 and 2014, according to figures from the US Department of Agriculture. Here's a look at reasons behind the huge increase and what can be done to help fatten up the continent's poultry industry - in four points: 1) Why chickens not cows? Africa has a growing population, which is projected to double to 2.5 billion by 2050, and with that has come an increased demand for the consumption of meat, of one variety in particular. \"Chicken is the first choice of meat for most Africans,\" says Kevin Lovell, chief executive of the South Africa Poultry Association. The higher cost of beef and some of the religious restrictions around pork in parts of Africa help explain the preference for chicken, he says. As more people move to the city, their dietary patterns begin to change and they are more likely to choose meat from a local fast food joint, or one of the global chains that have proliferated across the continent in recent years. The fast-food chain Kentucky Fried Chicken now has more than 700 outlets in Africa, operating in 13 countries. \"The production of meat has not caught up with the demand... driven both by the rise in the population but also by the urbanisation phenomenon,\" explains Calestous Juma, a professor of International Development at Harvard University. And the growth really is phenomenal. By 2030, 50% of Africans, numbering more than half a billion, are expected to be living in cities, up from 36% in 2010, according to World Bank estimates. 2) Hungry birds Many Africans will be familiar with the \"road runner\" chicken, which can often be found in the backyard roaming freely. These birds tend to feed themselves and are known for being tough but tasty. As a means to feed the family or make a small income these low-input birds tend to do the job. However, when it comes to intensive farming, a steady supply of chicken feed which is made up of maize and soya is vital. But weak agricultural systems in Africa mean that feed often has to be imported at a high cost, hampering farmers' efforts to ramp up their grain production. Napoleon Oduro, is a Ghanaian poultry and egg farmer with a 500-bird farm, a few hours outside of the capital Accra. He tells me that the imported feed he relies on costs him $25 (\u00c2\u00a320) for a bag of 50kg (110 lb). And with each bird eating about 2.5kg of feed per month, he says costs can quickly become prohibitive. 3) Breeding a \"super chicken\" It is not just the high cost of feed, but the fact that most African chickens need more of it than their fellow birds in developed markets. African farmers do not have the same access to broiler chickens, birds which are specifically bred and raised for meat consumption. \"Many agencies that work in Africa try to come up with what they call locally adapted breeds but it is always a half answer because those birds will never convert animal feed into food as efficiently as the modern improved Western breeds,\" says Mr Lovell. Prof Juma puts this down to a lack of research facilities, which makes it harder to support breeding programmes on the continent. He cites Kenya, where about 80% of the poultry production is based on less productive traditional breeds, as a prime example of the problem. However, there is some good news on this front. The African Chicken Genetic Gains project is on a mission to bring \"more productive chickens to African smallholders\". Led by the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI), and backed by the deep pockets of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, it aims to improve the genetic makeup of African chickens. The initiative, which is initially being rolled out in  Ethiopia, Nigeria and Tanzania is part of what the Microsoft founder has called his \"big bet\" on chickens, which also includes a promise to donate 100,000 of the birds to families and communities in the world's poorest nations. Top tips from African chicken farmers: \"I started off seven years ago with 400 broilers and 300 layers but I realised that maintaining broilers was more expensive.  Raising feed is also tough, my chickens can consume 300kg of food a day! But from my business I sent my three kids to school and bought a car. Tip: \"If you want to start small, start with broilers, they are cheaper and in six weeks you will be selling. And if you are rearing broilers and layers ensure they are kept separately.\" \"Finding a market is a challenge, there are big international companies that flood the market with cheap chickens and stifle local farmers from growing. The cost for feed is high and occasionally thieves break into my pens.\" Tip:\"You can sell your chickens at four weeks, but it is better to wait for six weeks, the meat is better, the chickens heavier.\" \"My local chickens get attacked by eagles and diseases regularly. Getting treatment is not easy. Poor rainfall makes it hard to grow feed. It is available for sale but expensive. But from my business I have sent my two boys to college and two girls to secondary school.\" Tip: \"To protect your chicks from eagles I dye them sky blue to disguise them.\" \"In 2011 I started with 50,000 chickens, my farm has now grown to a company that employs not less than 400 people. We face many challenges - banks are not interested in lending and with the credit crunch, costs for raw materials for our feed have almost doubled.\" Tip: \"Be ready to spend more on chicks from reputable hatchery even if your neighbour's farm is selling cheap chicks.\" 4) Import dilemma One of the major obstacles for farmers in Africa is the flood of imports from Brazil, Europe and the US. Those working in the African poultry sector put this down to a preference for white meat in Western countries. \"In Europe, in particular most people want to eat breast meat and they will pay a lot more for breast meat in a supermarket than they would for dark meat [wings, thighs and legs] and that difference allows the company to make a profit and sell the dark meat for less than it costs to  produce it,\" says Mr Lovell. \"When it gets to South Africa, Ghana, Angola or wherever else in Africa, that causes a problem because the local farmers can't compete.\" In an attempt to bolster local production, various governments across Africa, including those of Botswana, Nigeria, Namibia and Swaziland, have attempted to address the issue by imposing import restrictions. Botswana, with more than three decades of strong import restrictions on poultry behind it, now produces enough chickens to feed its own people. But it also has the most expensive frozen chicken in the region, according to recent research, with critics calling for the government to open up market up to competition to bring prices down. Mr Oduro has the same problem over prices: \"Customers will say that what we produce here in Ghana is expensive as compared to the imported chicken.\" But the Ghanaian farmer criticises the government for a lack of intervention, saying that it has failed to invest and support his sector for many years. \"We are not against imports, we are crying for a policy that will make the Ghanaian farmer competitive.\" Top farming tips produced by Joab Frank Chakhaza", "Clucas, 25, joined Hull from League One side Chesterfield in July 2015 for a reported \u00a31.3m.

Former members said the unit had shot people who may have been unarmed. The PSNI investigation has found none of the men featured \"admitted any criminal act or being involved in any of the incidents portrayed\". In a statement,  the PSNI said: \"Detectives from Serious Crime Branch have studied the contents of a BBC Panorama programme broadcast last year into the activities of the MRF. \"Although there does not appear to be any admission to criminality by individuals featured in the programme, it will form part of an HET review into all deaths linked to soldiers. \"This review will begin when HET resumes its work in the near future.\" The unit was disbanded in 1973, after 18 months. The plain-clothes soldiers carried out round-the-clock patrols in Belfast in unmarked cars. Three former members of the unit talked to Panorama. They said they had been tasked with \"hunting down\" IRA members in Belfast. When asked if on occasion the MRF would make an assumption that someone had a weapon, even if they could not see one, one of the former soldiers replied \"occasionally\". \"We didn't go around town blasting, shooting all over the place like you see on the TV, we were going down there and finding, looking for our targets, finding them and taking them down,\" he said. \"We may not have seen a weapon, but there more than likely would have been weapons there in a vigilante patrol.\" One of the soldiers said they were \"not there to act like an army unit, we were there to act like a terror group\". Solicitor Padraig \u00c3\u201c Muirigh represents families who believe their relatives were killed by the MRF. He said police should further investigate the soldiers' claims. \"They very openly and brazenly admitted that they were in a terror gang, that they acted outside the rule of law, that they also acted outside of the yellow card rule,\" he said. \"They also admitted being involved in fatal incidents in which people may not have been armed. \"I think all of that and that very high-profile Panorama programme pointed in the direction that there should have been further investigation of these matters. \"Unfortunately it appears that the PSNI have not done that, despite the request from the director of public prosecutions.\"", "The as-yet-untitled book will appear in 2013, the 60th anniversary of the super-spy's first literary outing, in Ian Fleming's Casino Royale. Boyd has revealed that his story will mark a return to \"classic Bond\" and will be set in the late 1960s. He is the third author in recent years to be invited by the Ian Fleming estate to write an official Bond novel. Before him came American thriller writer Jeffery Deaver, who penned Carte Blanche in 2011; and Sebastian Faulks, whose Devil May Care was published to mark Ian Fleming's centenary in 2008. Deaver's book, released in May last year, is set in the present day and portrayed Bond as a Royal Naval Reserve veteran whose service included a tour of Afghanistan. It has sold over 160,000 copies to date and is out in paperback next month. Sales of Carte Blanche  in its opening week were about a third of those achieved by Faulks' book in the same period. Other writers to take on Fleming's hero include John Gardner and Charlie Higson, author of the Young Bond  books. Boyd said he had \"accepted at once\" when invited by the Ian Fleming estate to write the new Bond novel. \"For me the prospect appeared incredibly exciting and stimulating - a once-in-a-lifetime challenge,\" he said. \"In fact my father introduced me to the James Bond novels in the 1960s and I read them all then - From Russia with Love being my favourite.\" Boyd's novels include A Good Man in Africa (1981), which won the Whitbread First Novel Award; An Ice-Cream War (1982), shortlisted for Booker Prize; Brazzaville Beach (1990); Any Human Heart and Restless (2006). Boyd's \"fascination\" with Ian Fleming was previously seen in Any Human Heart (2002). He wrote Fleming into the narrative, making him responsible for recruiting the protagonist, Logan Mountstuart, to the Naval Intelligence Division in World War II. Boyd also points out that three of his screenplays have starred big-screen Bond actors: Sean Connery in A Good Man in Africa, Pierce Brosnan in Mr Johnson and Daniel Craig in The Trench. \"The idea that these somewhat random connections with Fleming and Bond should culminate in my writing a new James Bond novel is irresistibly appealing,\" Boyd said. \"The only thing I'm prepared to say at this stage about the novel that I will write is that it will be set in 1969.\" His most recent novel, Waiting for Sunrise, was published in the UK in February and comes out in the US later this month. \"William Boyd is a contemporary English writer whose classic novels combine literary elements with a broad appeal,\" said Corinne Turner, managing Director of Ian Fleming Publications Ltd. \"His thrillers occupy the niche that Ian Fleming would fill were he writing today and with similar style and flair. This, alongside his fascination with Fleming himself, makes him the perfect choice to take Bond back to his 1960s world.\" The new Bond novel will be published in the UK and Commonwealth in autumn 2013 by Jonathan Cape - Ian Fleming's original publisher - and simultaneously by HarperCollins Publishers in USA and  Canada. Cape was also the publisher of the first ever official Bond novel following Fleming's death in 1964, when Kingsley Amis wrote Colonel Sun as Robert Markham in 1968. Fleming's first Bond novel, Casino Royale, was published in 1953. Since then, the Bond books have sold more than 100 million copies worldwide. The 14 books, including two short story collections, will be relaunched this summer. Sales are likely to be boosted by the release, in October, of Daniel Craig's third 007 film Skyfall, which comes 50 years after the original Bond film, Dr No.", "The animals were happily munching in the front garden of a house in Drummond Road close to its junction with the busier Culduthel Road.

The works were all commissioned as part of the BP Portrait Award first prize. 'Paul Smith to J.K. Rowling' opens at the University of Hull on Wednesday. More on this story and others from East Yorkshire and northern Lincolnshire First prize winners of the BP Portrait Award are invited to create a portrait of a public figure who has made an important contribution to British history and culture. The National Portrait Gallery said it was a \"rare opportunity\" to see all the commissions in one place. Professor Glenn Burgess, acting vice-chancellor of the University of Hull, said: \"Not only does the exhibition depict a wonderful range of famous faces, from actors to athletes and beyond, but the artists responsible have used an amazing variety of styles and compositions in creating these beautiful works.\" The free exhibition runs at the Brynmor Jones Library until June.", "The investigation by the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) follows a 2013 investigation by BBC Panorama into the Military Research Force, or MRF. Daniel Rooney was 18 when he and a friend were shot by MRF soldiers firing from an unmarked car, as the youths stood on a street corner in the St James area of west Belfast. The army claimed the men were armed. Eyewitnesses dispute this, consistent with forensic tests on Rooney and his friend that suggested neither youth was armed. Mr Rooney was buried without a post-mortem examination. However, while a medical report recorded a bullet entry wound, there was no mention of an exit wound. The PSNI want to see if the bullet can be retrieved from Mr Rooney's remains, assuming it was lodged in his body. It may then be possible to determine whether the bullet came from a military weapon. The year of 1972 was the most violent of the 30-year Northern Ireland conflict. A total of 497 people died, mostly civilians killed in bombings or shot by the Provisional IRA and 151 soldiers and police officers were also killed. Panorama showed that, between May and September 1972, there were several unprovoked \"drive-by\" attacks on unarmed civilians by MRF soldiers similar to the one that killed Mr Rooney. At the time, locals assumed the gunmen were loyalists. One attack is alleged to have been preceded by a friendly wave from the driver before a machine gun protruding from a rear window cut down three unarmed men chatting at a taxi rank. On this occasion the MRF soldiers were armed with a weapon, commonly used by the IRA, known as the \"Chicago grinder\". This was a Thompson sub-machine gun also favoured by the 1920s gangster Al Capone. Panorama showed how in each disputed shooting, the MRF soldiers claimed they were fired on. Yet there was no independent evidence to show that any of the dead or wounded were armed, or that they provoked the attacks, or even that they were members of the IRA. Two months after Daniel Rooney was shot, the military top brass decided the MRF was imperilling the army's already damaged reputation. Declassified papers show that a review of the MRF found there was \"no provision for detailed command and control\". The MRF was wound up after only 14 months. When Prime Minister Edward Heath was told the MRF was to be replaced with the Special Reconnaissance Unit (SRU), he sent a message to the army emphasising that \"special care should be taken\" to ensure that the SRU should \"operate within the law\". Det Ch Insp Neil McGuinness of the PSNI's Legacy Investigation Branch said: \"Every effort has been made to complete\" Rooney's exhumation \"as sensitively and professionally as possible\". Last year the remains of a father of 12, Joseph Murphy, who was shot by the army in disputed circumstances, were exhumed. Having been shot once, Mr Murphy was brought to an army base where he claimed a soldier shot him again in the place that he had been previously wounded. He later died in hospital. A bullet was recovered from his grave when his remains were exhumed.", "At least 60 people were injured when Iraqi troops drove back thousands of mainly Shia Muslims protesting against corruption and security failures. Soldiers fired real and rubber bullets at the protesters, as well as tear gas. Some reports, citing hospital sources, said four people had been killed and 90 injured in the clashes. On Saturday two coffins draped in flags were driven through part of the city, flanked by mourners. Iraqi President Fuad Masum called on protesters to \"abide by the law and apply self-restraint\". In a statement published on the presidency website, Mr Masum said violent rallies would distract security forces from preventing terror attacks. It was the second time this month that protesters managed to break into the city's government area. Shia Muslim cleric Moqtada Sadr condemned the use of force by the police, and voiced support for the demonstrators' \"peaceful [and] spontaneous revolt\". The protesters accuse the government of neglecting much needed reforms, as it struggles with its campaign against the so-called Islamic State group (IS) and declining oil revenues. The Sunni jihadist group controls parts of western and northern Iraq and has been behind a wave of recent attacks that have left dozens killed. Some demonstrators managed to break into the prime minister's office and parliament. Baghdad's Green Zone houses the parliament, key government buildings and many foreign embassies. The authorities later said they had completely regained control of the area and the protesters had withdrawn. The Shia cleric and his militia group, the Mehdi Army, gained prominence after the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. galvanising anti-US sentiment. Mr Sadr's followers clashed repeatedly with US forces, whose withdrawal the cleric consistently demanded. An arrest warrant was issued for Mr Sadr in 2004 in connection with the murder of a rival cleric. His militia was also blamed for the torture and killing of thousands of Sunnis in the sectarian carnage of 2006 and 2007. Mr Sadr fled to Iran during that period. In 2011, Mr Sadr returned from his self-imposed exile to Iraq, taking a more conciliatory tone and calling for Iraqi unity and peace. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, who came to power in 2014, has promised to stamp out corruption and ease sectarian tensions. He has been pressing for radical reforms and wants to form a government of technocrats, but has been blocked by lawmakers, the BBC's Jim Muir in Baghdad reports.

Clare Fallon reports for BBC North West Tonight.", "Pte Cheryl James, 18, from Llangollen, Denbighshire, was found with a bullet wound to her head in Surrey in 1995. Her parents said a dispute over the ballistics evidence could only be resolved if her body is exhumed. Coroner Brian Barker QC said he would wait for a doctor's report before he made the decision. He told the pre-inquest review at Woking Coroner's Court that exhumation was a \"difficult and unusual\" step. Alison Foster QC, representing Pte James' family, said her relatives were \"really dismayed to be at this point today\". \"From our standpoint, an exhumation would be necessary for you to carry out a full and proper inquiry.\" Bullet fragments in Pte James' body were yellow, while the SA80 rifle she was armed with used red bullets, Ms Foster said. \"There is no actual evidence that it was an SA80 that caused the bullet wound to Cheryl,\" she added. The coroner said the full inquest on 1 February would consider whether there were \"shortcomings\" with the barracks's policies on sexual behaviour, supervision of young females, drugs, alcohol and accommodation. Another pre-inquest hearing is to held on 10 September. Pte James was one of four soldiers found dead at Deepcut, in Camberley, between 1995 and 2002. Surrey Police's request that her inquest should be heard alongside fresh inquests into the deaths of Privates Sean Benton, Geoff Gray and James Collinson was turned down. A spokeswoman for the force said: \"[Surrey Police] has now completed the review of disclosure documents relating to Pte James.\" She said arrangements for the inquest were a matter for the coroner. \"Surrey Police is supportive of the view that there should be a thorough inquest into circumstances surrounding the death of Pte James and our thoughts remain with her family.\"", "Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson endorsed her party's UK manifesto. Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said the Conservatives were \"talking up\" the SNP's prospects. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon was in New Lanark, while Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy was on the campaign trail in Cumbernauld. Speaking at the Dawnfresh fish factory in Uddingston, Ms Davdison believed that a Labour government propped up by the SNP would be damaging for the UK's finances. She said that under a Conservative government minimum wage earners would pay no income tax. Ms Davidson added: \"We're the party which will sort out the economy so that we can afford a great NHS and give you and your family the chance to make the most of your lives. \"The SNP and Labour have the brass neck to pretend that they have a plan for the economy but any plan based on more taxes, more borrowing and more debt would wreck all the hard work of the last five years.\" However, Mr Rennie, who was campaigning in Pittenweem, said the Conservatives, were \"putting their party before their country by seeking to increase their vote share at any price\". He added: \"The Conservative election campaign has repeatedly talked up the SNP. Immediately after the UK leaders debates, George Osborne was talking up the performance of Nicola Sturgeon. \"I am not sure what kind of bizarre tactical game he was playing but it can only have helped the SNP increase their support further. \"And now the Conservatives in Scotland are getting in the way of our battles to stop the SNP in the 11 Westminster seats we hold in Scotland.\" What are the top issues for each political party at the 2015 general election? Policy guide: Where the parties stand Ms Sturgeon attacked both the Tories and Labour as she continued election campaigning. She said: \"People in Scotland have always known to expect harsh, ideological cuts from the Tories - and today's cuts manifesto is likely to be more of the same. But that Labour have been so quick to meekly fall into line with George Osborne's plans just goes to show how far they have moved away from their roots. \"And with Ed Balls lifting the lid on Labour's cuts plans yesterday and finally putting an end to Jim Murphy's anti-cuts pretence, Labour's commitment to austerity is clear for all to see.\" The SNP leader and first minister of Scotland had earlier taken questions from listeners on BBC Radio's Five Live morning phone in. In response to a question from presenter Nicky Campbell, Ms Sturgeon reiterated that she was not planning another independence referendum. She said that if you voted SNP on 7 May, you were not voting for another referendum. In Cumbernauld, Mr Murphy said SNP plans for Scottish taxes supporting Scotland's finances would mean millions lost for working families in tax credits. Mr Murphy said: \"The SNP's reckless plans will cost working families the most, with a \u00a37.6bn black hole in Scotland's finances and the end of the UK welfare state as we know it. \"Scotland doesn't have to choose between Tory austerity or SNP austerity max. Scottish Labour is the only party on the ballot paper offering a real alternative to austerity. \"Only Labour is big enough and strong enough to kick the Tories out and give working families the support they need.\" Meanwhile, the Scottish Greens backed the manifesto commitments of the Green Party of England and Wales which they believe would make a positive difference to people's lives. Alison Johnstone, from the Scottish Greens said: \"Greens across these islands are clear: we must end Westminster's failed austerity experiment.\" Voters throughout the UK go to the polls on 7 May to choose their next MP. Polling suggests the contest will be tight and no one party will win an overall majority in the House of Commons.", "The RMT union began the 72-hour walkout on New Year's Eve. The action prompted warnings of widespread disruption for travellers during new year celebrations. Southern's parent firm Govia Thameslink (GTR) is in dispute with both the RMT and Aslef unions. Another strike is set for 9 January. The planned six-day strike involves train drivers from both unions. Most routes are expected to have no services. The train drivers' union Aslef is continuing with a ban on overtime which is adding to the disruption. The RMT and GTR have said they are available for talks and Aslef took part in negotiations in December at conciliation service Acas, but discussions ended without a deal. RMT leader Mick Cash called on Transport Secretary Chris Grayling to make it his new year resolution \"to get in a room with the unions and his contractors to sort out the current shambles\". Mr Grayling said it was frustrating the unions had decided to start a new year with the continuation of an old strike. He said: \"We are investing record amounts in improving our railways and we need everyone in the rail industry to work together to deliver for passengers. \"Now the unions need to come back to the negotiating table. Only they can end this misery for rail users.\" Southern's deputy chief operating officer Alex Foulds said: \"Our door remains open for meaningful talks.\" The politics behind the Southern rail dispute What's the Southern Rail strike about? How bad have Southern rail services got? The Association of British Commuters said disruption had caused health problems, forced people to move house and lose jobs. The campaign group surveyed about 1,000 passengers and said the results highlighted the extent of suffering as a result of the \"breakdown\" of Southern services, with delays, cancellations and overcrowding. Calling for government intervention, a spokesman said: \"Thousands of people are now at breaking point.\" The Department for Transport has said the dispute is between Southern and the unions and \"not something the government is involved in\".", "It was first spotted at Montevrain, 38km (23 miles) east of Paris. Sightings of the animal sparked a search involving hundreds of emergency services workers, animal-trackers and a helicopter. But experts now say the animal is most likely a much less dangerous animal, such as a lynx or large domestic cat. They made their conclusions based on inspecting animal tracks. It remains unclear where the animal came from, though there is a big cat park near Montevrain. A source told AFP that the search had been scaled back for the moment and the helicopter grounded, although forces remained \"mobilised\" in case of a fresh alert. The BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris says police had suggested there was probably not too much to worry about, but the authorities still sent out officers with guns and tranquilisers. The hunt has focused on areas near the Disneyland Paris theme park. There was a fresh alert on Friday morning after paw prints were discovered near a service station east of Paris. To reach there, the animal had apparently crossed the A4 motorway. Police guarded the entrances to schools in the Montevrain area in case the cat turned up, as a helicopter with thermal imaging hovered. Local residents were asked to stay indoors and parents urged to take their children to and from school by car. A dozen or so soldiers from a nearby army base joined police and fire officials combing the countryside outside Montevrain. A huntsman, officially designated as a \"wolf catcher\", who has a specially trained dog, was also part of the search team. The owner of the lntermarche supermarket in Montevrain said on Thursday that his wife had spotted the animal at about 08:30 (07:30 GMT). \"She didn't get out of the car and called me to say 'I think I saw a lynx',\" he was quoted as saying. The woman took a photograph that appears to show a large cat. Le Parisien newspaper said several local residents had sighted the animal. The Montevrain mayor's office dismissed the idea that the big cat could have escaped from a circus that was in the town until Saturday, Le Parisien reported.", "Cheesman, a three times Oxford Blue, joined the Championship side in 2012 and has made over 100 appearances.

He said the EU was the only major power to attach \"political\" conditions to its relationship with Israel. This, he said, was damaging to the bloc's security and economic interests. The EU has repeatedly condemned Israel's building of Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank. In comments picked up on the headphones of reporters waiting outside the meeting, Mr Netanyahu told the prime ministers of Hungary, the Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia: \"The European Union is the only association of countries in the world that conditions the relations with Israel... on political conditions. The only ones.\" He was referring to the EU's insistence on terms relating to the Israeli-Palestinian peace process being included in its Association Agreement with Israel, signed in 2000 and not subsequently updated. \"It's crazy. It's actually crazy,\" he said. \"It's not about my interest. I'm talking about Europe's interest. \"We have a special relationship with China. And they don't care. They don't care about the political issues.\" He added that India and Russia had a similar approach, and urged the four prime ministers to push for a deal on a new Association Agreement. \"There is no logic here. The EU is undermining its security by undermining Israel. Europe is undermining its progress by undermining its connection with Israeli innovation by a crazy attempt to create conditions.\" He added: \"I think Europe has to decide if it wants to live and thrive or if it wants to shrivel and disappear. \"I am not very politically correct. I know that's a shock to some of you. It's a joke. But the truth is the truth. Both about Europe's security and Europe's economic future. Both of these concerns mandate a different policy toward Israel.\" Mr Netanyahu also criticised the policies of former US President Barack Obama's administration, saying things had improved since Donald Trump took office. \"We had a big problem. I think its different now. Vis-a-vis Iran, there is a stronger position. The US is more engaged in the region and conducting more bombings.\" He also admitted that Israel had carried out dozens of attacks against Iranian-backed militia group Hezbollah's arms convoys in Syria. \"I told [Russian President Vladimir] Putin, when we see them transferring weapons to Hezbollah, we will hurt them. We did it dozens of times,\" he said. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has been an outspoken opponent of  Muslim immigration to Europe, later told reporters: \"We share Israel's notion of protecting external borders. If Europe does not co-operate with Israel, it is punishing itself.\"", "It may seem strange to measure the impact of a presidential visit to the EU institutions and Nato simply in terms of faux-pas avoided and false steps not taken but somehow that's the way it is for Mr Trump. The 45th President of the United States found himself immersed for the first time and at first hand in the complexities of the EU. And he discovered that they have sprinkled the title of president rather liberally among the heads of the European Commission, European Council and European Parliament. Even with all those presidential figures on hand in Brussels, it was hard to ignore the feeling that, as European leaders were getting to know the president they must now deal with, they were being offered a tantalising glimpse of the president they preferred. Whether by coincidence or not, Barack Obama was appearing at around the same time 700km (435 miles) down the road at a huge public event in Berlin. Mr Obama had an easier day of it than Mr Trump. He basked in the admiration of a huge crowd at the Brandenburg Gate alongside Chancellor Angela Merkel where they had gathered for a celebration of the strength of the Evangelical Church. Mrs Merkel, said Mr Obama, had done great things for Germany and the world - and it may well be the case that his endorsement will still carry a little weight as the chancellor faces elections later in the year. At around the same time Mr Trump was holding talks with those various European presidents - including Jean-Claude Juncker of the European Commission, who once talked of the need to educate Mr Trump about \"the world he does not know\". No-one took questions after the meeting. Mr Trump said nothing at all and Donald Tusk from the EU Council confined himself to an on-camera statement in which he alluded to one or two areas where it would be hard to disagree - like the importance of fighting terrorism and shared values like freedom and human dignity - but then said enough to suggest that there were plenty of areas where they had not found it hard to disagree. \"Some issues,\" he said, \"remain open like climate and trade. And I'm not 100% sure we can say today that we have a common position, a common opinion about Russia.\" Mr Trump's schedule appeared to have been designed to minimise opportunities for press scrutiny, so there was no chance to ask him directly whether he had changed his views on Brexit, which is viewed as a catastrophe in Brussels but which he has described as both \"great\" and \"fantastic\". A news conference would also have presented the president with an opportunity to examine his evolving attitude towards Nato which he has variously described both as \"obsolete\" and \"no longer obsolete\". In the absence of such scrutiny, some reporters devoted themselves to microscopic observation of the Trump body language. Anyone who followed the discussions during the Middle Eastern section of the tour about whether the first couple were holding hands as they walked in public might care to note that, as they waited at the US embassy residence to greet their lunch guest Emmanuel Macron, they did not stand hand-in-hand but were so close together that their arms were touching. The rather awkward presidential handshake with Mr Macron is a good example of how that kind of scrutiny works. It lasted only a little more than five seconds. While it did look rather over-extended, some reporters spoke of \"knuckles whitening\" and of \"faces tightened\" and one even described it as \"screw-you in handshake form\". Watch the video above and judge for yourselves. When President Trump did finally speak in public towards the end of his day in Brussels, it was worth waiting for. He made a short speech at the magnificent new Nato headquarters building and pointed out rather archly that he had avoided asking how much the palatial new building had cost, even though the alliance's over-reliance on American guns and money is one of his favourite diplomatic themes. But he did not confine himself to that little joke on the subject. In a blunt address, he said directly that 23 of the 28 Nato members were not paying their fair share towards its costs and warned that was unfair to the American taxpayer - a remark that will surely resonate back home. He also conflated very directly the problem of terrorism with the issue of immigration in a way that very few of his fellow Nato leaders would endorse, but which picked up on one of his favourite campaign themes from last year. Here again, though, it seems that Mr Trump's visit may be remembered not for the big politics or the strategic thought but for another curious moment captured on camera and instantly transmitted by social media. As the leaders began to group themselves for the formal summit photograph, Mr Trump appeared to emerge from the back of the pack and firmly push out of the way Dusko Markovic, the prime minister of Montenegro - which is about to join the alliance. The American leader is then seen to draw himself to his full height, ready for the picture. So, certainly no diplomatic disasters on President Trump's first visit to Brussels. He came to give his fellow Nato leaders something to think about and so he did. But something about the president somehow means that he can't help giving everyone something to talk about at the same time.", "\"Golden Rice\" has been developed by scientists to combat vitamin A deficiency, which affects millions of children in the developing world. The crop was just weeks away from being submitted to the authorities for a safety evaluation. But a group of around 400 protestors attacked the field trial in the Bicol region and uprooted all the GM plants. The project to develop Golden Rice was started 20 years ago in 1993 by German researchers with funding from the Rockefeller Foundation. The rice has been modified by adding extra genes that turn on the plant's ability to produce beta-carotene, which humans can convert into vitamin A. A lack of this vitamin increases the chances of blindness and susceptibility to disease. Vitamin A deficiency is a significant problem among children in developing countries. According to Helen Keller International, around 670,000 children will die each year from the problem, while 350,000 will go blind. It is estimated that one cup of Golden Rice could provide half an adult's recommended daily intake. Golden Rice field trials are currently being carried out in the Philippines under the auspices of the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), together with PhilRice, the local research body. Five small test plots have been planted with the idea that there would shortly be a submission to the regulatory authority of the Philippines. It was hoped that initial releases to farmers could happen in 2014. The plot in Bicol was guarded and fenced but the protestors broke through the security and uprooted and trampled the rice plants. The attackers who were members of a group called Sikwal-Gmo say they attacked the crop because they believe that GM technology is not the solution to malnutrition in the Philippines. The protestors argue that international agrochemical corporations and the US are behind the drive for Golden Rice. In a statement, they said they were concerned that the rice trial was both a danger to human health and biodiversity. The scientists involved with the trial say they were relieved that no-one was hurt during the incident. \"It was not completely unexpected as we had heard threats,\" the IRRI's Dr Bruce Tolentino told BBC News. \"It was certainly disappointing to have our field trial vandalised because our Golden Rice research aims to avoid the horrible plight of women and children suffering vitamin A deficiency.\" The researchers say that the development of the modified rice remains critical for the Philippines as 1.7 million children in the country aged under five are affected by vitamin A deficiency. They say they are determined to go ahead with the project. \"This is not a major setback, because it is just one trial of a series and just one of several sites. We remain completely committed to continuing our Golden Rice research to help improve people's nutrition,\" said Dr Tolentino. The development of GM technology is highly contentious in the Philippines. Earlier this year, the Court of Appeals rejected another crop, an eggplant that had been modified to produce toxins to a pest. The court ruled that the crop violated the constitutional rights of Filipinos to health and a balanced ecology.

Officers have found emails from Mr Bach to another senior IOC official Patrick Hickey, who was arrested last month and is facing charges. Mr Hickey, ex-head of the Irish Olympic Committee, denies all allegations. Police investigators in Rio told the BBC's Wyre Davies they would like to know what Mr Bach's influence was over Olympic ticketing policy. They said the IOC president received personal requests for hundreds of high-value tickets, for the Olympics opening ceremony, the 100m final and the football final from Mr Hickey. Police say that Mr Hickey received 296 tickets after his written request to the IOC president. They have not, thus far, made any contact with the president's office to request a formal interview. Mr Hickey was arrested during the Olympic games and spent time at the notorious Bangu high security jail along with fellow Irishman Kevin Mallon. He was released on bail at the end of August but had to return his passport to the Brazilian authorities and was ordered not to leave the country. A prosecutor laid charges against him on Tuesday. A judge will now decide whether to accept or reject the charges. Mr Hickey, 71, has formally stood aside as president of the Olympic Council of Ireland and European Olympic Committees' president during the investigation. Mr Mallon is the Dublin-based director of THG Sports, a corporate and sports hospitality company. Mr Bach cancelled a planned appearance in Rio this week at the opening of the Paralympic Games, for personal reasons. Mr Bach has not returned to Rio since the Olympics and missed the opening ceremony of the Paralympics at the Maracana on Wednesday. He said would remain in Germany for the funeral of his friend Walter Scheel, the former West German foreign minister and deputy chancellor, who died last month aged 97. IOC officials said Mr Bach would now not travel to Brazil after the funeral because he was unable to reschedule other commitments. The Paralympics run until 18 September. The last time an IOC president failed to attend a Paralympics was in 2010, when Jacques Rogge missed the whole of the Winter Games in Vancouver.", "I remember to this day the feeling of freezing rain blinding me and the extreme cold wind causing my ears to hurt. However, that did not bother me at this time. What was the occasion? Well, this was Hogmanay and the boys of the township were carrying out the traditional ritual of going from house to house on this special evening. What is the tradition behind it? It is widely thought that some of these island traditions came from the Vikings who were settlers in the Western Isles in particular, during past times. To be honest, that did not matter to me. I was out and about having fun. This traditional event, which happened in the Uists throughout the centuries, was also practised in many other places, but with differences in format depending on where you lived. On these nights it was the young males that went round the township with permission given to boys as young as five to go out with the big boys. The upper age limit was normally 17. My township was North Boisdale and I would say there were about 25 houses to visit and a few not so friendly dogs to dodge. The start time was 19:00 and all the boys would meet up at one end of the township and begin to visit each house. Each person had a pillow case or bag that would be filled with goodies received from householders. As you walked between each house the boys would shout in Gaelic \"Hogmanay and New Year Hooray\". This alerted the folk, especially on a clear calm night, that the Hogmanay boys were on their way. Outside each house one person would recite the Hogmanay poem and at the end of the poem ask the man of the house for permission to enter. Once inside the house a candle would be lit by the eldest boy in the group and then the candle would be passed round all family members starting with the householder. There was superstition involved with this as it was thought that when the candle was being circled above each individual's head, if the candle was to go out it meant that individual would have a year of bad luck. Of course jokers within the family would try and blow the candle out when this was taking place. Once every member of the family had been passed the candle, the mother of the house would bring out the gifts. Loafs of bread, sugar, fruit, biscuits and of course sweets. Sometimes folk would offer meat or fish. The man of the house would give money, as would older males in the family. Older men in the township would offer a dram to the senior boys, which would of course be refused. On leaving each house the oldest boy in the group would wish luck on the family for the coming year. After being to each house the pillowcases would be full and heavy and it was at the last house that the fun began. The pillowcases would be emptied and the goods shared out evenly. It did not matter how old you were - the boys all got their share. The hosting house would also provide a small party that would finish before midnight so all the boys were home before the bells. On the way home the blinding rain or freezing conditions did not bother me as I now had a pillowcase full of goodies, a full belly, and money in my pocket. A great start to the New Year. Dr Ragnhild Ljosland, a lecturer at Centre for Nordic Studies in Orkney, confirms the Hogmanay Boys tradition has connections to Norse culture. She says: \"As a child in Norway in the 1980s, I remember dressing up to g\u00c3\u00a5 julebukk (go Yule-goating). \"Julebukk involves putting on a mask and going to people's doors to chase Christmas out around New Year. You sing and carry a sack to collect cakes and sweeties - ah, the joy of ending up with a huge sack of goodies. \"If we go a couple of hundred years further back in time, Norwegian people used to walk in a group around the farms in the parish, dressed up so that nobody would recognise them. \"These costumes could be rather frightening and represent fantastical animals, such as an effigy of a billygoat's head on a stick. The guisers would be offered food and drink at each farm. \"These customs are extremely old, going back to pre-Christian beliefs. \"Folk belief had it that supernatural beings were extra active at this time of year. \"Interestingly, similar traditions are also found in Iceland, the Faroes, Shetland and Orkney. In Shetland today, for example, guisers travel around and are offered food and drink at Up Helly Aa in January.\"", "The police allege 28-year-old Nazrul, also called Nazu, was the man who raped the 74-year-old nun. The man, allegedly a Bangladeshi citizen, was arrested at a railway station in Kolkata (Calcutta). The incident caused outrage in India and led to street protests in many cities across the country. This marks the sixth arrest in the crime. Police have identified eight suspects in the attack, of which two still remain untraced. \"All the five accused arrested earlier have named Nazrul as the person who raped the nun,\" a police officer told the BBC. Dilip Kumar Adak, deputy inspector general of the state's Criminal Investigation Department, told the AFP news agency that police acted on a tip off that Nazu, who had fled to Bangladesh after being identified from CCTV footage of the attack, was due to return to Kolkata by train. In May, the police said they had arrested Milon Sarkar and described him as the leader of the gang which attacked the convent. They said it was not clear what role the man had played in the case. During the attack in Ranaghat town on 14 March, money was stolen from the convent school and the building ransacked, before the nun was raped in the convent itself.", "Fast forward about 20 years, and it's fair to say he has done just that. The business he runs, Frasers Hospitality, is one of the world's biggest providers of high-end serviced apartments. Its 148 properties span about 80 capital cities, as well as financial hubs across Europe, Asia, the Middle East and Africa. But it almost didn't get off the ground. When Mr Choe was appointed to launch and lead the company, Asia was booming; the tiger economies of Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore were expanding rapidly. But as Frasers prepared to open its first two properties in Singapore, the Asian financial crisis hit. It was 1997. Currencies went into freefall. Suddenly, people were losing their jobs and stopped travelling. Mr Choe recalls asking staff if they really wanted to continue working with the firm, because when the properties opened they might not get paid. \"It was really that serious,\" he says. \"I remember tearing up because they said 'let's open it, let's open it whether you can pay us or not'.\" Survival, Mr Choe admits, came through a bit of luck, and the misfortune of others. He had convinced the board at parent firm, property group Frasers Centrepoint, to open serviced apartments rather than hotels - partly because getting planning permission in Singapore was easier. But he also sensed it was a big, untapped market. And at the time of the crisis, it proved to be exactly what customers wanted. \"As we were going through this difficult patch, there were protests and riots in Jakarta,\" he says. \"A lot of companies like Microsoft called up looking for rooms for their staff because they were moving out of Jakarta.\" Frasers' 412 apartments were quickly in demand. Occupancy soon hit 70%, and then 90%. Explaining the popularity of serviced apartments, Mr Choe says that if people are staying somewhere for just a few days, they happily stay in hotels, but if they are going to be somewhere for one month to eight months, the walls of hotel rooms \"close in on you\". But now, Mr Choe, 57, faces new challenges - the travel tastes of millennials and the disruptive nature of Airbnb. \"The way to tackle Airbnb is not to ignore it. I will never underestimate Airbnb,\" he says. There's been no significant impact on Frasers yet. Big corporations still prefer to put employees in big service apartments, he says, because they can guarantee a level of safety and security. But that is likely to change, Mr Choe admits. \"I have two daughters who to my chagrin use Airbnb,\" he says. \"We took a family trip to Florence and I stayed in this wonderful boutique hotel, but paid a bundle for it. \"When my daughter joined us, she said, 'I'm just staying next door and paying about 80 euros'. We paid about 330 euros. \"I asked why they stayed at Airbnb. They say 'it's like a surprise, it's part of the adventure'.\" And so now, Mr Choe wants to bring some of that vibrancy to Frasers. While neutral colours, beige curtains and dark wooden chairs dominate its more traditional apartments, many customers want something different, and this is shaping Fraser's strategy. In 2015 it bought Malmaison Hotel du Vin, a UK hotel group that specialises in developing heritage properties into upscale boutique hotels. That has taken them beyond financial centres, including to Shakespeare's hometown of Stratford-upon-Avon. Or, an intrepid traveller with $500 (\u00c2\u00a3325) to spend could have a night in a converted medieval prison in Oxford. And Frasers has launched the Capri sub-brand - whose website promises \"inspiring art and inspirational tech\". On a day-to-day basis Mr Choe says he still draws on his experience as a young man, who - having been given a scholarship by the Shangri-La hotel group to study at Cornell University in the US - came back to Asia to learn about the hospitality industry. \"They put me in every department conceivable. I remember one of the toughest jobs I had was in the butchery. I had to carve an entire cow. For one month, I could not eat meat. \"I'm thankful for those experiences. When you step into a hotel, you immediately pick up what works and what doesn't work. \"When I see the check-in staff walking more than three steps, I know the counter is set up wrong. \"It's like a cockpit. Can you imagine if the pilot had to turn around when he flies?\" More The Boss features, which every week profile a different business leader from around the world: The 'diva of divorce' for the world's super rich The snacks boss with an appetite for success Taking his own path: The world's leading maze designer Mr Choe adds that loyalty is very important to him, and he remains tremendously grateful to staff who have stayed with him. \"I will always respect and remember those who gave up their jobs to join me,\" he says. This loyalty is something that Mr Choe has earned, according to Donald MacLaurin, associate professor at Singapore Institute of Technology, and specialist in the hospitality sector. Mr MacLaurin points out that Mr Choe introduced a five-day working week, in a part of the world where six days is common, thereby showing \"a focus on quality of life issues for employees\". The associate professor adds says the early success of the business was remarkable given the timing of its launch. Fast forward to today and the company is now on track to operate 30,000 serviced apartments globally by 2019. That success, say Mr Choe's admirers, should make him something of a visionary.

That makes it the second-highest Thanksgiving debut of all time, behind Disney's Frozen, which took $93.6m (\u00a375.3m) on its release in 2013. Some observers have said that Moana and its merchandise are appropriating Pacific Island culture. Disney withdrew a children's costume promoting the film after activists branded it \"brownface\", or mocking of their culture by stereotyping. The costume, a full-body suit with brown skin, traditional tattoos, grass skirt and bone necklace, represented the character Maui, considered a demi-god and ancestor by many Polynesians. Disney said it regretted any offence. JK Rowling's Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them fell to second on the US chart, taking $65.8m (\u00a353m). Gossip surrounding Brad Pitt's marriage break-up failed to spark a huge amount of interest in his World War Two romance Allied, which also stars Marion Cotillard. It took $18m (\u00a314.4m) over the long weekend, having cost $85m (\u00a368.5m) to make, landing in fourth spot behind Doctor Strange.

The bill would allow a termination when doctors deem that a woman is at risk of taking her life. President Higgins must decide by Wednesday whether to sign the bill into law or refer it to the court. If the Supreme Court decides it is constitutional and approves the bill, it will automatically become law and its constitutionality could never be subsequently challenged. It the first time that President Higgins has convened the Council of State since he assumed office in November 2011. The Council of State is an advisory body that aids and counsels the president. The introduction of the legislation follows the case of an Indian woman who died in an Irish hospital after she was refused an abortion. The debate revealed deep splits in the predominantly Catholic country. Anti-abortion campaigners say that the bill will allow the intentional killing of the unborn for the first time in the Republic of Ireland. Others argue the bill is too limited as it does not allow for terminations in cases of rape or incest, or when there is a foetal abnormality or when the foetus cannot survive outside the womb. Since a Supreme Court ruling in the 1992 X case, abortion has been constitutionally available when a woman's life, as distinct from her health, is at risk from the continued pregnancy. X was a suicidal 14-year-old schoolgirl who had been raped by a neighbour and was initially prevented from leaving the country for an abortion in Britain. Since then, the credible threat of suicide is, constitutionally, regarded as grounds for a termination. But until now, no government in the republic has introduced legislation to give doctors legal certainty on when an abortion can be carried out. That uncertainty provided part of the context for the Savita Halappanavar case. She was a 31-year-old Indian dentist who was admitted to hospital in Galway in October 2012 while miscarrying. She died a week later from septicaemia. Her request for an abortion was turned down. Her inquest heard that she could not get a termination at the time because her life was not in danger but, by the time her life was at risk, an abortion would have been too late to save her.", "", "But Roma forward Mohamed Salah, who has been out with an ankle injury, is among the 27 names on the preliminary list.

Business travel in hi-tech facelift Can tech combat modern slavery? Battery technology playing catch-up Such digital technologies offer the potential to tackle some of the continent's chronic education challenges, including overcrowded classrooms, teacher shortages and the 30 million children in sub-Saharan Africa without any education at all. As Africa becomes ever more connected, educators and publishers are finding new ways to reach young audiences and develop their burgeoning minds. One such company is Via Afrika Publishers. First and foremost a publisher of textbooks for over 65 years, Via Afrika began to investigate the move to digital content several years ago. Its early adoption seems to be reaping dividends. \"We decided about three years ago, after looking at what was taking place in the world, that e-learning was an important direction to go in,\" says Michael Goodman, the company's group content manager. \"We decided to design a set of e-learning books that matched our printed books and indeed matched the books we submitted to the education department. It was a sort of 'build it and they will come' mentality, because there was no call for any electronic books to be submitted,\" he added. Mr Goodman points out that uptake has really mushroomed over the past year. While there were about 1,000 e-book sales in 2013, there have already been 64,000 in 2014, he says. But he admits that as the South African government has invested heavily in printed materials, a widespread shift towards e-learning will require partnerships between private enterprise and government. \"We are seeing pockets of co-operation,\" he says. \"Companies are coming up with their own initiatives in supplying tablets and then co-operating with government to implement them in schools. \"That needs to grow a whole lot. We feel that a very strong public and private partnership is needed to move us towards e-learning completely.\" Via Afrika has formed just such a partnership with a non-profit organisation, Breadline Africa, to provide rural communities with digital education centres. Breadline Africa is a Cape Town-based non-governmental organisation (NGO) that specialises in converting old shipping containers for community use. The digital centres are being developed inside existing libraries and each is supplied with 15 Android tablet devices loaded with Via Afrika's latest educational programmes, apps and electronic textbooks. The Via Afrika Digital Education Centre initiative is currently being rolled out in three primary schools in the provinces of Limpopo, Mpumalanga, and the Free State. \"I visited one school last week in Limpopo and to see how the kids have responded so positively in working with brand new media has been remarkable,\" says Mr Goodman. \"It's going to be interesting for us to see what the impact will be in a small rural school.\" One of the challenges is educating the teachers as well as the children. So the centres will receive regular visits and updates to keep the educators aware of the latest developments, says Mr Goodman. Look around one of these centres and you will see people consuming content and interacting online in a variety of social networking spaces. One such space is social learning platform Obami.com. The Cape Town-based firm is making waves with its brand of educational tools and online connections. Founded by Barbara Mallinson in 2007, Obami - which means \"my\" or \"mine\" in isiZulu - began as a generic social networking site. But Ms Mallinson soon saw the opportunity to refine the concept and have an impact upon a key issue in South Africa - education. \"We are all very aware of the education crisis going on in South Africa and beyond. Social media was being used in entertainment and for business but no-one was really doing this in education,\" she explains. Ms Mallinson and the Obami team wanted to see how social media in schools could be used to connect scholars, teachers and parents. The first pilot study \"went wonderfully\", she says, although the teachers remained wary of social networking for social networking's sake. \"We looked at it again and thought social networking is very useful in many industries but it has to serve a purpose, and so we decided to change a few things and ended up with this idea of social media being applied to a learning management system.\" This means uploading and sharing content, and setting and undertaking assignments, she explains. Sharing curriculum content online and monitoring learners through assessment were core principles \"bringing the platform to life\". Over the past few years, Obami has continued to grow across South Africa and the continent with about 400 schools and organisations now using the platform to connect learners and partners. As the platform is customisable it is equally suitable for an early stage learner as for an adult involved in distance learning, the company believes. It is accessible via PC, tablet or phone. \"Obami was traditionally a primary and secondary platform but we have now opened it up beyond schools,\" she says. \"We also found a demand from scholars whose schools weren't using the platform to get on to Obami, so we started our own school of sorts and now have nearly 4,000 individuals on the platform who can access its learning capabilities and content.\" Few believe technology for its own sake will be the knight in shining armour that helps South Africa and the continent educate its youth more effectively. But used strategically by educators, publishers and government working in partnership, it has the potential to achieve great things. And fast.", "The 19-year-old was taken off in the 15th minute at Vitality Stadium after appearing to pick up the foot injury. City said in a statement: \"He will undergo further examinations in the coming days to establish the extent of his layoff.\" The Brazil international, who completed a \u00a327m from Palmeiras in January, has played five times for City. Jesus was hoping to become the third City player to find the net on each of his first three Premier League starts, having scored at West Ham and two against Swansea. The other two players to have achieved that feat are former striker Emmanuel Adebayor and and current midfielder Kevin de Bruyne. Metatarsals are the five long bones in the forefoot which connect the ankle bones to those of the toes. The first is linked to the big toe and the fifth, on the outer foot, links to the little toe. Together, the five metatarsals act as a unit to help share the load of the body, and they move position to cope with uneven ground. Injuries usually occur as a result of a direct blow to the foot, a twisting injury or over-use. Medical experts recommend rest with no exercise and sport for four to eight weeks. The patient might be asked to wear walking boots or stiff-soled shoes to protect the injury while it heals. If the cause is over-use, then treatment can vary hugely. Training habits, equipment used and athletic technique should all be investigated. It all depends on the damage and which metatarsal bone is involved. It is impossible to put a timescale on recovery from a stress injury. With an impact fracture, after the plaster and protective boot is not needed (usually after four to six weeks), it will be a case of exercise and increasing weight-bearing activities. Ice packs, strapping and even the use of oxygen tents can be used to assist recovery. Full return to action can be anything from another four weeks and upwards - depending on the extent of initial damage. Young bones heal quicker.", "Anthony Scouler, 55, used seven bank accounts to hide profits of more than \u00c2\u00a3100,000, Exeter Crown Court heard.

Scouler of Barton Road in Bideford, Devon, admitted supply, production and personal possession of cannabis and having a shotgun without a certificate. He denied money laundering but was found guilty of eight out of 14 counts by a jury at Exeter Crown Court in February.

Recorder Michael Fitton said Scouler had grown cannabis on a \"moderate but commercial scale...producing two or three crops a year\" from 2010. \"You had a significant role. It may be you had the guidance of others and were doing this at the invitation of others but it was your enterprise under your control,\" he said. \"I also have to have regard for the dishonesty, the abstraction of electricity, the fraud and the use of specialist equipment. I accept you were of good character and under financial pressure.\" Mr Richard Crabb, defending, said Scouler had been drawn into growing drugs by others as the result of financial problems caused by his business failing during the recession.", "The final stretch of the $3.8bn (\u00c2\u00a33bn) pipeline is being built under a North Dakota reservoir. The Standing Rock Sioux and Cheyenne River Sioux tribes have filed a lawsuit against the pipeline, saying it endangers their drinking water. They also say the pipeline will damage sacred burial sites. The pipeline, when complete, is expected to transport about 470,000 barrels of crude oil a day from North Dakota to a terminal in Illinois, where it can be shipped to refineries. The developer, Energy Transfer Partners (ETP) has completed most of the pipeline, and began work on the final section after the army gave it permission to proceed on Wednesday. The Standing Rock and Cheyenne River tribes asked for a temporary injunction against construction, pending a lawsuit against the pipeline. They argued that the pipeline would hurt their water supply, and prevent them from practicing religious ceremonies at the lake. However, developer ETP and the army argued against an emergency injunction, saying there was time for the lawsuit to be heard before oil began to flow through the pipeline. Construction on the pipeline had stalled for months due to opposition from protesters. Thousands of predominantly Native American protesters have demonstrated against the pipeline's construction and set up camps along the final stretch. Nearly 700 people have been arrested since protests first began last year, according to law enforcement officials.

Police seized computers, mobile phones and sketches in the raids but did not find a \"smoking gun\", prosecutors' spokesman Martin Steltner said. About 450 officers were involved in the raids. One of the men detained, reported to be aged 35, had been living in a refugee shelter in the town of Attendorn, east of Cologne, and is wanted by the Algerian authorities for alleged links to IS. Police said \"investigations show that he has been trained militarily in Syria\". The man's wife, also wanted by Algeria, was detained at the same time but prosecutors said she was not a suspect in the German case. The suspect held in Berlin was arrested on suspicion of falsifying identity documents, police said. Two other Algerians in Germany, said by police to be \"from the jihadist scene\", were tracked down but not arrested. \"Our understanding is that the four men accused could have planned to carry out an attack together,\" Mr Steltner said.

Many mainland Europeans, Americans and Chinese people are taking advantage of that. That's clear from the cacophony of different languages and accents outside Buckingham Palace, and on the streets around the Palace of Westminster. \"It's a little more economical than it was a few years ago,\" says one visiting American tourist. \"Thanks to the euro, London is not more expensive than in France,\" a French tourist adds. Meanwhile, a German man said the euro-pound rate has \"made me quite happy\". Two-thirds of the international visitors enjoying London's sites, Cornwall's beaches and Edinburgh's Royal Mile are from the rest of the European Union. The tourism agency VisitBritain forecasts there'll be a 6% rise in the number of international visitors in 2017, with large numbers coming from France in particular. VisitBritain's director Patricia Yates says: \"The currency is in our favour. It might motivate more people to come.\" The tourism boom was helped by the Olympics in 2012, a showcase for Britain's historic towns, picturesque villages, and stunning national parks. The latest data from Forward Keys, which monitors flight bookings, suggests international arrivals to the UK will be 9% higher for August to October this year compared to the same period of 2016. Bookings from China are up 20%, and those from the US are 23% higher, the data suggest. There aren't just more tourists, they're also spending more when they're in the UK. VisitBritain predicts tourists' spending will surge by 14% this year. \"Very often people budget in their own currency. They're getting more pounds for their money, and we can see their spend going up,\" says Patricia Yates. Sterling has tumbled 16% against the euro since the June 2016 referendum, and has fallen 23% against the US dollar. Over the past two years, the pound has dropped about 30% against the euro. \"There are some factors putting downward pressure on the pound, and some other things putting upward pressure on the euro,\" says Paul Hollingsworth of Capital Economics. He lists the downward forces on sterling as \"Brexit and uncertainty about the UK's future relationship with the EU, the economy... and the expectation for interest rates\". \"We've seen quite a Brexit bounce,\" says Jace Tyrrell from the New West End Company, which represents shops on London's Bond, Oxford and Regent Streets. As shoppers carrying bags from all sort of stores rush by on Regent Street, Mr Tyrrell says, \"In the past six months, there's been a 36% increase in spend here, so certainly international visitors are appreciating the value depreciation\". Stores report sales of pricey jewellery and high fashion items have been rising the most. The large American hotel chain, Hilton, has 138 hotels in the UK, and is planning to open 30 more, partly because of the tourism boost spurred by the fall in sterling. The company says it has seen double-digit growth in the UK over the past year. In the lobby of one of its swanky London hotels, Simon Vincent, Hilton's president of Europe, the Middle East and Africa, says we're living through a \"golden age of travel\". Another factor behind the company's British expansion is demand from UK customers, as \"staycation\" becomes more popular. \"The domestic customer has always been an important part of our business mix, particularly in our portfolio outside of London,\" says Mr Vincent. \"In fact, it's the most significant proportion of our business. It's been growing well.\" Despite \"Brexit bounce\", the sharp increase in tourist numbers began before the sharp drop in the pound, and the industry says it isn't relying on currency depreciation to increase numbers further. \"We operate in a competitive global environment,\" says VisitBritain's Patricia Yates. \"We will never be a cheap destination, we don't want to be. We have to offer good value for the prices we're charging,\" she says.", "The Transocean Winner rig ran aground at Dalmore on Lewis in a storm while being towed to the Mediterranean.

The rig's grounding on 8 August sparked pollution fears due to the 280 tonnes of diesel on board.

But a Royal College of Nursing survey claims two-thirds of nurses wouldn't have studied nursing without them. They say it would make an existing staff shortage even worse. Bursaries are a means-tested allowance paid to those healthcare students who qualify, to help with living expenses during their training. Plans to scrap them were outlined by Chancellor George Osborne, as part of the government's Spending Review in November 2015. At the time he said the move would free up around \u00c2\u00a3800m a year in government spending and create up to 10,000 new training places. But since then, nurses and other health workers have been campaigning against the axing of bursaries. Student nurses are also going to have start paying tuition fees for their courses in the same way as other undergraduates - meaning they will have to take out a student loan. First year student nurse Ellie Archer has told the BBC that the bursary was vital in allowing her to pursue her dream career. She already has one sizeable student loan from another undergraduate degree and says: \"I really wanted to be a nurse and I can say without a doubt that if I had had to take out a loan to study to become a nurse, I would not have done it.\" Ellie believes the intensity of a nursing degree means students need extra support. \"Because of the amount of time spent on a placement it is very, very difficult to pick up second jobs, so there isn't really any other way of getting an income other than having the bursary in place.\" There is already a model of what a future without bursaries may look like at Chorley Hospital in Lancashire, which is part of the Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. Student nurses there, who are on a course run in conjunction with the University of Bolton, are the first in England to pay their own way and once they have successfully completed the course, they are guaranteed a job. The trust's director of nursing and midwifery Gail Naylor explains: \"We had 800 applicants for 30 places, so I think what that tells us is, there really is the demand out there. \"Students are looking for different ways to train and we've been really successful in that.\" The Lancashire course is not alone in being oversubscribed. In 2014, there were 57,000 applicants for places on nursing degree courses, but the NHS in England could fund only 20,000 places. The Royal College of Nursing says a survey of 17,000 nurses reveals that two-thirds of them would not have studied nursing if faced with the prospect of taking out a student loan. RCN chief executive Janet Davies says: \"We're concerned that perhaps we won't get the same diversity of people coming into nursing that we have currently, that having to take out a loan will put people off, particularly those people who are more mature, who may have had a career previously and who are coming into nursing as a second career.\" However, many of those who run nursing training courses believe there is a case for change. Dame Jessica Corner, chairwoman of the Councils of Deans of Health which represents the universities that train nurses, says: \"This change actually enables universities to open up training places. \"At the moment they are capped, really on the basis of affordability and estimates of what the NHS might need, which have clearly been wrong over many years. \"So over time we think training places will be expanded and that will be good news for the NHS with more nurses and allied health professionals graduating.\" There is a shortage of qualified NHS nurses right across the UK. So far these changes are only being proposed in England. But faced with similar problems, politicians in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will be watching very carefully to see what impact these changes will have.", "The main feature was a drop in bank shares. That came after the news that Deutsche Bank faces a $14bn penalty to settle an investigation by US regulators into the mis-selling of mortgage-backed securities. Shares in RBS fell by 4.4%, Barclays by 2.8% and Standard Chartered by 2.7%. Neil Wilson, from ETX Capital, said the Deutsche case could have serious implications for RBS which was \"among a number of European institutions that could face similar claims from the US Department of Justice\", he said. \"RBS could have to pay up to $13bn to settle the claims. \"Even a third of this figure could deliver a crippling blow to the lender, making its return to profitability even further off. It would also derail plans to return the bank to private ownership any time soon,\" Mr Wilson added. Among the main risers in London were TUI, up nearly 4%; Shire, up 3.2%; and Burberry, up 3%.

A 26-year-old man driving a Saab died at the scene. A 200m-length section across four lanes had to be resurfaced after a fuel spillage, Highways England said. Read more on this story and other news from Birmingham and the Black Country A Highways England spokesman said earlier: \"You've got about a 200m stretch - so that's 800m across all four lanes. \"Fuel has leaked on to the carriageway and it's really got into the carriageway, so that's the problem and it's just not safe to reopen.\" Traffic jams trailed back to junction four for the M42. Drivers were stuck for hours in congestion on the M42 north from junctions six to nine and on the A446 around Coleshill. Many of the main routes into Birmingham slowed to a crawl as people tried to find alternative routes. BBC Travel has the latest Two southbound lanes between junctions six and five, that were closed at about 03:00, reopened about six hours later. Two lanes closed on the northbound carriageway of the M6 at junction 3A near Coleshill after a separate traffic collision at 12:30 reopened by 13:00, said Highways England. Drivers expressed their anger on social media at being caught in the congestion in and around Birmingham during Thursday's rush hour. Paul Davis tweeted at 10:00 he had only managed to drive six miles after leaving from Sutton Coldfield at 07:00. Earlier Virgin Trains said it had advised its ticket managers at Birmingham International to use discretion towards commuters in light of the disruption. Police had hoped to reopen the northbound lanes at about 07:30 on Thursday, but Highways England said extensive damage had been caused and assessment and repair work was being carried out. Diversions were put in place but motorists were caught up in long delays on surrounding routes, particularly on the A38. West Midlands Ambulance Service said the lorry driver in the collision was shaken but uninjured.", "Kohli made 107 and shared century stands with both Shikhar Dhawan (73) and Suresh Raina (74) at the Adelaide Oval. When Kohli fell as part of Sohail Khan's 5-55, Pakistan looked to have dragged themselves back into the game by restricting India to a reachable 300-7. But a chase that never gained momentum was wrecked by a collapse of three wickets for one run and they eventually stumbled to 224 all out, Mohammed Shami claiming 4-35. In isolation, India's win earns national pride in what was billed as the most watched cricket match of all time, with an estimated television audience of one billion, and extends their World Cup record against Pakistan to six wins from as many matches. It was also an emphatic way to begin the defence of a trophy they won on home soil in 2011 and represents their first competitive win since arriving for a tour of Australia in November. Pakistan, winners when the tournament was last held in Australia and New Zealand 23 years ago, can take heart from the way they stuck to the task with the ball, but their limp chase was poor. After all the hype, the action was intriguing, rather than exciting. Making first use of an excellent pitch on a baking hot day, India's innings was underpinned by Kohli's calm accumulation all around the wicket, his 126-ball stay containing only eight fours. The right-hander made Pakistan pay for dropping him twice, the first a tough chance in the deep to Yasir Shah when on only three, the second a more straightforward edge behind to Umar Akmal from the spin of Haris Sohail on 76. When the 26-year-old punched Shahid Afridi to long-on for a 22nd ODI hundred - only Sachin Tendulkar has more for India - he became the first man to score a century in his opening match of a World Cup tournament on two occasions. Support came from Dhawan, who curbed his attacking instincts, and Raina, who repeatedly heaved through the leg side in his 56-ball knock. However, after Kohli edged Sohail to Umar, Pakistan fought back through fast bowler Sohail, who demonstrated consistency of length and canny changes of pace. India scored just 27 runs in their final five overs as five wickets fell, four of them to Sohail. A chase of 301 looked within Pakistan's grasp at the interval, but they never threatened to keep up with the six-an-over run-rate. Younus Khan, promoted to open, gloved a Shami bouncer behind early on and, though Ahmed Shahzad and Haris shared 68, Ravichandran Ashwin found turn with a beautiful off-break to have the latter caught at slip. And, when Umesh Yadav removed Shahzad and Saqaib Mahsood in the space of three balls followed by Umar controversially being given out, caught behind off Ravi Jadeja on review, the contest was effectively over. Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq did his best to delay the inevitable with some clean striking in his 76, but he was the ninth wicket to fall, to the lively Shami, before Mohit Sharma had Sohail caught at long-on to seal India's victory.

She goes to Chantilly next rather than the Oaks at Epsom, in which stablemates Enable and Coronet are top contenders. Tasleet (14-1) took the Duke of York Stakes for trainer William Haggas. Jim Crowley's mount won comfortably from Magical Memory in second, with Comicas third. Shutter Speed, whose last run at Newbury saw her beat Enable into third, brought a fifth Musidora win for both Gosden and Dettori. \"We got away with it. The ground was very soft. It was hard work for her,\" said Dettori. \"She'll be a better horse on better ground. She's top drawer. Everything she does is very classy.\" Gosden is concerned about the ground for his colt Cracksman in Thursday's Dante Stakes and will again walk the course before deciding whether he runs in the Derby trial. BBC Sport horse racing correspondent Cornelius Lysaght Shutter Speed's clearly in very good order and she coped well with the soggy conditions. She'll be off to France's Oaks, staged over 'her distance' of a mile and a quarter, and Gosden will rely on Enable and Coronet in the longer Epsom Oaks. The trainer said he was pleased to now have a month to prepare Shutter Speed for Chantilly. Meanwhile, the gap between Thursday's Dante Stakes and the Derby is just 16 days, so Gosden's colt Cracksman may not be asked to line up in what's sure to be an examining Dante, in terms of both quality and going.", "Stoneman, who resumed on 83, reached 111 before he was run out to leave the visitors 252-7, still 13 runs behind. Paul Coughlin (49) and John Hastings took them ahead, but both fell to Rikki Clarke after lunch and Keith Barker finished the innings with his fifth wicket as Durham were all out for 327. Warwickshire lost two quick wickets but Ian Westwood (32no) saw them to 63-2. The win, which earned the home side a maximum 24 points, saw them maintain their unbeaten start to the season in Division One, while Durham have now lost two games, but remain second. However, the match will be remembered primarily for Barker's efforts with both bat and ball as he narrowly missed out on becoming the first Warwickshire player since 1911 to score a century and take 10 wickets in a first-class game - as his 5-103 gave him match figures of 9-157. Resuming on 189-4, still needing 76 runs to make the hosts bat again, Clarke removed skipper Paul Collingwood lbw early on although the former England batsman looked from from impressed with the decision. Stoneman soon brought up his first century of the season from 179 balls, but Durham were further in trouble when the out-of-form Phil Mustard edged Barker to William Porterfield at third slip. Then, just as it looked he would take Durham into the lead, Stoneman was farcically run out from the non-striker's end as he went for a single, but was sent back by Coughlin and 17-year-old substitute fielder Aaron Thomason swooped to send the ball back to Jeetan Patel who whipped off the bails. Coughlin and Hastings upped the scoring rate before lunch with a fifty stand, but any hopes of saving the game were extinguished shortly after the interval when both were out to Clarke (3-61) in the same over. Barker ended the innings when he had Chris Rushworth caught by Clarke to finish with his 10th five-wicket haul in first-class cricket. Requiring just 63 for victory, but without captain Varun Chopra who was hit on the leg while fielding, the hosts soon found themselves 12-2 after Porterfield fell third ball and Jonathan Trott was run out. Westwood and Laurie Evans steadied any nerves to see their side home in 17.4 overs. Warwickshire all-rounder Keith Barker: \"In these last two games we have been more 'Warwickshire' than we had before and hopefully we can carry that on. \"I think we will always be up there or thereabouts in Championship cricket especially. \"It is just a question of getting on a roll and making sure we are in contention towards the end of the season.\" Durham coach Jon Lewis: \"We were pretty positive this morning. We felt that with six wickets left we were in with a chance of making something of the day. \"Mark played really well but the run-out wasn't a great piece of communication, and unfortunately Mark was the victim. \"It's a busy time coming up but we've shown resilience before. I'd like to not have to show resilience after defeat but that's something we're going to have to do.\"", "It is thought about 400 people in Northern Ireland live with permanent disabilities after surviving gun and bomb attacks. Those injuries include amputations, paralysis and blindness. They did get compensation, but they say it is now running out. Some victims now rely entirely on benefits. Because they could not return to work due to their injuries, they have not built up work-based pension savings. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) is presently preparing a bill to go through Stormont to put a special pension in place for them. Current victims' legislation in Northern Ireland from 2006 does not judge how someone became injured. It is argued that means former paramilitaries should be eligible to get this pension if their injuries are serious enough. It is thought 10 former paramilitaries fall into this category. More could come forward if the pension scheme goes ahead. But the DUP say their proposed bill does not need to rely on that current definition of a victim. They plan to exclude anyone with a terrorist conviction. Ernie Wilson was a school bus driver and member of the Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR). In 1988, his bus was blown up by the IRA in Lisnaskea. He suffered injuries to his legs and eyes. He says no paramilitaries should be entitled to the proposed victims' pension. \"My message is pay the people that have been injured by the terrorists. Full stop. \"I know the men that are injured have to live, they have to get food, they have to get clothed, they have to be looked after. \"But they should not be getting a pension for trying to kill me.\" Yet the BBC's Spotlight programme has learned that the injured paramilitaries have support from some surprising quarters. Paul Gallagher was 21 when the loyalist Ulster Freedom Fighters (UFF) took over his house with the aim of killing a republican who lived nearby. When they could not find their target, they shot Paul six times. He was left paralysed from the waist down. He told Spotlight that allowing injured paramilitaries to avail of the pension was a price worth paying. \"It's a tough one. Say somebody was seriously injured, even by their own hand, they have needs now. So, I mean, they need to be looked after. \"If they go forward to the NHS they are not going to be turned away at the door. \"So why should they be turned away at the door of maybe the victims and survivors' service or other sorts of services? \"For me, it is as simple as just looking at human suffering really as the qualification for eligibility or even to be recognised as a victim.\" Sinn F\u00c3\u00a9in told Spotlight they would not support the DUP bill if former paramilitaries are to be excluded. Spotlight was broadcast on BBC One Northern Ireland on Tuesday 2 June, and is available on the iPlayer.", "The takeover of the Gulls by Swindon-based Gaming International (GI) was confirmed on Tuesday. Prior to the deal being finalised, Nicholson had said he was unsure what it meant for his own future. \"They have got to show that they are in it for all the right reasons, and they assure me that they are,\" the 36-year-old told BBC Radio Devon. \"I spoke to them very openly and honestly, making them aware their takeover has not been overly positively taken (among fans). They're aware of that. \"These guys have got a lot to prove but they have technically saved Torquay United right now.\" Nicholson, who has been in charge since September 2015, continued: \"They've got to gain the trust of thousands of Torquay fans.\" \"We're going to sit down and put together a five-year plan and then we're going to hold a forum as soon as possible so that these fans that are worried can come in.\" Torquay are currently 17th in the table, and play Forest Green Rovers at home on Boxing Day, before a trip to Gloucestershire for the return game to start the new year.", "In Theresa May's letter triggering Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty she states: \"We believe its necessary to agree the terms of our future partnership alongside those of our withdrawal from the EU.' But Donald Tusk responded today: \"Starting parallel talks on all issues at the same time as suggested by some in the UK will not happen.\" Bluntly, the divorce bill would have to settled before talks on trade can begin. What's more, only one party to the break-up, the European Council, would decide if the settlement is good enough. This rebuff was always likely, and the Downing Street response restrained - in effect, reminding us we were simply at the beginning of the negotiating process. So no flames fanned, but it may not be long until Theresa May feels the heat. Ahead of a divided Labour Party in the polls, she may be at the zenith of her political popularity. Because now her own party's apparent unity is set to be tested. If some of her own MPs don't like the size of any proposed financial settlement, they may not only suggest it's better to walk away with no deal, but attempt to apply pressure to this end. That in turn might lead to the largely self-muting Remainers in her ranks to find their voice. And there are more time bombs in Tusk's draft guidelines. If Theresa May wants a transitional deal, she will have to accept a \"supervisory\" regime for a time - presumably the European Court of Justice whose jurisdiction she wants to end. So UKIP are likely to claim by the next election that we are still \"half-in, half out\". And with the EU refusing to do a final trade deal until after the UK has left, it may be difficult for her to demonstrate the benefits of leaving - allowing the Liberal Democrats to claim we should never have cast aside single market membership in the first place. It's an old political adage but one with which Theresa May will be familiar: \"you cannot please all of the people all of the time.\" But she may find it a challenge to please some of the people some of the time, even in her own party.", "Sheridan only took over as manager at Rodney Parade on Friday after Terry Butcher's departure the previous day. He saw his side fall behind to Exeter when Joel Grant took Jordan Moore-Taylor's cross and cut inside to score. But Newport fought back as John-Lewis pounced after Troy Brown blocked Alex Rodman's initial effort. Newport County manager John Sheridan told BBC Wales Sport: \"We played very well, I couldn't have asked any more from the players. \"The endeavour and some of the football we played at times was really good. \"It's always difficult when you're bottom of the league, you're always looking up at everyone and it was a difficult game against Exeter, I've always liked the way they play. \"But the players really responded to the new manager coming in and they gave me a performance I was really pleased with.\"", "The Labour authority voted in favour of changing 2,700 contracts from 52 weeks to term time-only. The council said it would bring staff in line with the other 17,000 workers and \"reduce the risk\" of staff making claims for equal pay. Union Unison said it was \"bitterly disappointed\" with the decision. Regional officer, Helen Metcalf, said: \"This is a devastating blow for the 2,700 teaching assistants in the county, who now face being driven into poverty and relying on food banks through losing \u00c2\u00a3200 - \u00c2\u00a3400 per month of their salary.\" She said there was \"no option\" but to lodge a formal dispute and ballot members for industrial action. Teaching assistant Tony Lowery, said: \"It is really devastating for my family because I'm the main wager. I don't mean things like going on holidays or a second car, I mean things like food on the table and clothes on our backs.\" Liberal Democrat councillors voted unanimously against the plans. Councillor Owen Temple said the affected staff would \"find themselves the poorest teaching assistants in the North East\" and the council was \"very likely to face legal challenge\". The council's corporate director of resources, Don McLure, said there was a \"real risk\" that, under the present contracts, other council employees could make claims for equal pay with the teaching assistants. He said: \"I fully understand the position teaching assistants are in but they are very valued, they do a great job and support the education of our children, but we are doing this to bring them in line with the rest of our workforce.\" He said two consultations with assistants and the unions had failed to find agreement but it was hoped further discussions would resolve the matter without strike action being taken.", "Miss Beckford, who came to the UK from Jamaica aged 17, was also a prominent race equality campaigner. Marvin Rees said he was \"very sad\" to hear the news and hers was \"a life very well lived\". The former midwife, who was the first black recipient of an MBE in the South West, died at a care home in Bristol earlier this week. She helped set up the St Pauls Carnival in 1967, was appointed the first Race Relations Officer in Bristol and also worked alongside the bus boycott campaigner Paul Stephenson, to improve racial equality in the city. Councillor Asher Craig announced Miss Beckford's death and told Bristol24/7: \"She was a beautiful woman and had a heart of gold. \"She was extremely stylish and was an amazing networker who had all the skills and expertise of a socialite, which she capitalised on in her role as the entertainments officer on the board of St Paul's Carnival. \"The legacy of Carmen Beckford's contribution towards helping to create a more equal and integrated city must never be forgotten and I will ensure that it lives on.\" Miss Beckford is one of \"seven saints of St Pauls\" who will be commemorated in giant murals, due to be painted by artist Michele Curtis this summer. The portraits of prominent black Bristolians will be painted on houses or prominent buildings along the route of the St Pauls carnival procession.", "The capsule, a metal box about the size of a shoe box, was discovered buried deep inside part of Ruthven road bridge near Kingussie in the Cairngorms. In the box was a folded newspaper from September 1894, a paper scroll and the bottle. The items have been donated to a museum in nearby Newtonmore. Workers from construction and infrastructure company Morgan Sindall uncovered the capsule during work to replace the bridge under a contract from Highland Council. Robert Ogg, of Morgan Sindall, said: \"It is fascinating to think these items have been sitting in the bridge's structure for 121 years. \"The changes which have occurred since it was placed there are extraordinary. If you think that the bridge was being used by horses back then, it gives you a sense of the time which has passed.\" He added: \"We have actually been working with Kingussie Primary School to create our own time capsule which we hope will last as long.\" The Highland Folk Museum has taken the 1800s artefacts. The single-track road bridge spans the River Spey and links the B970 to Kingussie and the trunk road network.

Work on the bridge is expected to be completed later this year.", "A two-hour walkout on Friday by the examiners will be followed by a week of short strikes in the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA). The Public and Commercial Services union said more will be held throughout June at the Department for Transport (DfT) head office and several agencies. The DfT said contingency plans were in place to keep vital services running. The PCS union said the planned closure of Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) offices would \"wipe out the high quality face-to-face services these offices provide to the public and motor traders\". The closure of eight of the UK's 18 coastguard stations would mean \"the loss of life-saving local knowledge\", it added. But the government said the changes to its coastguard provision would modernise the service. PCS general secretary Mark Serwotka said: \"With unemployment high and our communities suffering as a result of the government's cuts, ministers should be providing all the help they can to local economies that are crying out for support and investment. \"Instead they're ploughing on with entirely unnecessary and unpopular cuts to vital transport services. \"These strikes across the whole range of transport services form a major part of our ongoing fight against cuts to pensions, jobs and pay.\" The PCS said more than half of its members had backed walkouts with four out of five supporting industrial action short of a strike. Mark Peacock, head of BSM driving school, said: \"Taking your driving test is a big day and can be nerve-wracking enough without the thought of strike disruption. \"However, candidates who have chosen to keep their test booking for the afternoon of 8 June should still attend their test so it can go ahead if possible.\" The DfT said it was \"disappointed\" at the decision to strike while it was still in discussions with the union. The MCA said those striking would be staff responsible for co-ordinating rescues and \"the rescuers themselves will continue to operate as normal\". Helicopters would continue to fly and the RNLI would still send out its lifeboats, a spokeswoman added. Last week, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) staff voted to take industrial action over jobs and privatisation after a third of workers took part in the ballot. The PCS represents 55,000 members in HMRC, including tax advisers and call centre staff. The union says thousands of jobs face the axe over the next few years on top of 30,000 posts already lost since 2005. PCS members were involved in a 24-hour UK-wide strike by public sector workers last month over government changes to pensions. The union is one of the largest in the UK with around 250,000 public sector members.", "The government announced in 2014 that it wanted to build a tunnel alongside the World Heritage site. But Highways England is also considering a route which would take the A303 south of the city. A \u00a32bn 1.8-mile (2.9km) tunnel is the government's preferred option at Stonehenge but some archaeologists argue it could damage the ancient site. In an email, seen by the BBC, Highways England suggests a southern bypass route would be \"considered\" as part of the \"design consultation\" phase of the upgrade. Last week, Atkins/Arup was awarded a \u00a317.5m design contract for the scheme. The group will be \"developing options\" to upgrade the road - including that of a tunnel - with the aim of construction work starting in 2020. \u00a31.4bn Proposed cost of Stonehenge tunnel 1.8 miles is the length of the proposed tunnel (2.9km) 9.6 sq m around Stonehenge is a World Heritage site (25 sq km) 33% of the route is single carriageway 84 years since the A-road opened There are growing concerns over congestion on the A303 which has been described as \"highly detrimental\" by English Heritage, which manages the monument. However, a group of historians - called the Stonehenge Alliance - has called for \"no further damage\" to the world heritage site. Historian Tom Holland, from the group, said the southern option was \"better than ploughing through the richest archaeological site in Europe\" and called for \"lateral thinking\" over A303 congestion. And Icomos, which advises UN cultural body Unesco, said it was \"concerned\" any upgrade could have a \"highly adverse impact\" on the World Heritage landscape around the stones. Both English Heritage and the National Trust have given their support to the option of \"the longest tunnel possible\". In a statement, Highways England said: \"As part of our public engagement we are committed to considering the alternative routes that are being suggested and will look at these as part of our engagement work. \"The improvements are currently at an early stage of development. As we develop our proposals in compliance with the statutory processes, we will consult a variety of stakeholders, including local residents, businesses, road users and interested parties. \"We are aiming to start a wider and public consultation in early 2017.\" A similar tunnel scheme for the route, which links London and the South West, was dropped in 2007 because of the spiralling cost. The government said the cost of a bored 1.3m (2.1km) tunnel could not be justified at \u00a3540m - double the initial estimate of \u00a3223m.", "It is hoped it will help recognise the \"vital role\" of those educating and caring for children aged up to seven. Education Minister Huw Lewis said the Welsh government's draft 10-year plan would help support \"raise the status\" of early years carers. Since 2008 children aged between three and seven have been educated through the play-based Foundation Phase. Reports into the effectiveness of the programme in May said that while it was having a positive impact on how children learned, it varied between schools and raised concerns about how well children were being prepared for exams later on in their education. The draft plan will go out to public consultation until 15 December and should be published next April. It would cover everyone who works with children in both state-run schools and nurseries and private childcare settings. The plan wants to see staff highly skilled and \"highly regarded\" in their career, who understand children's development, help all children to meet their potential and are bilingual. Mr Lewis is visiting a staff training session at Herbert Thompson Primary School in Cardiff to unveil the plan. He said: \"The ages of 0-7 are a crucial time in every child's development. \"It's important, therefore, that individuals like those I will meet today, that play such a key role in supporting children during these important years, receive the right level of support, are highly motivated and skilled and feel that they are valued. \"We're determined to raise the status of careers in early years, childcare and play to a level which better reflects the vital role these practitioners play in supporting children's development.\" Some of the proposals include: Communities Minister Lesley Griffiths said: \"We owe it to our future generations to get this right. \"If we reach our goals we will improve the lives of young children, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds.\"", "And even one of those three times  - when it bought 250 million chocolate selection boxes from Woolworths following its  collapse - was a deliberate ploy to attract the retailer's customers to its stores. It's a story that reflects just how Poundland, despite the cheap and cheerful image,  is a tightly managed business. Poundland might look a bit basic - the ultimate in pile-it-high, sell-it-cheap - but this is a sophisticated firm with big plans for expansion. And its growth is part of a wider UK success story: the unstoppable rise of the discount retailers. Overall, the discount sector - including Poundland and its smaller rivals such as Poundworld and Poundstretcher, as well as the  fast-growing supermarket chains Aldi and Lidl - has grown 48% over the past five years, according to retail research firm The Local Data Company. This compares to the slower 34% expansion of the big four supermarket chains - Tesco, Morrisons, Asda and Sainsbury - over the same period. In fact, last year discount stores grew twice as fast as the big four supermarkets with each chain opening an average of 33 shops compared to the 16 opened by each of the bigger players. This growth in a much improved economy seems surprising, but analysts believe the recession started a much more fundamental shift. Maureen Hinton, global research director for retail research firm Conlumino, says the careful habits initially borne of necessity have now become entrenched, with people realising they don't have to pay a lot to get good quality products. She also credits the straightforward everyday pricing strategy of the discounters, compared to the \"opaque\" costs of their bigger rivals for their continuing popularity. \"There's a genuine honesty with pound stores. People have discovered there's the opportunity to buy good stuff at low prices so why pay more?\" she says. Poundland's customer data backs this up. Far from a shop just for people struggling to make ends meet, it claims to have successfully converted the middle class with a quarter of its customers now from the \"AB\" demographic - the wealthier end of the population. The discounters are also benefitting from a backlash against their bigger rivals: they're are seen as a welcome outsider, says Dimitrios Tsivrikos, a consumer and business psychologist at University College London. \"The cheap environment, low staffing and basic shop fit outs all help. People think there's no danger here and let their guard down,\" he says. And conversely, because customers believe that there's no hidden agenda they spend more. \"The no gimmicks, no frills, 'here we are saving money' message means people buy a lot more just because no one is trying to convince them to do it,\" he adds. In reality, he says people overestimate their ability to understand pricing, with the low pricing creating \"a level of euphoria and excitement\" that interferes with rational decision making, with \"bargain\" signs helping to create a sense of urgency. \"We are hardwired to feel more euphoric, the hunter gatherer instinct pushes us to buy with our shopping driven by missing out rather than acquiring what we need.\" To take advantage of this, most of the discount stores stock a smaller constantly changing range on top of standard staples. Chris Edwards, the boss of Poundworld, says its bestselling products  are \"everyday grocery items\", including baby wipes, crisps and chocolate. But he says the chain, which has 280 shops nationwide, each week changes 500 of the 5,000 items it stocks to \"keep up with trends\", such as a range of Minions products to tie in with the forthcoming film release, and give customers \"new and exciting offers\". The chain has also recently launched an online shop, aimed at expanding its reach. Poundland's Mr McCarthy says it is \"reasonably well advanced\" with similar plans, but it is also aiming to rapidly expand its physical presence. It is using the funds from last year's \u00c2\u00a3750m flotation on the London Stock Exchange to open more stores with a bullish long term target of opening 1,000 UK stores up from its current network of over 500 stores across the UK and Ireland. A \u00c2\u00a355m deal to buy smaller rival 99p Stores and convert their shops into Poundlands, which is currently being reviewed by The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), would dramatically hasten its growth. And in contrast to what you'd expect, Mr McCarthy says the \"good times\" are actually much better for sales. \"We've been going for 25 years and seen two recessions. In good times people feel more confident and go on more shopping trips which means we get more business\". He is equally upbeat about the firm's growth prospects, pointing to the success of US discount chain Dollar Tree, which has been going for half a century, for proof of Poundland's potential longevity. But others are less certain, warning that the growth of the discounters has an obvious limit. \"If there are five pound shops on the high street, people are not going to spend five times as much. They are in danger of reaching a peak,\" warns Ms Hinton. Still, it remains hard to resist the lure of the bargain. Mr McCarthy admits that even he is not immune to the store's charms - describing it as a \"Pandora's box treasure trove\". He buys phone charges, Toblerone chocolate bars and biographies. \"It's very difficult not to be compelled to buy,\" he says.", "Media playback is not supported on this device The Abbey Stadium delivered a thunderous roar as referee Chris Foy sounded his final whistle to confirm Cambridge - lying 12th in their division and 76 places below their Premier League opponents in the football pyramid  - had secured a money-spinning replay at Old Trafford. And even though United had the better chances, with Cambridge keeper Chris Dunn saving brilliantly from Radamel Falcao and Angel Di Maria and substitute Robin van Persie off target - no-one could begrudge them a second crack at Louis van Gaal's side. Media playback is not supported on this device Cambridge have almost been rebuilt as a club, returning to the Football League this season after a nine-year absence, and this performance was testimony to all that work as they more than matched the Red Devils until tired legs inevitably took their toll late on. And now that process will continue in \"The Theatre Of Dreams\" as they survived the meeting with a visiting side lacking the spark of captain Wayne Rooney, and failing to create any serious openings until the second half. Van Gaal, whose side battled thought a third-round meeting with Yeovil Town, will have been bitterly disappointed with his team's lacklustre display - even though they are still overwhelming favourites to reach the fifth round. United, who rested Rooney and Juan Mata, lacked creativity during a laboured first 45 minutes in which they were more than matched by Richard Money's underdogs. Money made no secret of his plan to unsettle the Premier League side, with seven players crammed into the six-yard area in an attempt to make life difficult for goalkeeper David de Gea with sheer weight of numbers. And with Phil Jones a symbol of that uncertainty, the obvious ploy almost worked on the half-hour. Manchester United failed to clear a corner and the ball was smuggled off the line before a header from Cambridge defender Josh Coulson landed on the roof of the net. Falcao's struggle for goals has been the focus of much attention but it was hard not to sympathise with the Colombian as he struggled in the face of poor service, which even when it did arrive was nearly always too pedestrian. Media playback is not supported on this device He finally got his chance just after the hour, when Michael Carrick delivered a forward pass of quality. Falcao applied a powerful finish but drew an equally strong one-handed save from Dunn. Van Gaal had seen enough and made changes, sending on Van Persie and Ander Herrera for James Wilson and the ineffective Marouane Fellaini. And Van Persie almost answered the call right away when he ran on to Di Maria's astute pass on the angle but directed his first-time effort over the top. Cambridge had given so much that it was inevitable fatigue would play a part in the closing minutes - and so it proved - but goalkeeper Dunn was once more the hero, punching clear crucially before recovering to block Di Maria's goalbound effort, surrounded by players in the area, It was the final moment of concern - leaving Cambridge's fans to celebrate wildly and savour the prospect of a trip to Old Trafford. Cambridge boss Richard Money: \"We've said in the dressing room you're going to Old Trafford. Who cares what happens? Just go and enjoy it, soak it in. Whatever happens, happens. \"(It is) difficult to put into words just how proud we are. When you get back in the dressing room and recover, you just suddenly start to think about what it means to so many people. \"This club has been in the doldrums for 10 years, out of the Football League, and suddenly here we are taking everybody back to Old Trafford.

He had laid bets against a horse knowing its jockey aimed not to win. Ackerman was granted a stay of implementation in November, but his disqualification has been reactivated with immediate effect until 11 June. However, his fine of \u00a35,000 was quashed upon appeal, at the invitation of the British Horseracing Authority. Ackerman was banned after an investigation into six races featuring Ad Vitam at Kempton and Wolverhampton between 2 November, 2011 and 8 March, 2012. He was found to have breached the rules of racing alongside jockey Michael Stainton, registered owner Kenneth Mackay and former owner David Greenwood. Stainton was banned for two years, Mackay for six months and fined \u00a35,000, with Greenwood, who had already been warned off for a separate offence, banned for eight years. All three also failed in their appeals, although, a separate appeal by Stainton against the penalty imposed \"will be considered in due course\". Stewart-Moore Solicitors, who represent Ackerman, Greenwood and Mackay, said in a statement that the \"matter needs to be resolved by a High Court judge\". \"Messrs Ackerman, Greenwood and Mackay have not acted in breach of the rules of racing in any way,\" they added. \"In spite of this they have been found, yet again, to have taken part in a conspiracy that has never been properly put to them.\"", "Most migrants were said to have relocated to accommodation in refitted shipping containers but some moved their tents further inside the camp. Authorities want to clear the area next to a motorway for security reasons. Riot police have been overseeing the operation which seemed to be happening without incident. The move is part of a new housing project in attempts to improve conditions in the camp, which is used by about 5,000 migrants and refugees. The 125 converted containers are equipped with electricity, heating and bunk beds, and each one can accommodate 12 people. Officials had given between 1,000 and 1,500 residents until last Thursday to leave the area, but they were reportedly given a grace period until Monday. But many migrants and refugees had refused to use the new accommodation and moved their temporary homes further inside the camp, despite poor living conditions. Many reportedly feared they could be permanently trapped at the new camp, unable to continue their attempts to cross to the UK. Some also expressed their unhappiness about leaving an area where they have established a community, and are concerned about their future treatment by the authorities. \"This (the container camp) is the same as a jail. It is not good,\" one resident told the BBC. Volunteers helped residents to move their tents from the area in recent days.

Prolific Chris Rushworth (4-37) and Graham Onions (3-41) proved too much to handle for the Championship leaders. But Sidebottom (4-44) led the way as Durham were dismissed for 156 in reply, with Yorkshire 10-0 at the close. Yorkshire went into the game with a 34-point lead over Warwickshire, but soon found themselves in dire straits on 54-5. Gary Ballance's hopes of finding form after being omitted from England's Test squad came to nothing as he made six from 27 balls before being caught at slip off Onions. Glenn Maxwell's 36 was the only score of any note before Bresnan and Sidebottom came together at 95-9. Bresnan was eventually bowled by Paul Harrison, but then struck the first blow in Durham's reply when Graham Clark gave a catch to point. With Paul Collingwood absent because of a back problem, acting skipper Mark Stoneman was caught hooking at long leg and 18-year-old debutant Jack Burnham was bowled by Liam Plunkett for a four-ball duck. Durham's decline continued, with Sidebottom taking three of the last four wickets, including Ryan Pringle for 40, as their innings lasted just two balls longer than Yorkshire's. Umpires Nick Cook and Jeremy Lloyds confirmed after the match that they were happy with the way the pitch had played and would not call in a pitch liaison officer. Yorkshire bowler Ryan Sidebottom: \"It was certainly a bizarre day's cricket and I don't think I have played in one on day one like that before. \"I thought we batted pretty poorly in the morning with some poor shot selection but they also bowled well. What a fightback it was by our boys who needed to get us back into the game and now the momentum is in our favour but Durham are still a good side. \"It was a good wicket with carry and bounce but if you put the ball in the right areas at Scarborough you are always in the game although this was still a bizarre day.\"", "Media playback is unsupported on your device 8 May 2015 Last updated at 10:28 BST During the war, families would have to ration their food and had little communication in their homes.

Hamilton failed to complete a clean lap on his qualifying simulation on the ultra-soft tyres and ended up seventh. He finished his session early because of a recurring hydraulic problem. Hamilton was unable to do any of the race-simulation runs the teams do in the second part of the session on heavy fuel loads. He was also unhappy with the balance of the car on the ultra-soft tyre that was used for the fastest runs, although Mercedes believe they should be able to solve that problem with set-up changes. Hamilton, who is two points ahead of Rosberg in the world championship, is nevertheless heading into the weekend at a disadvantage. However, he can console himself with the knowledge that he had been fastest of all after the first runs in the session were complete, before he started to run into difficulties. \"We had a small hydraulic issue at the end of FP2 but it doesn't look like anything serious,\" said Hamilton. \"The guys are working on it and it should be fine for tomorrow, which is the main thing.\" Media playback is not supported on this device The evidence of the day was that Mercedes are not struggling in the same way as they did last year in Singapore, when their previously dominant car was more than a second off the pace of Ferrari and Red Bull. Listen again: A look ahead to the Singapore Grand Prix But, considering the long 3.15-mile lap, the margin between the world champions and their closest challengers is much smaller than normal. Verstappen was 0.380secs off Rosberg's pace, with Ricciardo just 0.025secs further adrift after recovering from a spin during which he brushed the wall without major damage. Verstappen was running a Renault engine upgrade which will not be available to Ricciardo until Saturday and which team boss Christian Horner said was expected to be worth in the region of 0.1secs a lap. And on race pace, Red Bull appeared to have an advantage but the picture was not completely clear. \"We knew they wouldn't have a massive gap here this weekend,\" said Ricciardo. \"We know if we get it right we can be very close in qualifying.\" Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel was fifth quickest after an unconvincing qualifying simulation run, 0.7secs slower than Raikkonen and a second slower than Rosberg. Vettel's problems put him back in the mix with the midfield runners, headed by Force India's Nico Hulkenberg in sixth. Toro Rosso's Carlos Sainz was eighth, ahead of Fernando Alonso's McLaren, a position with which the former champions are likely to be a little disappointed. They expected to be battling for seventh behind the big three, but Alonso was 0.6secs slower than Hulkenberg. The Spaniard's team-mate Jenson Button, meanwhile, was struggling - he was three places and a whopping 0.795secs behind Alonso, who is admittedly at his absolute best around the challenging Singapore track. Alonso had to park his car on track at the end of the session after encountering a gearbox problem.

Although that and 20 other allegations out of 31 were not upheld, the independent investigation did find he died of hospital-induced pneumonia. Ms Clwyd maintained she would be \"vindicated\". Results of the review show nine of her allegations were entirely upheld and one partially. But 17 were rejected, 11 were not upheld due to insufficient evidence and two were rejected because of insufficient information. A second independent review is now taking place to examine the findings. Among the upheld allegations in the report were responses to the following comments by Ms Clwyd: However, those allegations not accepted by the investigation included claims by Ms Clwyd: Other allegations not accepted included \"almost every request I made was ignored or dismissed\" and \"I saw a nurse in the corridor and asked her why my husband wasn't in intensive care. She just said, 'There are lots worse than him'\". Up until now, the results of the investigation - carried out a year ago - went unpublished. But parts of the report were released under a Freedom of Information request. Ms Clwyd told BBC Wales the report summary should not have been made public, especially while another investigation is under way. She disputed there was insufficient evidence for her claims, and said she had additional evidence. She said: \"I think that when the other investigation is concluded then my views will be substantially vindicated.\" By Tomos LivingstoneBBC Wales political correspondent This case has led to a huge political row. We ended up with the extraordinary situation of a Labour MP, Ann Clwyd, being criticised by the Labour First Minister, Carwyn Jones, for failing, in his view, to provide evidence to back up her claims. At the same time, we recently had the Welsh Conservative Party conference in Llangollen and delegates there standing and applauding Ann Clwyd for the work she had done campaigning for better standards of care in the health service. There is a general election of course coming up next year - health care standards are already a central part of that campaign, not least perceived differences in standards between Wales and England. So we are going to hear a lot more about the political row this case has caused and we are going to hear a lot more about the individual case itself, I think, with a second investigation now on its way. The health board has denied breaching confidentiality and said the details released were statements already in the public domain. A health board spokesman said: \"We would like to make quite clear that the health board has not released the full report and it is not our intention to breach any confidentiality. \"The investigation into Ms Clywd's concerns was overseen by an expert independent panel and completed in April 2013. Since then the health board has received a number of requests under Freedom of Information legislation to release that report. As part of that standard process Ms Clwyd's permission was sought to release the full report but that was refused.\" The spokesman said it sought legal advice before releasing the summary. He said: \"Based on that advice the health board believes it would be in breach of its statutory duty not to release the summary report.\" The release of the report summary follows a dispute between Ms Clwyd and the Labour Welsh government. First Minister Carwyn Jones has told Assembly Members the MP provided \"unattributable\" comments about the NHS that \"can't be investigated\". But Ms Clwyd insisted she had provided Mr Jones with a comprehensive summary of complaints raised.

No bombs were found at any of the centres targeted with telephone calls. Last week, 27 Jewish community centres in 17 US states reported receiving hoax bomb threats. All of the threats made on Monday, along with previous incidents in January, turned out to be false and Jewish centres have since reopened with normal services resumed. Responding to the latest incidents, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said that US President Donald Trump had made it \"abundantly clear\" that such actions were \"unacceptable\". \"Hatred and hate-motivated violence of any kind have no place in a country founded on the promise of individual freedom,\" the statement, which was shared on Twitter by NBC News correspondent Peter Alexander, said. Mr Trump's daughter Ivanka - who has converted to Judaism and whose husband is Jewish - also condemned the threats. Former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said that action must be taken to prevent further incidents. In a post on Twitter, Mrs Clinton wrote: \"JCC threats, cemetery desecration and online attacks are so troubling and they need to be stopped. Everyone must speak out, starting w/@POTUS.\" The threats were made to the Jewish community centres through calls that were both pre-recorded and live, with suspects using voice-disguising technology, according to Israeli newspaper Haaretz. Since the beginning of the year, there have been reports of threats to centres in New York, New Jersey, Ohio, Florida, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Delaware, Connecticut, Alabama, California, Maine, Tennessee, South Carolina, Missouri, Wisconsin, Texas and Kansas. The JCC Association of North America, a network of health and education centres, has since been reviewing its security plans.

Tomas Rosicky hit the bar after the break but the Championship side scored when Kazim-Richards followed in on Martin Olsson's shot. Theo Walcott was denied late in the game as Arsenal's hopes of ending their eight-year trophy drought were dented. \"Blackburn just kept believing they could get something out of this game. \"The amount of pressure Arsenal were putting on them at the end was relentless. Grant Hanley and Scott Dann will not have played a better game this season, or even in their entire careers. \"An outstanding performance from Blackburn.\" The Gunners could not find a way through Blackburn's defence as Michael Appleton's team defended for their lives at the end of the game. Mikel Arteta was another Arsenal player who shot off-target. It means Arsene Wenger's team have only the Champions League left if they are to win silverware this season, having already been knocked out of the Capital One Cup by League Two side Bradford in December. Appleton has already lost in the FA Cup this season, when in charge of Portsmouth, and was manager at Blackpool in the third round when they drew with Fulham before the 37-year-old left the club. But he has overseen a transformation at Ewood Park during his short time at Rovers, who were relegated from the Premier League last season. This victory extended his side's unbeaten run to six games after suffering defeat by Charlton in his first match in charge on 19 January. Blackburn are yet to concede in the FA Cup this season and have now reached the quarter-finals for the first time since 2007 and sit six points off the play-off places in the Championship. Having made seven changes to the side which defeated Sunderland 1-0 last weekend, it was clear Wenger had one eye on Tuesday's Champions League tie against Bayern Munich. But the Frenchman may live to regret waiting until 70 minutes had passed before bringing on substitutes Walcott, Jack Wilshere and Santi Cazorla as his side chased the game at 0-0. Gervinho returned from an impressive Africa Cup of Nations tournament with the Ivory Coast to start his first Arsenal game since that penalty shoot-out loss to Bradford on 11 December. Unfortunately, his biggest contribution in a first half dominated by the Gunners was to drag his shot wide when he was put through by Rosicky after 41 minutes. For all their possession in an opening period where Arsenal had 12 corners, Wenger's team did not forge many openings. And when they did, the impressive Blackburn goalkeeper Kean saved headers from Abou Diaby and Thomas Vermaelen, who returned to the side after injury. Kean also stopped Olivier Giroud's effort after the break with Jason Lowe's header Blackburn's best effort up until the hour mark. Rovers brought on former Gunner David Bentley to try and make an impression, but it seemed to rouse the home supporters before Rosicky smacked a long-range shot against the bar. That was his last meaningful action as Wenger brought on his trio of substitutes to try and avoid a replay in an already-congested month. But Blackburn went ahead two minutes later. Wojciech Szczesny could only palm Olsson's angled shot away and Kazim-Richards's scuffed rebound went in off the post. It was a stunning blow by the Rovers striker, a boyhood Arsenal fan. Walcott injected some much needed urgency into the Gunners' play and his header from Wilshere's cross could not breach the Blackburn rearguard as Appleton's side held on for a famous victory. Blackburn manager Michael Appleton: \"Colin Kazim-Richards has been fantastic for the last five games and has played in a couple of different roles. \"I am delighted he got the reward for all of his work, it was not his greatest of strikes, but I think he was just trying not to welly it into Row Z and got the bit of luck he deserved. \"I had a brief stint at Blackpool when I ended up with a 1-1 draw at Fulham in the last round, then was lucky enough to win at Derby, but this is the icing at the top of the cake.\" Full Time   The game is over, as the referee blows his whistle.

One family complained to the Local Government Ombudsman over the council's response to the evacuation and subsequent work on the road. The council agreed to pay \u00c2\u00a35,000 compensation to the family. Emergency services helped residents leave their homes on Undercliff Drive - between Niton and St Lawrence - following the landslip after heavy rain in February 2014. The road was closed with properties only accessible on foot.  In 2016, a temporary route to provide full access for local residents was created. Council statements in the years following the landslip insisted householders were \"an absolute priority\" and said they would be \"fully informed of progress\" on road works. The ombudsman's report said: \"I also have seen no persuasive evidence to show it properly planned and adequately managed the situation.\" It also said its road plans were \"disjointed and reactive\" and it did not give \"timely and clear responses\" to householders. Delays in carrying out work were blamed on a \"lack of effective liaison and project planning\". The ombudsman said the unnamed family, some of whom had long-term medical conditions, suffered \"avoidable distress\" due to the council's actions. The council was also ordered to help pay the family's costs in returning their house to a habitable condition. A spokeswoman said: \"The council has worked with the family to ensure that the recommendations of the report are being met. \"The family is now living in their home and work to meet the recommendations remain ongoing, in close consultation with the family, as required.\"", "Ministers and other government officials are being given a three-month deadline to hand over state-owned homes and vehicles, from the date of the new president's inauguration. The law targets presidential appointees who try to cling on to the perks of office after a new leader is elected. Ghana goes to the polls on 7 December. After previous transfers of power, some officials have had to be forcibly evicted and had their state-owned vehicles seized after failing to hand them back. The law does not apply to presidents and vice-presidents as we earlier reported. The bill, which was passed by MPs on Wednesday evening, will now go to the president to sign into law. Existing legislation requires officials to hand back government property after they leave office, but this is the first time a strict time limit has been applied.

Fury, 23, looked fresh throughout and picked his opponent off at ease to earn a wide unanimous decision. Two judges scored the fight 117-112 with the other scoring it 118-111. \"This is a dream come true and it means the world to me,\" said Fury. Victory for the unbeaten Fury -  the 15th of his professional career  - could now open the door to a potential world title shot against either of the Klitschko brothers. Wladimir Klitschko, WBO, IBF and WBA champion, openly discussed the prospect of facing the winner in the build-up to the Wembley Arena showdown, and now Fury can dream of a shot at the big time. This is a dream come true and it means the world to me Chisora has had two proposed bouts with Ukrainian Klitschko cancelled within the past eight months but he looked a long way short of a fighter ready to mix in such exulted company. Manchester's Fury started the fight on the front foot and looking sharper than 27-year-old Chisora, who looked rusty and like a boxer that had not fought for nearly a year. And certainly Chisora's pre-fight weight of 18st 9lb - the heaviest of his career - seemed to suggest the Finchley-based boxer had taken a less than professional approach to training for the fight. It was the Fury jab that proved the most effective punch, with his short clubbing left also finding the target throughout. The previously unbeaten Chisora rocked Fury in the second and had his man in trouble in the third and fourth but the challenger cleared his head and dominated from there on in. Fury boxed well throughout, throwing some beautiful combinations while never looking like ending the fight early, with Chisora cutting a battered, bloodied and disheartened figure as the fight wore on. At one stage his corner threatened to pull Chisora out of the fight in an attempt to spark him into life, but it made little difference. He was constantly worn down by Fury's physical dominance and relentless work rate and despite a 30-second burst from Chisora in the 10th, he never looked liked turning the fight around. The champion knew he needed a stoppage in the final round but he lacked energy and intensity as Fury managed to keep the disappointing Chisora at length to take the fight and British and Commonwealth titles on points. Ashley Theophane overcame a difficult start to stop Welsh veteran Jason Cook in the 10th round of the first defence of his British light-welterweight title at Wembley Arena. Cook, whose career record slips to a potentially final 28-4-1, unsettled the Londoner early on with some intelligent pressure fighting and Theophane's frustration was clear when he was docked a point for low blows in round five. But the champion, now 30-4-1, regrouped, finding his range with a number of sharp combinations before flooring his foe conclusively with a left hook to the body in round 10.", "Officers were called to Leith Walk at about 06:00 following reports about a man with a neck injury. Detectives said it was believed he sustained the injury sometime between 05:30 and 06:00 in nearby Smith's Place. He was taken to the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary where his condition was described as serious but stable. Det Sgt Neil Spowart said: \"We're working to ascertain the full circumstances surrounding this man's injury. \"We believe that he was in a business premises on Leith Walk, near the junction with Balfour Street, at around 5am and that the injury was sustained sometime between 5.30am and 6am. \"Anyone who remembers seeing a man in the Smith's Place area around this time, or has any information which may be able to help us establish the cause of his injury, is urged to get in touch.\"", "The Woodland Trust's annual contest will decide which specimen represents the country in the Europe-wide event. The final winner of the England heat will be decided by public vote. This year's list includes yew trees, ancient oaks, hawthornes and the sycamore under which the Tolpuddle Martyrs first met. Experts at the Trust whittled down 200 public nominations to four shortlists for each country in the UK, with the winner from each region competing in the European event. The Scottish list includes an oak said to have been visited separately by both William Wallace and Rob Roy, while Northern Ireland's list includes an avenue of trees used in Game of Thrones. Meanwhile the Welsh list includes two of the oldest trees in the UK, reputed to be almost 5,000 years old. Calke Park is a haven for ancient trees with the oldest an oak called The Old Man of Calke, thought to be between 1,000 and 1,200 years old. The average age of a large oak in the UK is about 200 years. This ancient yew could be 2,500 years old and is close to the site where King John sealed Magna Carta at Runnymede - although some argue it was under the Ankerwycke tree's shadow. It is also said to be the spot where Henry VIII courted Anne Boleyn. This tree in St Martin's Church, Martindale, Cumbria is believed to be at least 800 years old. The nearby church has a bell with an untranslated Nordic rune cast into it and an altar apparently made from meteorite. According to legend Joseph of Arimathea, an uncle of Jesus, thrust his staff into the ground at Wearyall Hill in Somerset where it took root as a hawthorn tree. It was chopped down in the Civil War but descendants survive at Glastonbury Abbey from where a flowering spray has been sent to the Monarch each Christmas since the 17th Century. A recent survey revealed many of the trees in Linford Manor Park are more than 300 years old and are considered significant because of their relationship to the design of the 18th Century grounds. This venerable oak is a descendent of the tree the future King Charles II hid in following his defeat at the final battle of the English Civil War in 1651 at Worcester. The young Charles attempted to flee to Wales but had to seek refuge in Boscobel where he hid first in a tree and then in a priest hole. In 1834, six farm labourers were sentenced to seven years in an Australian penal colony after a meeting under a large sycamore in Tolpuddle to talk about falling wages. There was a public outcry and their actions laid the foundations for trade unions. The large hollow tree - estimated to be 330 years old - is now a place of pilgrimage for trade unionists. The black poplar is one of the rarest native trees in the UK, with only 2,500 thought to be left. This fine example is in the grounds of Acklington School and is estimated to be between 250 and 300 years old. It was saved from felling in 2010. Believed to be over 250 years old, this is thought to be the largest wild pear tree in Warwickshire and the second largest in the UK. The tree sits on the proposed HS2 route. The tree has grown outside the house of Judith Clark in Litherland for 27 years. Ms Clark is housebound and said it had enriched her life greatly as she watched the changing seasons.", "Jamal Hakrush starts his job as deputy commissioner after months of violence between Israelis and Palestinians. He will oversee policing in Arab communities where there is a longstanding distrust of the police. A fifth of Israel's population is Arab and they often complain that areas in which they live are not so well policed and have poorer public services. Their grievances have been supported by Human Rights Watch which in recent years has published several reports highlighting the discrimination which it is argued the Arab population faces. Deputy Commissioner Hakrush, from the Galilee village of Kafr Kanna, will be in charge of a newly-created police division established to improve policing in Arab communities, The Times of Israel reported. Deputy Commissioner Hakrush was formally appointed into his new position on Wednesday at a ceremony attended by Police Commissioner Roni Alsheich. One of his main responsibilities will be to stop illegal weapons falling into the hands of the Arab community. Mr Alsheich also wants to reduce domestic violence, murder rates and other crimes in the Arab sector. He and the government wants to recruit 1,300 new officers and construct several new stations in Arab population centres.", "The think tank's UK growth forecast for 2016 has been cut from 2.3% to 1.9%, and from 2.6% to just 0.4% for 2017. Meanwhile its forecast for GDP growth for 2018 was slashed from 2.4% to 1.4%. Its report said the Brexit vote would have \"severe confidence effects on spending and business investment\", which would lead to anaemic GDP growth over the next three years. However, the drop in the value of the pound could bolster exports by 3.4% next year, the Item Club said, with imports falling by 0.3%. Overall, the move would see net exports adding 1.1% to GDP in 2017, it added. Brexit 'will be horrible for UK economy' - fund manager Peter Spencer, chief economic advisor to the EY Item Club, said the UK economy was set to suffer a severe loss of momentum in the second half of this year. \"Heightened uncertainty is likely to hold back business investment, while consumer spending will be restrained by a weaker jobs market and higher inflation,\" he said. \"Longer-term, the UK may have to adjust to a permanent reduction in the size of the economy, compared to the trend that seemed possible prior to the vote. But amongst the gloom, the weaker pound provides one silver lining to exporters, particularly those selling to the US and emerging markets.\" A new survey from Deloitte found 82% of chief financial officers of both FTSE 350 and large privately owned companies expected to cut capital spending in the next year. That was the biggest proportion on record and more than double the 34% in the first quarter, Deloitte said. Its survey was conducted between 28 June 28 and 11 July, after the EU referendum and just before Theresa May became the new prime minister. Almost all the CFOs surveyed said the level of uncertainty facing their businesses was higher than normal. Ian Stewart, Deloitte's chief economist, said: \"Perceptions of uncertainty have soared to levels last associated with the euro crisis five years ago.\" Leading City fund manager Richard Buxton, chief executive of Old Mutual Global Investors, has said the Brexit vote would have a \"horrible\" impact on the UK economy, which could \"judder to a halt\". The Item Club's Mr Spencer said that there were some positives ahead, including the UK retaining full access to the EU's single market in the short-term. As well as the fall in the exchange rate offering export opportunities, he said the predicted increases in inflation and unemployment would allow the economy to rebalance away from consumption. The Item Club also predicted that unemployment would rise from 5% to 7.1% by late 2019.", "Neil Aspin's promotion-chasing hosts have not lost in nine National League matches while Adam Lockwood's side are unbeaten in five.

The idea from the Park Hack community partnership aims to generate more investment in parks and open spaces. The council said the booking fees would help maintain the park and other open spaces, and community groups could book the space free of charge at weekends. Groundwork London environmental charity is delivering the project and said between six and eight people would be able to hold meetings or work on laptops in the weather-proof structure, which will be built around the tree. Workers will be able to see across the square and up into the canopy, as the office will be as \"transparent as possible\", Hackney Council said. The tree office has been designed by Australian-American artist Natalie Jeremijenko along with \"collaborative artists\" Shuster and Moseley, and architect firms Tate Harmer and Gensler. It will be launched at the biennial 2 Degrees Festival to celebrate art, environment and activism and will be available to book for seven months initially. A statement on the festival website reads: \"This tree offers sanctuary, a power supply, and free Wi-Fi amongst the bustle of east London. \"The workspace is owned and operated by the tree itself, with revenues made being reinvested into Hackney's parks.\"", "The politics is also apparent in the newspaper sales figures for the first half of the year. Out this week, they show the average decline at more than 10% since the first half of last year, continuing the industry's painful downward trajectory. Scotland on Sunday saw print sales fall more than 20%. It now has an average weekly sale of less than 25,000. It doesn't have its own staff any more, relying on a journalism pool shared with its stablemate, The Scotsman. \"SoS\" is now being beaten by the only weekly \"regional\" paper to register a rise in print sales, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulation. The Sunday Herald looked to be on its last legs, but found a niche by backing the independence cause. Approving \"Yes\" campaigners backed it, with a big lift in the back half of last year, from which it's fallen back, but still retained an average 29,000 weekly sales. Its publisher, Newsquest, also saw a gap in the daily market for pro-independence readers. Although the figures aren't audited, we're told they're selling nearly 17,000 a day. These are small numbers when set alongside the total sale of newspapers. The constitutional debate may have polarised opinion and changed some buying behaviour, but it can be overstated. The decline of sales in Scotland has recently been steeper than those for the rest of the UK, but the trends are similar. Meanwhile, publishers point out there's a rise in online readership. But that's not making them enough money to sustain their cost bases. In the case of the Scotsman's figures, daily online readers are down 33% since a busy referendum period. Those news publishers are competing with broadcasters for online readers. We've just got half year figures for STV which show  it aiming to achieve its turnaround by the end of next year. A high priority is the desire to find a new earner from making drama series, as royalties from Taggart re-runs fade to black. It's finding the transition and investing in new services can be expensive, with an \u00c2\u00a3800,000 half-year loss on its two city stations, STV Glasgow and STV Edinburgh. They're being watched by 900,000 people in the average month which, we're told, is 30% of the potential audience. The Glasgow channel is being aimed at break-even by the end of this year. STV also lost a wad of cash by having to bail out Mirriad, a digital advertising firm in which it invested. It may have failed to raise the finance needed without the bail-out, but it's clever stuff, \"advertising to the skip generation\", with personalised product placement embedded in video content. For instance, a music video might have a street scene, in which a background billboard has ads which differ, depending on who is viewing. Advertising is not part of the BBC debate. Not yet anyway. But as the future of the licence fee is discussed, they are a sort of subliminal presence on the background billboards. A project, financed by the BBC and published this week, sought to find out how small groups of people responded to living without the corporation's TV, radio and online content for a few days. It concluded the group who resented having to pay the annual \u00c2\u00a3145.50 missed it more than they expected, and some were despairing at the impact of adverts on their viewing of commercial channels. Commissioning that research is part of the BBC's fight for its very existence, at least if you believe some of the interpretation of the government's green paper on how the next 10-year charter is going to change things. The charter is due to start from the end of next year. We're half way through the consultation on that, and so far the UK government appears to have retreated from the early briefings to delighted print rivals that Auntie might as well be put in a retirement home, her funding clipped, with a remit to leave popular entertainment to the commercial market-place. Culture Secretary John Whittingdale has been in Edinburgh for its International TV Festival this week, making reassuringly supportive comments about the BBC. He'll be aware that it has a lot of fans mobilised to defend it, including some formidable cultural celebrities. Some, including Armando Ianucci and Sue Perkins, used the Festival platform to sound off. The context of the debate on the BBC's future in Scotland is, of course, rather different. The broadcaster's fans have not rushed forward to argue the case for it. The independence referendum seems to have left a bruised legacy of reluctance to engage. It also left a legacy of a starkly changed political landscape, to which the BBC has to respond, even if Mr Whittingdale's green paper didn't make much of it. The document only noted the Smith Commission's agreement that the BBC should be answerable to Holyrood on a similar basis to its accountability at Westminster (note that it's accountable for its management and use of resources, rather than its output and journalism). On the pro-independence side, there's some tacit awareness that the broadcasting section was hardly the most compelling part of the Scottish government white paper. It proposed a new Scottish broadcaster while somehow ensuring that all the popular BBC stuff was retained. Less tacit are vociferous critics of the BBC's political coverage, including pro-independence websites and bloggers, some threatening mass non-payment of the licence fee. Having mobilised protests outside the BBC last year, that element continues to be fired up by Alex Salmond, in his newspaper column and promoting his book, with ever stronger condemnations of the BBC's referendum coverage. The body set up to represent viewers, listeners and readers, the Audience Council of Scotland, took 10 months to produce a report that reflected on the referendum. When it did, it was both supportive and quite challenging of the corporation's coverage. It said online was of \"exceptional quality\" (including something called \"expert economic analysis\" - though if there was, I missed it). But it also said coverage failed to respond to the change in campaigning style, as grass roots and social media played such a significant role. The Council pointed to \"an opportunity to review issues in the light of experience in the referendum\", though it stopped short of explicitly calling for one. So that was the complex background to Alex Salmond's successor, previously with little to say on the subject, setting out her thoughts on broadcasting, and the BBC in particular, with a speech at the TV festival. Nicola Sturgeon said she approached the subject with trepidation. Her speech was very carefully worded. It's hard to believe this was anything like the speech Alex Salmond would have delivered. Criticism of the BBC's campaign coverage last year was measured. The first minister said she saw no \"institutional bias\", and praised at least some BBC Scotland journalism. She went on to argue that there was a failure to strike the right balance between holding independence plans up to scrutiny on a parallel basis with the prospects for remaining within the UK. \"The status quo and the consequences of voting 'No' were not really analysed at all,\" she claimed, voicing the irritation of those who feel there wasn't a level playing field. And she cited the Audience Council in support of her view that London-based journalists had failed to catch the mood of Scots audiences. Their broad brush reports jarred, it was argued, with the detailed scrutiny of issues that had long been debated at every level of Scottish society. BBC management responded to her speech with a statement beginning: \"We believe our coverage of the referendum was rigorously impartial and in line with our guidelines on fairness and impartiality\". The Sturgeon speech then turned its focus on the future. For her followers, it's worth noting a change of direction - no longer talk of a Scottish Broadcasting Service splitting from the BBC, but a federal structure. The design appears to allow for either devolution or independence. That way, it helps to disarm Ms Sturgeon's constitutional opponents in their claims that an independent Scotland would be deprived of Eastenders, Strictly Come Dancing and Sir David Attenborough. The governance requires a Scottish board of overseers, she said, while the output requires a Scottish TV channel (in addition to BBC Alba in Gaelic), and a sibling station for BBC Radio Scotland. Her most forthright criticism was of the BBC's past attempts to avoid becoming a leader of constitutional change by refusing the pressure to split its flagship network news coverage, at 6 and 10 o'clock, for a different perspective from Scotland for Scots. \"The criticism that should be levied at the BBC is not that it has tried to lead constitutional change,\" said the first minister. \"It is that it has totally failed to follow it. \"The UK has changed dramatically since devolution, but broadcasters are still catching up with its consequences. And although that poses questions for all public service broadcasters, the issue is maybe most acute with the BBC.\" The message was aimed at Mr Whittingdale to some extent, but more so at the BBC. So how will it respond? Last month, the official answer to concerns about a lack of trust was to point to large audiences for the flagship news programme, Reporting Scotland. And even last month, these were \"early days\" for a debate about changes to governance. Not any longer. Not with a BBC Trust survey finding that only 48% of Scots think that the corporation reflects their lives. That's lower than other parts of the UK. That BBC spokesman's reaction to the first minister's speech continued: \"We recognise that there is audience demand for greater representation and portrayal of Scottish audiences on all BBC services and we want this to be part of our response in charter review. \"The BBC's funding has now been set for the next five years and this will mean cuts across the BBC. \"We will have to balance our investment on pan-UK services with dedicated services in the Nations (Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland). We will aim to protect spending in the Nations so that content investment is cut less than in other parts of the BBC.\" Expect more on that from the Beeb next month. With the first minister's speech, an important debate on the future of the media in Scotland has only (at last) just begun.", "Heard, 30, filed for divorce in Los Angeles Superior Court citing irreconcilable differences. They married 15 months ago and have no children. They have recently been embroiled in a legal case in Australia after Heard took two dogs into the country illegally. She pleaded guilty in April to a charge of falsifying documents. Depp, 52, and Heard met while co-starring in the 2011 film The Rum Diary. In the court papers, Texan-born Heard listed the separation date as Sunday. Celebrity news website TMZ reported that Depp had asked a judge to reject Heard's claim for spousal support. The split comes days after the death of Depp's mother. His latest film, Alice Through the Looking Glass, is due to be released on Friday. The Australian court case started last year when Heard brought two dogs into the country where her husband was filming the latest movie in the Pirates of the Caribbean series. When the case was settled, the couple released a video apology expressing remorse and advising travellers to respect Australian quarantine laws. However, Australia's Deputy PM Barnaby Joyce had threatened to have the dogs put down, triggering a war of words with Depp that lasted for months. The actor recently said on a US TV show that Mr Joyce looks \"somehow inbred with a tomato\". Mr Joyce responded by saying he was \"pulling strings\" in Johnny Depp's head, like film villain Hannibal Lecter.", "The 18-year-old was found in Caldy Walk, Islington, shortly after 18:00 BST on Wednesday and died a short time later in hospital.

It also wants to build a manufacturing plant in Scotland, creating up to 500 direct jobs and 1,000 supply-side jobs. Renfrew-based Steel Engineering aims to double its 120 staff by opening a new plant and building a mini-port for ships on the River Clyde. By Douglas FraserBBC Scotland Business and Economy Editor It's taken a lot of huffing and puffing, but at last the economic wind turbine is turning. And it looks good for Clydeside that it has attracted four large multi-national firms to locate key bases there. Mitsubishi and Scottish & Southern Energy have a joint centre for engineering excellence in Glasgow, Iberdrola has opted to put its international renewables planning centre near its ScottishPower subsidiary. Also from Spain, Gamesa has opted for Glasgow as a research base, while looking at Dundee for manufacturing and logistic support. The biggest commitment so far is from Doosan Power Systems, a subsidiary of the vast Doosan conglomerate based in South Korea. It is new into the wind turbine business, though it's not new to green energy research, as a partner with Scottish & Southern Energy on early stages of commercialising carbon capture and storage. The research and development centre comes first, with 500 jobs to follow in a turbine manufacturing plant. So far Scotland's only had one such plant, near Campbeltown, and it's had a troubled couple of years, with three owners. So Doosan's statement of intent is a sign that the green jobs potential and hopes may be moving towards reality. The jobs announcements were made by both companies, who were visited by First Minister Alex Salmond. Doosan intends to locate its research and development centre for renewables at its current site at Westway in Renfrew, creating up to 200 jobs. The Korean firm is also in talks with the business development agency, Scottish Enterprise, to set up manufacturing and assembly facilities in Scotland - its favoured location for wind turbine development and production. Doosan expects its offshore wind plans in Scotland to create up to 1,700 new jobs. The firm aims to directly recruit about 700 new staff, with a further 1,000 employed in associated supply companies. In a separate announcement, Steel Engineering, which is also based at Westway in Renfrew, said it aimed to create 120 jobs by expanding its business servicing a range of clean energy sectors, including offshore wind, wave and tidal power. The firm is getting a \u00c2\u00a31.8m government grant towards the \u00c2\u00a33m investment. Steel Engineering is also in talks with Skills Development Scotland about developing a training school with Anniesland College in Glasgow. This would aim to provide training tailored to the latest fabrication techniques, and welding procedures required by the renewables industry. Mr Salmond said both announcements were \"great news for Renfrew and for the wider Scottish economy\". He described the Doosan initiatives as \"another great stride forward for the renewables industry in Scotland - which is now the chosen destination for three energy engineering giants to design their next generation of turbines to service the global offshore wind industry\". The first minister added: \"Scotland also plays a key role in the energy industry supply chain and Steel Engineering are an excellent example of how Scottish companies with great experience servicing the offshore oil and gas industry have been building the renewables side of their business.\"", "Crews were called to the incident at about 17:00 on Friday. Five appliances were initially sent to the scene with one remaining on site on Saturday afternoon. No-one was injured in the incident.", "The Private Infrastructure Development Group (PIDG) has also built up a \u00a327m surplus after the British government ramped up its donations. The NAO has urged ministers to keep a much closer eye on the PIDG's spending. Recent projects funded by the agency include a steel foundry in Nigeria and a Ugandan hydropower scheme. The PIDG said it had revised its travel policy, which had seen board members claiming for more expensive flexible business class tickets. But Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Commons Public Accounts Committee, said the Department for International Development (DfID) was to blame for not keeping a tight enough rein on spending. \"It's outrageous that 15 flights were booked from 2011, each costing over \u00a35,000,\" said Mrs Hodge. \"Only this month has PIDG revised its travel policy. DfID should get a grip on administrative costs like this.\" The PIDG was founded in 2002 by four countries - the UK, Switzerland, Holland and Sweden - to back private investment in infrastructure projects in developing countries, including roads, telecoms, sanitation, housing, agriculture, power and industry. But the UK provides 70% of its funding, which is expected to hit \u00a3700m in total by 2015. UK funding for the agency was increased fivefold by the coalition government in 2011, in line with its policy of encouraging private investment in the developing world. But the NAO found much of that money had yet to be spent on development projects and the PIDG Trust was sitting on \u00a327m in its bank account. Amyas Morse, head of the National Audit Office, said: \"The Private Infrastructure Development Group is providing important benefits to poor people in difficult environments, but DfID does not have enough good evidence  to show that funding PIDG is the best option. \"Furthermore, DfID's financial control has been lacking, allowing the PIDG Trust to hold nearly \u00a327m worth of DfID funding since 2012. \"The department has recently made good progress in tackling these issues, which will put it in a better position to demonstrate value for money, but I consider that it should have taken more action earlier given its decision in 2011 to increase funding for PIDG fivefold.\" The report also criticises two of the agency's subsidiaries, GuarantCo and the Emerging Africa Infrastructure Fund (EAIF), set up by then UK Prime Minister Tony Blair in 2002, which are incorporated in the tax haven of Mauritius. This arrangement has come in from criticism from War on Want, which claims it flies in the face of Prime Minister David Cameron's commitment to tax justice for poor countries. The NAO said it \"raises reputational risks\" for DfID. A spokeswoman for DfID said: \"The NAO has recognised that we are already improving the group's operations to drive even more job-creating private investment into developing economies, which is the only sustainable way to end dependency on aid. \"Since 2012 we have agreed new financial controls including value for money rules which restrict business class travel and ensure funds are only committed when projects are ready.\"", "The New Zealander, 19, is one shot behind joint leaders Brooke Henderson and Lee Mi-rim after two rounds at the Sahalee Country Club, Seattle. Canadian Henderson, who led after round one, hit a two-over 73, while South Korean Lee had a 69 to reach two under. Scotland's Catriona Matthew is three behind on one over par after a 67. Matthew's three-under score was the lowest of the round on a tough scoring day, on which early sunshine gave way to cool temperatures and rain. Only five players are under par at the halfway stage of the second women's major of the year with Americans Gerina Piller (69) and Brittany Lincicome (70) joining Ko on one under. Ko, who won the ANA Inspiration in March to add to her victory in the Evian Championship last September, said: \"If it wasn't for my putter I know I wouldn't be in this position.\" Henderson, 18, said she was \"happy\" despite dropping a shot at the 18th to lose the outright lead. \"It was a tough day and the conditions made it difficult, I hung in there,\" she added.", "However the Social Democrat (SPO) Christian Kern said he could not work with any groups that \"incite against people and minorities\". He was sworn in on Tuesday, replacing Werner Faymann who quit after losing the support of party colleagues. The SPO were trounced in the first round of presidential elections last month by the Freedom Party. The vote was won by the far-right party's candidate Norbert Hofer, who faces a run-off against the Greens' Alexander Van der Bellen for the mostly ceremonial role. It was the first time since World War Two that candidates from Austria's two main parties, the centre-left SPO and the centre-right People's Party, did not make it to the run-off. Mr Hofer has suggested that if elected he could use his power to dismiss the government of the day under certain circumstances. At a news conference, Mr Kern said working with the Freedom Party was possible if certain criteria were met, without specifying what they might be. He added: \"My plan is not to lead the SPO into opposition, the opposite is true. \"But at the end of the day we need an identity and for us it is absolutely unimaginable to work with parties who incite against people and minorities.\" Swearing in Mr Kern at a ceremony in Vienna, outgoing President Heinz Fischer said: \"You are taking on a great and beautiful but also difficult role with a lot of responsibilities.\"", "The Toffees, back in the tournament for the first time since 2010, controlled much of the game as a Ricardo Rodriguez own goal and a Seamus Coleman header gave them a 2-0 half-time lead. Leighton Baines put the game beyond Wolfsburg with a second-half penalty. Kevin Mirallas drilled in a late fourth for Everton before Rodriguez grabbed a consolation with a curled free-kick. The win puts Everton top of Group H and was just reward for manager Roberto Martinez, who underlined his intention to take the competition seriously by naming a strong side, after calling it \"the perfect next step\" for the club. The Toffees narrowly missed out on the Champions League last season as they finished fifth in the Premier League, but with their participation in this season's Europa League ending a four-year absence, Martinez has expressed a determination to go as far as possible. Everton's attacking display on Thursday will certainly give him confidence of progressing from a group that also contains French side Lille and Russians FK Krasnodar. Martinez had opted not to rest any of his first-team regulars for the visit of Wolfsburg, naming the same side that defeated West Brom 2-0 in the Premier League on Saturday. Romelu Lukaku got his first of the campaign in that game and the striker spearheaded an exciting, attacking quartet that also included Aiden McGeady, Naismith and Mirallas. They have all contributed to Everton's impressive statistic of having scored at least two goals in every game this season, and it was of little surprise they each played significant roles in the goals against Wolfsburg. Naismith was the first to make a telling contribution, forcing the opener with Everton's first attack. After winning possession, Naismith ran into the area to receive a Baines pass before stabbing a shot at goal. Rodriguez tried to clear, but the ball cannoned off goalkeeper Diego Benaglio, and hit the Wolfsburg full-back again before ending up in his own net. That was Everton's first goal in Europe at Goodison Park since beating Sporting Lisbon 2-1 in February 2010, and it had the buoyant home crowd hungry for more. Everton duly attempted to deliver, with full-backs Baines and Coleman becoming more adventurous as Wolfsburg offered little going forward, and their attacking instincts resulted in the home side's second goal on the stroke of half-time. Mirallas's drive was weakly pushed into the path of Baines, who had followed the shot into the area, and he knocked the ball across goal for Coleman to nod in. Wolfsburg boss Dieter Hecking introduced Germany midfielder Aaron Hunt for the start of the second half, but within seconds of the restart Everton went further ahead. This time, Robin Knoche's foul on McGeady was deemed to have occurred inside the area, and Baines confidently despatched the resulting penalty. The goal effectively ended Wolfsburg's hopes of returning to Germany with anything to show but, with nothing to lose, they embarked on a spell of dominance. For a good 30 minutes they enjoyed the lion's share of possession and attempts on goal, as Tim Howard produced saves from Luiz Gustavo's opportunistic shot and Rodriguez's well-struck free-kick. Former Arsenal striker Nicklas Bendtner was introduced after the hour, with Wolfsburg boss Hecking sensing a possible goal, but instead it was Everton who grabbed a fourth. Mirallas peeled away from defenders to run on to substitute Samuel Eto'o's through ball and he coolly slotted in at Benaglio's near post. There was still time for Wolfsburg to get the consolation their 27 shots on goal deserved, Rodriguez making some amends for his early own goal with a curling free-kick. Everton boss Roberto Martinez: \"The atmosphere was perfect for us to start a very good performance. \"I thought there were two very good sides. On the night the scoreline probably doesn't reflect the difference between the two sides. \"We scored at the right times. Our work-rate was magnificent. We had to defend and we did that really well but every time we went forward we had a clinical touch about us.\" Wolfsburg boss Dieter Hecking: \"It's obviously not the start we'd hoped for. We were lacking in certain areas, both in terms of finishing and defensive work. \"We should have gone into half-time a goal down and we got hit with a second just before the break. Straight after the restart, 3-0 down and the game is lost. \"We really weren't smart enough and showed a certain naivety.\"", "As flames neared the seaside resort of Calampiso, fishermen and boat-owners were drafted in to aid the evacuation. Matteo Rizzo, the mayor of nearby San Vito Lo Capo, appealed for help from \"anyone with safe and reliable boats\". Writing on Facebook, he called the situation at the village west of Palermo \"very urgent\". Evacuees were taken to schools in San Vito, and the mayor urged his \"friendly and generous\" town to pull together. \"We need minibuses and cars to pick people up at the little port and take them to school buildings,\" he said. \"Let's all do something.\" There are no reports of injuries caused by the Calampiso fire, but witnesses described running to the beach as their accommodation burned. Italian paper La Stampa quoted one evacuated tourist, Stella Belliotti, as saying: \"We fled in swimwear and slippers. Our apartment was engulfed in flames. They were right above us. I took my daughter and I went to the beach. They made us go on the boats that go around Zingaro.

Images from the slopes of Mount Vesuvius, in the southern region of Campania, show clouds of smoke over a kilometre high pouring into the air near Naples. The national fire service said it was engaged in 441 operations across Italy on Wednesday, including 288 wildfires. Those at Vesuvius are among the most serious. Around 70 firefighters have tackled the huge fire on the ground, alongside Civil Protection volunteers, and three helicopters have been deployed. Environment Minister Gian Luca Galletti said a man had been arrested on suspicion of arson in the area. \"If someone set fire to Vesuvius, I want to see them in jail for 15 years,\" Italian media quoted him as saying. The minister said a decision would be made shortly about whether to send the army to assist the stricken areas. The World Wildlife Fund has warned that thousands of people, animals, and a nature reserve are at risk around the volcano. Italy's government declared a state of emergency last week in response to the drought in the northern provinces of Parma and Piacenza, and opposition politicians are demanding the same for the wildfires.", "Staff were told on Tuesday that the city centre business had gone into liquidation with the loss of 53 jobs.

The receiver then sold the trading side of the business. \"I'm there from I was 14 and I'm just absolutely devastated,\" Ms McNally told BBC Radio Foyle, \"We laughed everyday, we had great customers, our colleagues were great, our bosses were great. \"Even for the management themselves it was just horrific.\" Toni has two children and believes it will be difficult to adjust to being unemployed. \"I don't have a clue, I've never even been to the unemployment centre. \"The liquidators have set up a clinic for us to go on Friday so we can discuss what we're entitled to and all the rest of it,\" she said. \"We were all like brothers and sisters. I loved everybody that I worked with.\" Another worker, Jackie McCormill, described how she arrived at the store to find the shutters pulled down. \"We pulled the shutter up and stood inside to wait for one of the managers to say that the shop was closed, that the liquidators were in, and that it was all over for us really. \"The other girl I was with was actually physically shaking, it's like someone hit you over the head with a hammer, but this has been coming. \"Everybody was crying, women all red faced.

Terribly illegally.\" Jones says his side have a stronger scrum, adding if the laws are enforced England \"will get an advantage\". Wales forwards coach Robin McBryde highlighted England's Joe Marler is a frequent infringer at the scrum. \"He definitely needs to scrummage legally otherwise we will be pointing our finger,\" said McBryde. Wales, who are one point behind Six Nations leaders England with two games remaining, felt harshly done by at the scrum in their 28-25 win over England in the pool stage of last year's World Cup. And McBryde said loose-head Marler had been \"found out\" when England lost to Australia in their next World Cup game. \"There was a big focus on the loose-heads' angles, particularly with [Wales prop] Gethin Jenkins being highlighted,\" said McBryde. \"So we were very disappointed in that England game to fall on the wrong side of decisions and we felt the problem lay elsewhere.\" However, Jones says he is \"quite upset\" by Wales' approach to the set-piece. \"They play the laws very well,\" the Australian told BBC Radio 5 live. \"They pre-engage all the time, which is against the laws of the game. \"And then they get penalised one or two times at the start of the game, but the referee gets sick of penalising it. \"Because if the referee keeps penalising it, you know what happens? The referee gets criticised. \"We really want to have a scrum contest on Saturday - it's an important part of the game - so we are really hopeful the referee enforces the law in that area.\" Jones added: \"If you are the referee and you keep penalising Wales for pre-engaging, then all the smart guys in the commentators' box say 'this referee is ruining the game'. \"But they are not ruining the game, it's the team that is scrummaging illegally which is ruining the game. \"So we want the referee to be really hard, and if he has to ruin the game, he has to ruin the game.\"", "Maya Kantengule was found at the bottom of a swimming pool at Waveney River Centre holiday park in Burgh St Peter, Norfolk, on May 1 2016.

Maya's father, Livial Kantengule, said in a written statement at the inquest in Norwich that he spoke to Jane Rainer, the mother of his daughter's best friend, as he arrived and decided not to wait at the pool during the party. He returned there with his wife, Glenda, after receiving a message there had been an accident. Maya had already been taken to the hospital near Great Yarmouth. Her parents were at her bedside when she was pronounced dead. Mr Kantengule said he did not ask if there was a lifeguard. \"Jane used to volunteer to help with the swimming lessons, so we assumed Maya would be adequately supervised while in the pool,\" he said.

Analysts say the revision may be enough to mean the overall economy narrowly avoided falling into recession for a second time. The ONS is due to give official confirmation of this in June. The revised figures show the construction sector shrank by 5% in the first three months of 2012, less than the 5.4% contraction initially reported. The ONS gives its final estimates for growth in June, and if other parts of the economy remain unchanged, the economy as a whole would register zero growth, rather than a contraction of 0.1%. The economy needs to register two consecutive quarters of negative growth to be in recession. By Stephanie FlandersEconomics editor However, the ONS may also revise the growth of other parts of the economy when it publishes its final estimates in June, such as the much larger services sector, which may offset the gains in construction. Construction accounts for less than 7% of the UK economy, whereas the services sector makes up about three quarters of output. Despite this, the construction sector's weakness has been blamed for dragging down economic growth. The ONS figures showed that construction output fell again in the first three months of this year, reaching its lowest level in 15 years. It was down 2.4% compared the last quarter of 2012. Output has fallen by nearly a fifth since the height of the construction boom in 2008. The ONS will publish the Quarterly National Accounts on 27 June.", "On board were 200 men and women from the United States intent on building a colony on the Caribbean island. They hoped that if enough of their fellow nationals followed their lead, eventually Cuba would be annexed by the US. Local folklore has it that after days fighting a path through the swamp, the early settlers were so happy to reach somewhere that was not knee-deep in mud or thick with swarms of mosquitoes that they proclaimed it to be \"the glory\". La Gloria City was born. In fact, they had been sold a lie. They had bought plots of land in a town that existed only in the blueprints of the Cuba Land and Steamship Company of New York. Upon realising the deception, many cut their losses and went home. The hardy ones stayed on and became citrus farmers, sugarcane growers and cattle farmers. The sweltering humidity is still the same as in those days. But all that remains of those early 20th Century pioneers today are the gravestones in the local cemetery. They include a store owner called William Stokes, who was just a baby when his parents chose to make the trip to Cuba. He married, raised a family and stayed in the sleepy community for the rest of his life, even after his children left and his business went broke. By the time of his death in 1974, Mr Stokes was the only original US settler still on the island, earning him the title of \"the last North American in Cuba\". \"It's important to me to maintain this place,\" says gravedigger Jorge Gallardo as he leads me to the grave of Willy Stokes, as he calls him. Mr Gallardo has spent a year hacking back the encroaching vegetation from the cemetery. \"This is our eternal home - for me and my children, and for our North American founders,\" he explains. One of La Gloria's oldest residents remembers when it was more of an American than a Cuban town. Now in her late 80s, Jeanny Martinez was fostered by William Stokes' parents and still speaks near-flawless English. \"La Gloria was all American. Beautiful, American houses. The Methodist church was there and the Episcopal one was over there,\" she says pointing from the porch of her small tin-and-timber home. Like many Cubans of her generation, Ms Martinez speaks of her youth before the 1959 revolution with a mixture of romanticism and nostalgia. \"I have to defend the Americans because lots of people were hungry and they gave them work and food in the orange and tangerine groves,\" she says. \"Now La Gloria is not good for anything.\" That is not a view shared by those working at the local farming cooperative named after revolutionary hero Camilo Cienfuegos. Under more relaxed rules on agricultural production in Cuba, the cooperative has begun to grow a wider range of goods on land that previously lay idle. \"Yucca, bananas, avocados, squashes, tomatoes...,\"Elida Diaz lists the things which grow on the land she farms with her family. Ms Diaz disputes the idea that the town has stagnated over the years saying that the region has developed significantly. \"When I arrived here aged 20, there was no electricity, nothing,\" she recalls. \"Today we have public transport, we're on the electrical grid, we have refrigeration units. It's been a complete change.\" But in the field behind her, the men are mostly using the same tools as the settlers did: hoes, machetes, their bare hands. A loyal revolutionary, Ms Diaz is reluctant to voice criticism but admits that more is needed if the remote community is to prosper and move into the 21st Century. A water shortage is causing severe problems throughout Camaguey province and monthly incomes for rural workers are far from stable. \"A new tractor would let us work the land better, new tools, boots for the workers, tractor tyres, spare parts, fuel\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\" she says, warming to her theme. But she is quick to identify Washington and its decades-old trade embargo as the source of the problem. \"The first thing that the Americans must do is lift the embargo on us. Then we could supply them with our citrus and they could send us the products we need. That would be wonderful.\" In 1932 a huge hurricane swept through Camaguey devastating the citrus and sugar crops and destroying the dreams of the thousand or so colonists in La Gloria City. Most sold up and left. Among the wreckage was the town's Protestant church. More than 80 years later, the groundwork for a new one is only now getting underway. Built on the original site with funding from Jacksonville, Florida, churchgoers in La Gloria see it as a fitting legacy to this uniquely American corner of the Cuban countryside.", "Hamilton described the change as \"too drastic\" and the \"worst-looking\" modification in Formula 1 history. John Surtees' son Henry died during a Formula Two race in 2009 after being struck on the head by a stray tyre. \"I suffered the tragedy of losing Henry which certainly could've been prevented by a development like this,\" he said. Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel had said the device can be as \"ugly as possible\" as long as it helps save lives. The German also thinks Henry Surtees would \"still be around if we had this type of system\". John Surtees, who won the 1964 drivers' championship with Ferrari, said: \"Lewis could perhaps think a little more about the 'halo' and think about the responsibility he does have as a world champion. \"Change comes about and sometimes changes are forced upon one.

The Cypriot side grew in confidence and stature in the second half, though, and equalised through Ribeiro Santana. Yet indiscipline cost the visitors, with Esteban Sachetti dismissed before Shinnie's winner. Apollon head coach Sofronis Avgousti had already been sent to the stand, just after the Cypriot side equalised. It may have been a rare home European win for the Dons, but given their excellent away form in the Europa League they will be confident of seeing the job through in Larnaca next Thursday night; and they did it without their main hitman. Only Mark McGhee, John Hewitt and Drew Jarvie have scored more European goals for Aberdeen than Adam Rooney, but he may have to wait until the final qualifying round to add the nine he already has. The Irishman had a scan on a hamstring injury the day before the first leg tie and faces a race to be fit not just for the second leg in Cyprus but also the Premiership opener at home to Hamilton on Sunday week. Early on, it didn't look as if the loss of their most prolific striker in recent years would matter that much. Aberdeen started impressively, with a performance of pace, intensity and pressing that Apollon found hard to resist. They were also boosted by an early goal, with Celtic's on-loan midfielder Christie once again the man that mattered after scoring in the home leg against Siroki Brijeg before creating both in the away win in the last round. This time, the midfielder linked up effectively with former Celtic winger Gary Mackay-Steven, looping in a header from the latter's inviting cross from the left. Greg Stewart came in for some heavy treatment from Sachetti and the Argentinian midfielder was lucky to escape with only a yellow card for a shocking challenge on the former Dundee striker. However, to their credit the Cypriot side somehow survived the Dons early onslaught and started to play their way into the game with some neat passing movement that only lacked a cutting edge. It was unsurprising that Christie came closest to increasing Aberdeen's lead before the break with another lovely bit of skill at the edge of penalty area, only to see his shot fly just wide. Like the home leg against Siroki Brijeg, though, Aberdeen looked second best for long spells after the break, with substitute Antonio Jakolis causing problems down the right wing, so much so that he created an equaliser. The Croatian burst clear before pulling the ball back for Brazillian left back Jander to force an effort over the line from close range. It looked ominous for Aberdeen at that stage but Avgousti was sent to the stand before the restart and worse was to follow when Sachetti picked up a second yellow card after flattening Christie with 19 minutes remaining. The captain Shinnie rose to the occasion, with a stunning strike right out of the blue from 20 yards that arched its way into the top right-hand corner of the net.", "The Marine Conservation Society said more than 8,000 bottles were picked up during its Great British Beach Clean Up in September, up 43% on 2014.

In Wrexham, homes and streets were hit in Llay, Rossett and Gresford. Residents in at least four properties on Llay New Road are being rehoused while repairs are carried out. Brother and sister Peter and Mandy Jones spent Monday surveying the damage at their father's home. He is being rehoused for the next several months until repair work is completed. They described the situation as \"distressing\" saying cars passing through Sunday's floodwater sent waves of water into their father's home on Llay New Road. Wrexham council said it was assisting tenants at five council houses in Llay and two in Rossett and knew of other private homes affected by the floods. In Pembrokeshire residents described an \"ocean of water\" after a river burst its banks near homes in Narberth. And in Whitland, Carmarthenshire, five people were rescued by boat after their car was submerged in flood water.", "Programme makers did not disclose the comments made by Biggins, who had been the bookmakers' favourite to win. But they said the Channel 5 show \"does not tolerate offensive language\". Biggins, 67, had sparked controversy four days earlier over comments that bisexual people were \"the worst type\". Opening Friday's live show - which saw presenter Anthea Turner's ex-husband Grant Bovey voted out of the house - presenter Emma Willis made brief reference to Biggins' removal but gave no details. A statement posted on the Celebrity Big Brother website said the show had \"taken the decision to remove Christopher Biggins\". \"Since entering Big Brother, he has made a number of comments capable of causing great offence to housemates and the viewing public,\" it said. \"Big Brother does not tolerate offensive language capable of causing widespread offence.\" During a conversation about homosexuality earlier this week, the openly gay star said: \"The worst type though is, I'm afraid to say, the bisexuals... what it is is people not wanting to admit they are gay.\" He was then seen agreeing with fellow contestant Renee Graziano's comment that \"You have to pick a team\". The programme's producers have not said whether these comments were among those that they considered before ordering Biggins to leave the house. Two of the other housemates have received official warnings from Big Brother over their behaviour in the show's first week. US singer Aubrey O'Day was warned for spitting in reality TV star Stephen Bear's sandwich. Bear himself received a warning after throwing a mug, which smashed a glass window, following a row with Heavy D from the TV show Storage Hunters. Biggins won ITV show I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! in 2007. The other contestants on this year's Celebrity Big Brother are: Renee Graziano of TV's Mob Wives; former X Factor contestants Chloe Khan and Katie Waissel; US actor Frankie Grande; reality TV stars Lewis Bloor and Marnie Simpson, former EastEnders actor Ricky Norwood; Loose Women presenter Saira Khan, and former model Samantha Fox.", "The firm said that it was working to boost capacity at telephone exchanges in the worst hit areas. The news coincided with the launch of Sky Go Extra - a service allowing users to download movies and TV shows so they can be watched offline. One expert said the product might add to the strain. Sky Go Extra still works at slow internet speeds - however, Sky's other streaming services rely on the user having a 2 megabit per second connection. Some subscribers have complained their download speeds have fallen below this level at peak times. A Sky spokeswoman apologised for the problems. \"Following a combination of an underlying increase in network traffic as well as a high rate of new customer additions, we are aware of capacity issues in a small number of exchanges,\" she said. \"We are working on adding new capacity to those exchanges as quickly as we can. We apologise to all customers who have been impacted by this issue.\" She confirmed a report by The Register that users in Doncaster, North Wales and Bristol were among those affected, but declined to be more specific or name other locations. However, the firm has provided an online postcode checking facility for its subscribers to check if their local exchange has been flagged as having an issue. Sky also indicated that less than 5% of its broadband customer base used the affected exchanges. Andrew Ferguson, editor of the Thinkbroadband news site noted that Sky had recently run a major promotion highlighting the fact it did not place \"fair use\" caps on the amount of data its customers use. As a result, he said, the firm had probably attracted subscribers who downloaded significantly more than the average 23 gigabytes per month consumed by the average UK broadband user. \"Sky had this problem last year in some of its exchanges, and it's definitely not the only service provider to have experienced this problem,\" he told the BBC. \"It's very much related to the firms' promotional activities. Sky has also been pushing its fibre products recently - they offer higher speeds and people who sign up generally use more data afterwards.\"", "Koukash has owned the Super League team since 2013 but it has stated before he could leave Salford. \"My plans are to make sure we win the next few games. We'll see what happens at the end of the season,\" he said. \"I have not made my mind up to walk away, I'm working hard to make sure it is financially viable for next year.\" Salford scored 13 tries as they comfortably beat Featherstone on Sunday in a game where only 1,759 were in attendance at the AJ Bell Stadium. \"It was a crucial game, there was no football around, there was good weather, it's a Sunday where families can come and we reduced ticket prices,\" Koukash told BBC Radio Manchester. \"To only have 1,750 for a crucial game, I must say I'm very disappointed. What the fans all have to understand is that next year the club will only be able to spend what it can afford. \"I can no longer keep bankrolling it the way I did. If the fans wanted to see a competitive Super League side they need to start turning up.\" Despite his future with the club being in doubt, Koukash said he could not buy another rugby league club if his time with Salford was to end. \"Once you are a Red Devil, you will always be a Red Devil. I will never be involved with another club, that's it. The time when I finish from Salford, I will just sit back and enjoy the sport like any other fan,\" he added.", "Tom Queally, 30, from Oak Lodge, Newmarket in Suffolk was found asleep in his car in Cheshire in March. He admitted the charge and received the ban and a \u00a31,350 fine at Crewe Magistrates' Court. But his lawyer, Nick Freeman, argued he had been forced to plead guilty because the law did not recognise the sleep walking argument. The prosecution said Queally, famous for being the regular jockey of \"wonder horse\" Frankel, was found asleep at the wheel of his BMW at a filling station in Chelford, Cheshire,with the engine running and the lights on at 05:40 GMT on 16 March. A breath test showed a reading of 84 microgrammes of alcohol in 100ml of blood, when the legal limit is 35 microgrammes. His defence argued that Queally, who is originally from Dungarvan in the Irish Republic, had been a sleep walker since he was five years old. He had been out in Hale, Cheshire, and his last recollection was reading a magazine on a bed at his manager's house at 02:00 GMT. Mr Freeman said: \"The thrust of my mitigation is he's completely unaware of what he's doing - he's sleep driving. \"I don't think the law has kept up with scientific developments, because it seems simply unfair for a man of this quality now to have a criminal conviction for something which in my view, he's morally totally innocent.\" District Judge Bridget Knight said the law had previously ruled that sleep walking was not a defence for drink driving. Queally was also fined \u00a31,350 and ordered to pay costs of \u00a33,500. Speaking afterwards, Mr Freeman said: \"The law needs to be changed to reflect this unique set of circumstances.\"", "They were part of the cargo on the SS Politician, which sank off Eriskay in the Outer Hebrides in 1941. Scotch Whisky Auctions, which sold the bottles, said they had gone to a buyer in the UK after worldwide interest. They were among eight bottles recovered from the wreck in 1987 by Donald MacPhee, from South Uist. The whisky is not thought to be fit for human consumption. The SS Politician was headed for Jamaica with 28,000 cases of whisky when it ran aground on the northern side of Eriskay in bad weather. Islanders recovered hundreds of cases of whisky from the wreck and some of the bottles were buried to keep them hidden from customs officers. Other bottles have since been found washed up on the island's shores and also recovered by divers. Scottish author Compton Mackenzie, published the novel Whisky Galore in 1947, which was loosely based on the SS Politician wreck. It was adapted for the cinema in a 1949 Ealing comedy starring Basil Radford.", "Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, 25, pleaded guilty to attempting to blow up a commercial plane as a would-be suicide mission for al-Qaeda. His family quickly called on the US government to review the sentence. Abdulmutallab was badly burned when a bomb sewn into his underwear failed to detonate fully, prosecutors said. Almost 300 people were on the flight from Amsterdam to Detroit. Some of the passengers from the flight were in the courtroom as Federal Judge Nancy Edmunds announced the sentence. Profile: Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab \"This was an act of terrorism that cannot be quibbled with,\" Judge Edmunds said, as she imposed the maximum sentence. The son of a Nigerian banker and a former engineering student at University College London, Abdulmutallab faced eight counts against him, including terrorism and attempted murder. Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), a militant group based in Yemen, said it was behind the attempted attack. In statement to the BBC, the family of Abdulmutallab said they were \"grateful to God that the unfortunate incident of that date did not result in any injury or death\". \"We strongly appeal to the American justice department to review the life sentence,\" they said. \"We also appeal to the Federal Republic of Nigeria to continue with their support and engage with the American government to ensure that a review is made.\" Ahead of the sentencing, assistant defence lawyer Anthony Chambers argued that a life sentence for Abdulmutallab would be unconstitutional, since no other passengers were hurt. By Mark LobelBBC News, Lagos Many more young Nigerians have been radicalised since Lagos-born Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab's actions linked the West African country to al-Qaeda. But the organisation behind their radicalisation is Boko Haram, a local religious group that has turned militant. It wants Nigeria ruled by strict Islamic law and its recruits take quite different journeys from that of the man in his twenties from a very wealthy northern Nigerian family, now in the hands of the US penal system. A neighbour of the Abdulmutallab family in Kaduna, prominent rights activist Shehu Sani, told me a lighter sentence would give Umar Farouk a deserved chance to rehabilitate. The blame should lie with the terrorists who took advantage of the model student, as he was too young to know better, he said. Some in the Muslim north think the whole case is a US conspiracy. There is far less sympathy for him in the Christian south. Matthew, a banker, said that a death sentence would be justified. Having harmed Nigeria's image, as Boko Haram is doing now, Matthew said the 25-year-old does not deserve a second chance. Sentencing guidelines directed the judge to impose a mandatory life sentence, but Mr Chambers appealed for a lighter term. \"Not one passenger lost his or her life. Not one passenger suffered life-threatening injuries,\" he said. Prosecutors said a life sentence was warranted because an attempted terror attack heightens public fear and burdens airports with expensive and time-consuming security procedures. As part of the sentencing hearing, four passengers and a crew member aboard Flight 253 made statements, telling the judge the event had forever changed their lives. A video from the FBI showing the power of the explosive material found in Abdulmutallab's underwear was also shown at the hearing. As the video played Abdulmutallab twice said loudly \"Allahu akbar\" - Arabic for \"God is great\". Abdulmutallab himself made a brief statement. During the short trial, he had fired his lawyer and attempted to represent himself. \"Mujahideen are proud to kill in the name of God,\" he said in court. \"And that is exactly what God told us to do in the Koran... Today is a day of victory.\" \"In quick response to some of the things that have been said, I say my life and the lives of Muslims have also changed due to the attacks on innocent civilians,\" he added. On the second day of his trial, in October, Abdulmutallab unexpectedly declared that he would plead guilty to all charges. The bomb was a \"blessed weapon to save the lives of innocent Muslims\", he told the court. \"The US should be warned that if they continue to kill and support those who kill innocent Muslims, then the US should await a great calamity... or God will strike them directly,\" he added. Investigators said Abdulmutallab admitted he was working for AQAP, and had been inspired by and had met Anwar al-Awlaki, a radical cleric who was killed in 2011 by a US drone strike in Yemen. Abdulmutallab received the bomb, as well as training, from AQAP before travelling from Nigeria to Amsterdam. There he boarded Northwest Airlines Flight 253 to Detroit, which was carrying 279 passengers and 11 crew members. The bomb was not picked up in security checks at airports in Lagos and Amsterdam. On board, the bomb failed to detonate completely and passengers had to put out the fire. Abdulmutallab's father, Alhaji Umaru Mutallab, an influential banker who is well connected in Nigerian politics, said he had approached the US embassy officials and Nigerian authorities in 2009 to warn them about his son. Abdulmutallab was already on a US watch list, but not a no-fly list.", "The star will play Mrs Potts, the housekeeper magically transformed into a teapot whom Dame Angela Lansbury voiced in the 1991 animated version of the film.

Forty-eight hours earlier, Robson had won her first tournament since the age of 14 - capturing the ITF title in Landisville, Pennsylvania. It was by far and away her biggest triumph since first feeling the effects of a wrist injury in the late summer of 2013. She played only two events in the whole of 2014, and in April of that year underwent surgery on her dominant left wrist in Minnesota. Her recovery was a slow, painful and very frustrating process. She next played competitively at the Eastbourne qualifying event of June 2015. By this time Robson had forfeited her WTA ranking. She was playing on a 12 month long protected ranking of 58 (the position she held at her last event before injury: the 2014 Australian Open) and the comeback was a very stilted affair. Other minor injuries held her back as she hit the practice courts hard and it is only since the start of this year that she has been totally free of pain in the wrist. Robson's progress in the first six months of this year was unspectacular. At the back of your mind you're not quite sure if your body is going to break down or if it's properly healed She has won only one tour level match since her return - and that came against an unranked Moroccan teenager in the first round of the WTA event in Rabat; she was soundly beaten by Andrea Petkovic at the French Open, and Angelique Kerber at Wimbledon. But then, after dispiriting trips to minor tournaments in Fort Worth, Lexington and Sacramento in which she collected five ranking points and earned barely one thousand dollars, Robson won five matches in a row in Landisville - including the final without dropping a game. The $3,919 in prize money was irrelevant, but the 50 ranking points helped her climb back into the world's top 250, and did wonders for her confidence. \"I definitely put a lot of pressure on myself when I had my protected ranking,\" Robson told BBC Sport after qualifying for the main draw at the US Open. \"You know you are on a limited amount of time so I wasn't playing as freely as maybe I should have - especially at the Slams. \"But I knew I was putting in all the right things on the practice court and in the gym. It was waiting for that one moment where it all came together. I was prepared for it - I knew that I had this long season of training behind me.\" Her reward for overcoming a nasty bout of conjunctivitis to win three qualifying matches at Flushing Meadows is a first round match on Tuesday with fellow British player Naomi Broady. Robson is now being coached by the former British number one Lucie Ahl and Colin Beecher, and being watched here in New York by the LTA's lead women's coach Jeremy Bates. \"You see it a lot with athletes when they've had a long term injury,\" Bates explained, after Robson's early Saturday morning practice session. \"Mentally it's very difficult to fully commit yourself again to the physicality of the sport. At the back of your mind you're not quite sure if your body is going to break down or if it's properly healed. \"You can't shortcut it. At Wimbledon she was playing, but now when you see her play she's completely uninhibited, she's very mobile, she's chasing every ball. She's able to recover and compete as she used to. And you can see that she has no negative thoughts in her mind at all. \"It's completely mental - you've just got to get your brain around it.\" Media playback is not supported on this device Robson has lost virtually three years of her career - but yet she is only 22, and is still armed with a devastating forehand. She says she is working harder than ever on the practice court, and has proved in the past she has the temperament for the big occasion. In the first eight months of 2013 alone, Robson beat Petra Kvitova en route to the third round of the Australian Open; had clay court wins over Agnieszka Radwanska and Venus Williams; reached the fourth round of Wimbledon and then the third round of the US Open. As a result, she reached a career high ranking of 27. Her involvement in the final Grand Slam of this year has, though, come as a lovely surprise. After winning in Landisville, Robson's agent Max Eisenbud told her there was virtually no chance of her being awarded a wildcard into qualifying. Hence the flight back home to the UK, and then on to Italy for that girls' holiday. Find out how to get into tennis in our special guide. She was soon gone. But not forgotten. \"I've had so many pictures of their sunset cruises and they have been tagging me in their Instagram as if I'm still part of the group,\" Robson said. \"We had squad necklaces and everything - it was a full on girls' trip. \"But they're very happy that I came here instead.\"", "The 23-year-old needed 6,200 points for Olympic qualification and achieved it with ease in Austria. World silver medallist Brianne Theisen-Eaton defended her title, setting a world-leading 6,765-points total. Latvia's Laura Ikauniece-Admidina was second, with Germany's Carolin Schafer third. Johnson-Thompson, the 2014 champion, was second overall after setting three personal bests on a promising opening day, but fell behind on day two after failing to shine in the long jump and javelin. The Liverpudlian recorded two legal jumps in the long jump, the furthest of which was 6.17m - the sixth best of the field and some distance below her lifetime best of 6.92m. But while her performance in one of her favoured events diminished her chances of challenging reigning champion Theisen-Eaton for the title, it was enough to keep her on course for Olympic qualification - and a step towards eradicating the demons of last year's World Championships in Beijing. It was the long jump, her disastrous three fouls, which ruined her chances of winning a medal last summer and the Briton had admitted she would be nervous on the runway in Austria. When asked whether she was worried about the long jump in Rio, she replied: \"Yeah, I'm not going to lie, there will be but I know I can get through it. It's just about getting my confidence back. \"I know that I have a big jump in me. The shot put is definitely a bigger concern for me.\" This was her first major competition after undergoing a knee operation last autumn and she had repeatedly stated her main aim was to obtain the points needed for Rio, where she is expected to vie for gold with reigning Olympic champion Jessica Ennis-Hill and Theisen-Eaton. Needing 35m or more to keep her on course for Rio, Johnson-Thompson threw 36.66m in the javelin - the second worst in the field - which left her requiring a time of 2:24.50 or better in the 800m. With a personal best over two laps of 2:07.64 there was little to worry about, although the strapping on her left leg perhaps explained why she took it easy in the race, clocking 2:16.81 for the 11th quickest time overall. \"I didn't want to push and injure myself so I just took it as an easy day. The feeling is one of relief more than anything else,\" she said. \"My goal is definitely a gold medal still in Rio. I've got a lot to work on between now and then but this is my first time back after surgery, so I know exactly what I need to work on.\" British teenager Morgan Lake withdrew from the competition after a disappointing opening day in Austria which left her 29th overall and unlikely to achieve the total needed for Rio. Her coach and father, Eldon Lake, revealed the 19-year-old had been suffering with an adductor injury, missing a number of weeks of training leading up to the competition. \"It was always a gamble trying to compete while managing an injury and, on this occasion, it didn't pay off,\" he told BBC Sport. Lake, who will have other opportunities to qualify for Rio, said on Twitter: \"Disappointed doesn't come close to how I feel right now, but it has made me even more determined to get the qualifying score and fight for my place in Rio.\" The 6,200-points total is more than was needed for London 2012, while attaining that mark would require Lake to break her personal best of 6,148, set in Eugene in 2014 when she became world junior champion. In the decathlon, Britain's Ashley Bryant fell 44 points short of the Olympic qualifying standard of 8100. The 25-year-old, who had to borrow vaulting poles after Swiss Air had lost them, could only clear 4.40m - 30cm below his personal best. Compatriot John Lane, competing for the first time since injury, withdrew after the first day as his poles also failed to arrive. He tweeted: \"Some things are manageable... trying to pole vault in Austria when your poles are in Birmingham is not. Cheers @FlySWISS.\"", "He was elected with 571 votes, ahead of Michael Henderson and David Noakes with 184 and 109 votes respectively. A total of 883 (27%) of the 3,220 registered voters turned out with four blank papers and 15 spoilt papers. Mr Parkinson will serve for four months and said there were \"very important decisions\" to be made in that time. Before the by-election some criticism was made of the \u00c2\u00a350,000 cost, a fifth of a general election, for the short term of the office - the by-election had to be held under the island's Reform Law. Mr Parkinson said: \"The voters of St Peter Port North deserve to be represented every bit as strongly as the voters of any other district. \"These next four months will set the scene for the general election, it will help to define the issues on which the general election will be fought.\" Mr Parkinson served in the States from 2004-2012 and was the minister of Treasury of Resources from 2008-2012. He previously stood in the South East district and said he had \"enjoyed biking around getting to know the St Peter Port North district better\" while campaigning. He campaigned with three key policies; diversifying the economy, reforming the corporate tax system and solving the affordable housing crisis. His term of office will end at the general election on 27 April. The by-election was called after the death of Deputy Martin Storey in July.", "This afternoon, the Labour leader returned to the stage - in shirt sleeves this time - to face questions from his audience. One introduced herself: \"Christina Rees, newly-elected Labour councillor for Bridgend.\" So far so good. But then it got trickier. \"And you haven't kissed me, Ed, but you kissed Barbara yesterday and I'm extremely jealous,\" joked Christina. A look of mock alarm came over the leader's face as he assured delegates: \"Don't get the wrong idea by the way.\" Christina told her leader how Labour had won a by-election in Bettws: \"The Tories only got 12 votes!\" Ed Miliband started to look concerned: \"Don't give us all the Bridgend results because we might be here.....\" He cut swiftly to his next questioner - Barbara Jones, from Caerphilly, who introduced herself thus: \"I am the lucky one that got the kiss yesterday and I've had so many texts you wouldn't believe it.\" Had he not been wearing television make-up, Ed Miliband surely would have blushed. Instead, he briefly referred to delegates as \"comrades\" for the first time, while imploring Barbara to move on. Barbara moved on, but 24 hours into the era of \"one nation Labour\" the leader has discovered that you can't please all the people all the time.", "The 34-year-old has recently returned from a spell with Atletico Kolkata, where he won the Indian Super League. \"Everyone knows the affiliation I have with the club,\" said Pearson. \"I thoroughly enjoyed my time here. \"It is a good place to come and work so it ticked all the boxes for me and hopefully it suits Motherwell in the short term.\" Pearson returns to Scotland with an Indian Super League winner's medal and plenty of fond memories. \"It was very good. I went out and did pre-season in Madrid for a month and then we flew for the season beginning in October and finished the season off just before Christmas,\" he said. \"We managed to win the league, which was great. \"So it made up for the big decision to go out there in the first place, it kind of justified that by coming back with a winner's medal.\" The Indian Super League has only been around for a few years, with the short season and long distance travel notable elements of the experience for Pearson. \"This will only be the fourth year [of the Indian Super League] coming up now, so it is still in the early stages. It is a good competition, only over a short period of time, so the games are thick and fast with lots of travelling - that is one of the things I found quite difficult, the travelling side of it. \"But I could not speak highly enough of the league. Everybody out there is superb. They try to be as professional as possible. They have got a lot of experience and big names out there and they are trying to build up grass-roots level and start from the bottom.\" Pearson also believes the lure of lucrative contracts in India will encourage other players to try their luck over in the sub-continent. He said: \"It is certainly a place you will see a lot of players trying to get to. There is a lot of money there, especially for the foreign players who come in. You're allowed 15 foreign players, and 15 local players. But you can only have five foreign players in the starting team at one time - I think they might be reducing that to encourage the progression of the Indian lads.\" However, Pearson says Indian football still cannot compete with the money being splashed by clubs in China. \"I think the money that is getting thrown around in China is just on another level at the minute,\" he said. \"In India they do try to pay the foreign players well because it is only a short time that they are out there and they want to get the best players to come and help the Indian players develop. \"They are passionate about it and everything they do, they give it their all.\" In terms of his ambitions with Motherwell for the rest of the Premiership season, Pearson added: \"I am just looking forward to helping the team out, contribute as much as I can between now and the end of the season and help this club finish as high up the league as possible.\"", "Support workers believe that a report on children abused in the town between 1997 and 2013 may have under-estimated the number because it was unlikely to include the experiences of Asian girls. The Jay report, published in August, put the figure at at least 1,400. But Yasmin Ishaq, who has supported victims, said: \"It's not just the young white girls that they're targeting.\" Ms Ishaq, who runs a voluntary organisation,  said men who they knew to be abusers had never been prosecuted and were also systematically abusing young girls within their own network of family and friends. She told BBC File on 4: \"The Pakistani girls are not going to be part and parcel of this report. There's no record of what's happened to them. They're too afraid to have ever gone to the law. \"The men will get away with this because nobody wants to address it and nobody wants to own up to the fact that their daughter has been molested.\" Although none of the victims would talk directly to the BBC, File on 4 heard reports of some Asian girls being blackmailed by grooming rings, while others were forced at knifepoint to perform sexual acts on men. Ms Ishaq described how one teenage girl she had been helping was taken to what she thought was a party by her boyfriend. \"When she got there, there was no party, there were no other female members present. What she found was that there were five adults, their ages ranging between their mid 20s going on to the late 40s and five men systematically, routinely, raped her. And the young man who was supposed to be her boyfriend, stood back and watched.\" Ms Ishaq explained that the group photographed the abuse and threatened to publish it unless she did as she was told. \"This is what is being said to her now: that if you do not comply, we will be submitting these photographs not only to your parents, to your fathers, to your brothers, but we will actually be posting them to local mosques,\" she said. \"She is still currently in this hell-hole. She cannot see how by going to the police or asking for their help, she can save herself from the consequences of what her family will do to her. She has a genuine fear that she will be beaten, she will be taken abroad, she will be forced into a marriage she doesn't want to be in.\" Listen to File on 4: The Last Taboo on 28 October at 20.00 GMT or later  on iPlayer. Other organisations told the BBC they had heard similar stories of abuse in the town. \"There's a particular woman with learning difficulties that we're supporting and she will show you pictures on her phone of about six to eight different Pakistani men. She's adamant they're all her boyfriends,\" said Zlakha Ahmed, head of Apna Haq, a group that supports women from ethnic minorities in Rotherham. \"She talks about the chocolates, the phones, the clothes, the presents, that they buy for her. They regularly pay for her train fare so she can go down to Manchester, Blackburn, London, Birmingham. \"When she arrives she'll go to a really posh hotel, she meets a number of these men and she's introduced to some of their friends. Then she'll always say, 'I was given a drink and I don't remember what happened then'. \"She talks about how she wakes up in the morning and her legs hurt badly, and she's had a number of abortions. For us, that is gang-related abuse of a vulnerable woman. We know this is one young woman. How many others will they be abusing?\" There are no official figures for the number of cases of sexual abuse and grooming within the Asian community, and the Crown Prosecution Service does not record the ethnicities of the women in the cases that come to them. But because of the culture of honour and shame protecting these cases, only a very small proportion are even reported to the authorities.

A Rochdale Council spokeswoman said the crossing is believed to have been built in about 1324 when Edward II ruled England. It expanded as the town grew, with sections added in the Restoration and Georgian eras. Merchants travelled over the bridge to Yorkshire to buy wool which was then finished in Rochdale's mills. In the 1700s it was one of two main routes from Lancashire to Yorkshire, making Rochdale one of the most important towns in the region ahead of the Industrial Revolution. The council said the re-exposed section of the river would help prevent flooding.", "The technology is being trialled at New York Red Bulls' stadium, with a video assistant referee taking 30 seconds to review a challenge in a Red Bulls II match against Orlando City. A screen at the side of the pitch helped the officials decide to dismiss Orlando's Conor Donovan for denying a goalscoring opportunity just outside the penalty area. Video replays will be used to advise on \"game-changing\" decisions in United Soccer League matches - the third tier of US football. That includes goals, red cards, mistaken identities and penalties. They will also be tested in six other countries in the next two years, including Germany and Italy. The game's lawmakers, the International Football Association Board (IFAB), wants to decide by 2019 on whether to introduce video replays across the sport.", "20 May 2016 Last updated at 12:40 BST They adopted him and he came into the studio for a live interview with his owner who has written a book about it.

Under the deal, the firms will provide an initial $681m in compensation. The collapse of the dam, containing waste from an iron ore mine, killed 19 people and created a river of millions of tonnes of toxic waste. It killed 19 people and is Brazil's worst ever mine disaster. The agreement, between the companies and prosecutors, will see experts appointed to advise the federal prosecutors on the impacts of the dam disaster and any changes that might be needed to social and environmental remediation programs agreed last May. It does not cover the potential size of the final liabilities to be agreed by the end of June. BHP spokesman, Paul Hitchins, said the settlement simplified matters: \"This spells out how and when we are going to settle this with the prosecutors. \"Up until this time we had all these different courts hearing the case. This consolidates all that.\" The companies said they still had not agreed how and when the mine would be able to re-open. They said any restart was subject to separate negotiations and would only happen once it was safe to do so and economically viable. It also needed the support of the devastated local community.", "Processed meat has been modified to either extend its shelf life or change the taste and the main methods are smoking, curing, or adding salt or preservatives. Simply putting beef through a mincer does not mean the resulting mince is \"processed\" unless it is modified further. Processed meat includes bacon, sausages, hot dogs, salami, corned beef, beef jerky and ham as well as canned meat and meat-based sauces. Red meat is a darker colour than white meat and includes beef, lamb and pork because of higher levels of proteins that bind to oxygen, haemoglobin and myoglobin in blood and muscle. Suspected carcinogenic chemicals can form during meat processing. These include N-nitroso compounds and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Cooking the meat at high temperatures, especially on a barbecue, can also produce these dangerous chemicals. However, the WHO's experts admit that the cancer risk is \"not yet fully understood\". Each 50g of processed meat per day - fewer than two slices of bacon - increased the risk of cancer by 18%. Each 100g of red meat per day increased the risk by 17%, although the WHO admits there is limited evidence. The WHO classifies agents into one of five groups: Processed meat has been placed into Group 1 as the scientific evidence says it definitely does cause cancer. Although this does not mean all Group 1 agents - which include tobacco, plutonium and alcohol - are equally dangerous. Red meat is in Group 2A, however, because the WHO says there is insufficient evidence to give a definitive ruling. No. Estimates suggest 34,000 deaths from cancer every year could be down to diets high in processed meat. That is in contrast to one million deaths from cancer caused by smoking and 600,000 attributed to alcohol each year. The WHO says there is insufficient evidence to set safe levels. The World Cancer Research Fund charity argues for \"as little as possible\" processed meat and 500g of cooked red meat (or the equivalent of 700g raw) per week. An eight ounce steak is 225g. In the UK, official advice is for no more than 70 grams a day of red or processed meat so a couple of slices of bacon. Meat is still a good source of protein, B vitamins and minerals such as iron and zinc. Frankie Phillips, spokesperson for the British Dietetic Association, says: \"The message is to still include red meat in the diet because it is a good source of key nutrients. \"The general message is it's OK to eat some red meat but perhaps to look at ways of increasing the amount of plant-based foods - in particular, pulses.\" Frankie Phillips says this can be done in a number of ways, including:", "The EU is expected to renew sanctions in a matter of weeks. Alexis Tsipras was speaking at a joint news conference in Athens with the Russian President Vladimir Putin. Mr Putin said there would be \"no discussions\" about Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula that was seized by Kremlin-backed forces in 2014, leading to sanctions from the EU and US. The territory, which has an ethnic Russian majority, later voted to join Russia in a referendum that Ukraine and Western countries deem illegal. How Russia's relationship with Europe has evolved Mr Tsipras told reporters: \"We have repeatedly said that the vicious circle of militarisation, of Cold War rhetoric and of sanctions is not productive. The solution is dialogue.\" Mr Putin said: \"As far as Crimea is concerned, we consider this question is closed forever. Russia will not conduct any discussions with anyone on this subject.\" Mr Putin's visit to Greece is an attempt to reinforce a relationship with one of Russia's friends in Europe at a time when diplomatic tensions continue between Russia and the EU and US, the BBC's Thomas Fessy in Athens says. Mr Putin also said that Russia would be forced to respond to US moves in Europe, warning that Washington's missile shield bases in Romania and Poland were a direct threat to his country's security. \"If yesterday in those areas of Romania people simply did not know what it means to be in the cross-hairs, then today we will be forced to carry out certain measures to ensure our security.\" Earlier this month, the US activated the anti-missile base in southern Romania. The base in Poland is expected to be operational in 2018. The US says its shield is to protect Nato countries from short- and medium-range missiles, particularly from the Middle East.", "A total of 1,400 tickets have sold out for the opening weekend at Bramall Hall in Stockport, Greater Manchester after renovation work began in 2014. Stained glass windows and ceilings have been restored, while the public will be able to visit the dining room and butler's pantry for the first time. Councillor Kate Butler, from Stockport Council, called it the \"jewel in the crown\" of the town's heritage. The manor dates back to the reign of William the Conqueror when he bestowed the lands upon one of his followers, Hamon de Masci, who became the first Baron of Dunham Massey. Since then the estate has been under the ownership of just three families: the Davenports, De Bromales and Nevills. In 1936, the timber-framed hall and its surrounding parkland was handed over to the local council.

But Amnesty said  progress to end exploitation had been minimal. Among others, the report highlighted that Qatar was \"lagging behind\" in reforming controversial laws that tie migrants to a single employer. Amnesty said that requirements that workers obtain exit permits from their employers in order to leave the country were also still in place. Sherif Elsayed-Ali, Head of Refugee and Migrants' Rights at AI, said: \"Time is running out fast. It has been four years since Qatar won the bid to host the World Cup, putting itself in the global spotlight, so far its response to migrant labour abuses has not been much more than promises of action and draft laws.\" \"Urgent action is needed to ensure we do not end up with a World Cup tournament that is built on forced labour and exploitation.\" The Gulf state has seen an influx of foreign workers ahead of the football tournament and expatriates now make up the bulk of the workforce in the country. Earlier in November, Qatar's Sports Minister Salah bin Ghanem bin Nasser al-Ali told The Associated Press news agency that the country planned to implement labour reforms in the \"next few months\". Amnesty says the proposals do not go far enough. The report said that Qatari officials increasingly acknowledge the need for improvement but that widespread changes must happen in the coming months. A failure to put serious changes in place would \"call into question whether the Qatari authorities are serious about reform,\" said AI. More than 180 migrant workers died in Qatar last year and a significant number are believed to have suffered injuries as a result of unsafe working practices. Qatar is reported to be spending more than $200bn (\u00c2\u00a3121bn) on a series of infrastructure projects, and says the World Cup is a catalyst for a nationwide building project.", "The Republic of Ireland currently has strict abortion laws, which only allow a pregnancy to be terminated if there is a serious risk to a woman's life. The Citizens' Assembly voted 64% to 36% in favour of having no restrictions. Anti-abortion groups have condemned the result of the vote, but any change to the law would require a referendum. The Citizens' Assembly was set up by the Oireachtas (Irish Houses of Parliament) to advise elected representatives on a number of ethical and political dilemmas facing the Irish people. These include abortion, climate change and how the Republic of Ireland deals with the challenge of providing for its aging population. The body is made up of 99 members who were chosen at random to broadly represent the views of the Irish electorate. Its most controversial task was to consider a campaign to repeal the Eighth Amendment of the Irish Constitution - which gives an equal right to life to a pregnant woman and an unborn child. Assembly members held 10 days of intensive and emotive debates over the past five months, culminating in this weekend's series of votes. On Saturday, members voted against repealing the Eighth Amendment, but they did support change - voting to amend or replace the law. On Sunday, a majority of Citizens' Assembly members approved 13 separate grounds for legal terminations in the Republic of Ireland. Of the votes cast, 89% were in favour of allowing abortion on grounds of rape or fatal foetal abnormality - when doctors believe an unborn child is likely to die before, during or shortly after birth. There was less support for legal terminations for \"socio-economic reasons\" but still, 72% of members who took part voted in favour of abortion in those circumstances. However, anti-abortion campaigners dismissed the results of the ballots as a \"muddled and confused farce\". Cora Sherlock of the Pro Life Campaign accused the assembly of having a \"chaotic\" and \"one-sided approach\" in how it conducted its business from the beginning. She added: \"There is nothing liberal or progressive about the assembly recommending a referendum to strip unborn babies of their right to life in law and also ignoring the negative consequences of abortion for women.\" The Citizens' Assembly is chaired by the Supreme Court judge, Ms Justice Mary Laffoy, who will now present a report on members' recommendations to the Oireachtas by late June. In a statement, the chair said members had \"reached a conclusion of sorts\" and she thanked them for having \"engaged with some of the most complex pieces of legislation, immersed themselves in medical and ethical discourse, and listened with respect to the voices and opinions of others\". \"I also wish to acknowledge those whose perspectives or opinions did not emerge in the final vote,\" the judge added. \"This is an exercise in deliberative democracy and their vote remains important to me because of the very fact it captures that other perspective, that dissenting voice, the different interpretation and I wish to assure them that their votes and voices will be recorded and have a place in the report.\" On receipt of her report, elected representatives will consider members' calls for a change in the law, and whether or not to hold a referendum.", "Matt Groening told Smithsonian magazine  he based the town on Springfield, Oregon, but since it is such a common US place name he knew many would think it was their own Springfield. The Springfield question is one of the best-kept secrets in TV history. The Simpsons is the longest-running animation on US TV, on air since 1989. Characters in the show have often joked about hiding Springfield's real location. \"In anticipation of the success of the show, I thought: 'This will be cool, everyone will think it's their Springfield.' And they do,\" Mr Groening said. There are thought to be at least 34 towns or cities called Springfield in the US. Mr Groening also said he was inspired by the TV show Father Knows Best, which was set in a place called Springfield. But the Springfield in Oregon is just 100 miles (160km) south of Portland, the city where Mr Groening grew up. The Simpsons has sometimes given false answers to the question of Springfield's true location, leaving open the possibility that Mr Groening's latest comments are a continuation of the joke. \"Whenever people say it's Springfield, Ohio, or Springfield, Massachusetts, or Springfield, wherever, I always go: 'Yup, that's right,'\" Mr Groening said. In one episode, Marge and Homer Simpson's precocious daughter Lisa points to Springfield on a map, but the audience's view is obscured by Bart Simpson's head. It appears that the town of Springfield, Oregon, has known of its connection to the sitcom since 2007, when Mr Groening visited before the release of The Simpsons Movie. \"Oh, okay, we knew that,\" a community relations manager told the Associated Press when she heard about Mr Groening's latest comments.", "But they say it is still too early to say whether it is the remains of Swedish journalist Kim Wall. She was last seen alive on 10 August as she departed on a trip with submarine inventor Peter Madsen. He initially said he had dropped her off safely near Copenhagen, but has since said she died in an accident and that he had \"buried\" her at sea. The body has been sent for DNA analysis, but the results will not be available until Thursday morning. Divers continue to search the waters near where the torso was discovered, but, despite some reported sightings, other remains have not been found. \"The current situation is that there is a torso in which arms, legs and head have been removed off as a result of deliberate cutting,\" said Jens Moller Jensen of the Copenhagen police. \"There is nothing about the length of the torso to indicate that it is not Kim Wall, but we do not yet know.\" Ms Wall, 30, was a freelance journalist who had graduated from the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism. She was based between New York and Beijing and had written for The Guardian and The New York Times. She was reported missing by her boyfriend after she failed to return from what should have been a short trip to research a feature about Mr Madsen and his submarine, the Nautilus. The submarine sank hours after the search for the journalist began, and Mr Madsen was charged with negligent manslaughter. Danish police believe the 40-tonne vessel was deliberately sunk by Mr Madsen, who was rescued before being arrested. The torso was found on Monday in shallows off the densely populated Danish island of Amager, on which the Danish capital of Copenhagen is partly situated. Mr Madsen denies any wrongdoing.

The 38-year-old long-distance swimmer from Cheltenham is hoping his sponsored Swim The Big Blue challenge will raise \u00c2\u00a31m for charity. Other people have attempted the swim, but were not ratified by Guinness World Records. French swimmer Benoit Lecomte was credited as the first to swim across the Atlantic without a kickboard in 1998, but this was not verified. Mr Hooper said he faces hazards such as storms and ocean predators. \"The idea is to get across safely and I think my only real fear is if something goes mechanically wrong with me. \"Beyond that I am not too worried about marine life. I am going into their world, so I need to be respectful,\" he said. \"I've already met sharks and jellyfish and nothing has eaten me yet.\" Mr Hooper is swimming freestyle front crawl for up to 12 hours a day, and will have to eat 12,000 calories a day to maintain his strength. He is accompanied by two support boats.  The crews include a medic, body therapist and an official observer who will be reporting back to Guinness. Nigel Taylor-Schofield, captain of one of the support vessels, said before the swim: \"There are not many 'firsts' left in this world and I am looking forward to helping Ben join that exclusive and elusive club.\" Mr Hooper has completed 12 million metres (7,456 miles) of ocean and pool swimming in preparation.", "The Women in Democracy Caucus also wants extra support for women AMs, and more women experts on TV and radio. Its leader - Presiding Officer Rosemary Butler - said women's voices were \"not being heard\". The Welsh government said banning companies from procurement processes would be illegal. However, a spokesman added: \"While we have to recognise this legal constraint, no-one should be in any doubt regarding our dedication to maximising women's participation in all areas of public life.\" The report was produced to coincide with International Women's Day. Dame Rosemary said: \"Women's voices are not being heard and our views are being overlooked, so I am working to address the need for more women to apply for and take up public roles and appointments.\"", "Are those voices being heard when it comes to the election?

The prize was Europe's biggest ever and was capped after a series of rollovers. On the night of the draw Chris was checking their numbers on the BBC's Red Button digital text service about midnight on the television in their bedroom. \"I started circling the numbers I had matched but wasn't doing very well. Then on the fifth line, all the circles seemed to join up.\" The telephone line run by Camelot for claims was closed. Chris and husband Colin sat up all night they were so excited. \"When we first realised we had won, it felt like a dream,\" Colin said. \"Everything went into slow motion.\" Life changing When asked at a media conference in Falkirk what they will do with the money, Chris said: \"We're not flashy people.\" \"The next steps are going to be the most difficult... with great wealth comes great responsibility,\" added Colin. The Weirs have both had serious health conditions in recent years and have not been able to work. Colin, 64, had previously worked as a television cameraman and Chris, 55, is a fully-trained psychiatric nurse. The most exciting aspect of their windfall is the opportunity to travel. \"We have both always wanted to see the Great Wall of China and Colin would love to stand at the foot of Ayers Rock in Australia,\" said Chris. \"We also love art galleries, so this gives us the chance to visit those in Paris and in Russia. These are all things we thought we would never see.\" They have also already decided to buy homes for their two children, Carly and Jamie (both in their 20s). UK winning streak Before Tuesday's draw, the largest lottery winner in the UK was the player who claimed \u00a3113m in the Euromillions last October and chose to remain anonymous. The couple have displaced former postal worker Angela Kelly from East Kilbride, who became Scotland's biggest winner in August 2007 when she scooped \u00a335,425,411.80 in the Euromillions jackpot. Britons have banked the Euromillions jackpot more than 14 times in the last two years. Last year, two anonymous UK winners scooped \u00a3113m and \u00a384m. And Nigel and Justine Page, from Gloucestershire, won the \u00a356m jackpot prize on EuroMillions in February 2010. National Lottery operator Camelot runs the Euromillions draw in the UK and has also had the same role for the weekly Lotto draw since it was launched in 1994. The firm says that its draws have created about 2,400 lottery millionaires in the UK in the intervening 17 years. If the winner of Tuesday's draw had been a single player, he or she would instantly have been placed 430th in this year's Sunday Times Rich List just above Scottish businessman Sir Angus Grossart and Irina Abramovich, the former wife of Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich.

The slumping price comes as OPEC - a group of the largest oil producing nations- refused to cut oil production. OPEC- whose production covers about 30% of the world's oil demand - met in Vienna last week to discuss production. The group has faced growing competition from new supplies, including in the US where techniques like fracking are used to tap previously hard-to-reach oil reserves. \"The decision by OPEC members to keep oil production output at record high levels has seen oil prices plummet again,\" said Sanjiv Shah, chief investment officer of Sun Global Investments. The group had traditionally kept a tight rein on oil production to regulate price, but announced last Friday it will continue to pump out approximately 31.5 million barrels of oil a day, going past the group's former 30 million barrel target. In 2014 Saudi Arabia led OPEC in a decision to keep output high to defend its market share.", "Alex Hartley took 4-24 and Katherine Brunt 3-35 as the hosts were bowled out for 155, despite captain Stafanie Taylor's 57. England looked tense at 56-2 in the chase, but Nat Sciver's unbeaten 58 saw them home with 67 balls to spare. The victory means England are one win away from World Cup qualification. That could - and should - be achieved on the tour of Sri Lanka in November, when England will play three matches in the ICC Women's Championship. Not only have Heather Knight's side moved a step closer to booking a place in the home tournament in 2017, they have secured an impressive series victory in her first overseas tour in charge. Without wicketkeeper Sarah Taylor, who remains on a break from the game to deal with an anxiety problem, and injured pace bowler Anya Shrubsole, they have beaten the World Twenty20 champions in hot, humid conditions and on slow, spin-friendly surfaces. It is those conditions that have made run-scoring so difficult and the toss so important - in all four previous matches the side batting first had gone on to win. England again had to field first, albeit the later sunshine made batting easier in the afternoon, and their bowlers ensured the run-chase would be manageable. After Brunt and Georgia Elwiss removed Shaquana Quintyne and Hayley Matthews respectively, Hartley and fellow spinner Laura Marsh got to work on the middle order. With Marsh providing the squeeze from one end, Hartley's accuracy induced poor strokes from Deandra Dottin, Merissa Aguilleira and Shemaine Campbelle. Taylor once again held the innings together with her third half-century in the five matches, but when she was stumped it gave Hartley a 13th wicket of the series, an England record in ODIs. With Brunt and off-spinner Knight running through the lower order, West Indies lost their last five wickets for 24 runs. England were in a strong position chasing 224 in the fourth ODI, only to give away five run-outs in a 42-run defeat. Here, they were restricted by West Indies' spinners early on, Lauren Winfield chipping Matthews to mid-wicket for 12 and Tammy Beaumont caught and bowled by Afy Fletcher for 34. With tension rising, the hosts threatened to find a way back into the match, especially with Knight dropped by Anisa Mohammed at short fine leg on only three. But the skipper combined with Sciver to reverse the pressure, scoring freely down the ground and, at one point, adding 26 runs in three overs. Though Knight was caught behind off impressive leg-spinner Fletcher, Sciver found an ally in the busy Danielle Wyatt on the way to her sixth ODI half-century. Wyatt was brilliantly caught at long-on by Britney Cooper, and Elwiss was bowled by Dottin, but there was to be no England wobble, with Amy Jones hitting the runs that sealed the series. England head coach Mark Robinson told BBC Sport: \"It's absolutely outstanding. We've had it tough. It's been ever so humid, red hot, and the wickets have been massively challenging. \"We've come to their back yard, they were on a high after winning the World T20 and we've shown a lot of character. I'm really proud of them. \"Hartley is a tough cookie. She doesn't shy from hard work and she's bowled outstandingly. She's got a big future if she keeps working hard. \"We're a young team and we're learning as we go. We feel we're going in the right direction and we feel we have shown everybody what we're made of.\" Ex-England batter Lydia Greenway on BBC Test Match Special: \"England have shown a huge amount of character. Everyone in this series has played their part. \"There have been little turning points in individuals' careers, like Lauren Winfield playing consistently. \"A sign of a good team is showing consistency in all different kinds of situations and I'm sure they will want to carry that on when they go to Sri Lanka.\"", "Yet while such a prospect would make most of us run a mile, this is in fact a traditional massage method in Russia. Called a \"venik\" massage, the oak bunches are first softened in warm water. And rather than being whacked on your back in anger, they are gently and rhythmically applied. It is a popular treatment in the thousands of steam bathhouses, or \"banyas\", across Russia. The massage, which takes place in a sauna room set at a temperature of 70C, is said to boost circulation and prevent premature ageing of the skin. And after the treatment has finished you are supposed to immediately jump into a plunge pool of cold water. You might think that such an unusual massage would struggle to be successfully exported from Russia, but the co-founder of the first banya in London says that two years after opening, almost half of its customers are non-Russians. Launching the banya, called Banya No.1, was the dream of entrepreneurial Russian ex-pat Ksenia Bobkova. The 37-year-old has lived in the UK for more than 20 years after moving from St Petersburg to study law at Edinburgh University in 1994. After graduating from Edinburgh she has had a successful career in finance in London, first working at a large commercial law firm, and then co-founding a new investment company. Yet as much as Ms Bobkova says she has always enjoyed living in the UK, the one thing she really missed was regular trips to a banya. After dreaming of opening London's first banya for more than a decade, Ms Bobkova says that in 2012 \"the circumstances came together\" to enable her to finally start work on it. Firstly, she realised that more and more Russians were now living in London, which she hoped would make a banya commercially viable, and she had built up enough savings to launch the business. Then she found the right building, and two other UK-based Russian investors came on board. After a year of construction work, including importing a traditional banya stove from Russia, the bathhouse opened its doors in 2013. \"When we wrote the business plan, we certainly focused on the fact that the Russian-speaking community in London had grown substantially over the past 15 years,\" she says. \"But after we opened we soon discovered that London is so international, and that people who live here are so open to new experiences, that almost half our customers are non-Russian.\" Customers - both male and female - who don't want to strip naked can instead wear their swimming costume, or a strategically placed towel. And for people who wish to avoid the oak leaves, Scandinavian-style, hands-based back massages are also available. After the massages, people are encouraged to stay and relax in a lounge or rest area, where they can order traditional Russian food. While Ms Bobkova is reluctant to discuss how financially successful the banya is, it is often full, and typical visits cost \u00c2\u00a3100 per person. And she now plans to open more branches. Running the banya is a world apart from Ms Bobkova's main job of helping to lead investment firm Fusion Asset Management, of which she was a founding partner in 2004. The business invests millions of pounds globally on behalf of large institutions, and has a sister office in Moscow. While the original six founders included one Englishman, an American and a Frenchman, it is now owned and run by three London-based Russian ex-pats. Ms Bobkova says that she likes working in the UK, because she values what she describes as \"British fair play\" in business. \"Without comparing specifically to Russia, what is very fundamental in British business ethics is this concept of fair play,\" she says. \"[Doing business in the UK means] you can trust people, and people will generally not try to squeeze you too much. In the UK both sides get a fairly allocated share of the profit, rather than one gets all, and the other gets nothing.\" In terms of her day-to-day style as a boss she says that while she has high expectations of staff, it is a point of principle that the 20 people at the finance firm don't have to work late nights or at weekends. \"Nothing in the world is so important that it needs to be done at the weekend,\" she says. In addition to the two businesses, Ms Bobkova is also a co-founder of a networking organisation for Russians living and working in London. Called Russians in the City, and with 2,300 members, it holds quarterly events, such as drinks parties, or polo matches and skiing trips. The world is getting wealthier - but with the gap between rich and poor feeling bigger than ever, who are the winners and losers of this richer world in 2015? A Richer World 2015 Listen to the reports and documentaries The organisation has since opened a sister branch in Switzerland, with other ones due to open in New York and Dubai. A UK passport holder, and previously married to a British husband, Ms Bobkova says that Russians in the City allow her to maintain the Russian side of her identity. \"I'm British in that I have lived here for 20 years, but I'm also obviously Russian,\" she says. \"There are different categories of immigrants. Some are so integrated that they almost deny where they came from, while at the other end, some people don't integrate at all. \"I'm somewhere in the middle, I'm fully integrated, I went to a British university...

The US Department of Labour reported that US employers added 211,000 jobs in April, and the unemployment rate dropped slightly to 4.4% from 4.5% in March. Some car companies and other retailers have been reporting weak sales figures. However the jobs numbers were welcomed by the market as a sign that consumer spending, the mainstay of the American economy, is unlikely to diminish. GDP growth also slowed in the first three month of 2017, but the period is often subject to data distortions. The Federal Reserve said earlier this week it believed any slowdown was temporary. \"The Fed has made clear it is going to look through some of the weak economic data that's been coming through as they believe the fundamentals of the economy are strong. This number is something of a vindication of that view,\" said Luke Bartholomew at Aberdeen Asset Management. But retail's troubles have not disappeared.

Police said it was \"almost a miracle\" that a boy and a girl who were on the raft survived. Friends and colleagues of those who died have been speaking out. Kate Goodchild, 32, was on a family holiday to attend a wedding, and decided to extend their trip to go the Gold Coast theme park. She was a public servant in Canberra and had two daughters with her husband Dave, a 12-year-old girl and an eight-month-old baby. She was travelling on the ride with her 12-year-old, who survived the collision, and with her brother Luke Dorsett and his partner Roozbeh Araghi, both of whom died. Ms Goodchild's mother, Kim Dorsett, having lost a son and a daughter, said her family has been \"wiped out\". \"They really were just wonderful people - that would be the best way to describe them. They were kind, loving souls that would honestly do anything for anyone,\" she told News Corp Australia. \"I have two granddaughters ... and it truly breaks my heart to know that my eight-month-old is never going to get to know her mum.\" Luke Dorsett, 35, and his partner Roozbeh Araghi, were known for winning a high-profile legal battle with Canberra's local government over stamp duty in 2014. Mr Dorsett and his sister both worked for the Department of Human Services. \"Kate and Luke were well-liked and respected by their colleagues and will be greatly missed,\" a department spokeswoman said in a statement. Radio presenter Patricia Karvelas praised Mr Araghi and Mr Dorsett as loyal friends. \"They never missed one of my girls' birthdays. They never forgot to check in,\" she said. \"Words fail me.\" A friend said both men were amazing. \"Canberra is a very small gay community, everyone knew them or knows someone who knew them,\" Douglas Robinson said on Facebook. It is understood that Mr Araghi, 38, was originally from Sydney where he studied history and edited the student newspaper, Honi Soit. He worked for the Australian Bureau of Statistics, which in a statement described him as a hardworking member of its communications team \"who brought joy and fun to the workplace\". Australian Senator Sam Dastyari said he grew up with Mr Araghi. \"I'm devastated that such a caring, loving, sweet and sensitive friend has been lost,\" Mr Dastyari wrote on Twitter. \"I'm angry that this could happen at a venue like Dreamworld.\" Mr Araghi's family found out about his death from a TV news report. \"My second son found out accidentally on the news,\" said Mr Araghi's father, Behrooz. \"We've lost one son,\" he added, \"The mother of my son's partner lost two [children].\" Cindy Low, 42, originally from New Zealand, lived in Sydney with her husband Matthew and their 10-year-old son and six-year-old daughter. She was on a holiday to the Gold Coast with her family and some other friends, according to media reports. Whilst queuing for the ride, she decided to separate from her husband and daughter, choosing instead to travel in a separate raft with her son and four strangers. The decision proved fateful to her, though her son miraculously survived. Her husband and her daughter who were in the other raft, were both unharmed but extremely distressed. \"She just kept screaming 'Where's Mummy?

The Briton said: \"You can't win them all. Look at the great champions who lost titles. It's part of the game. \"I'm going to give it everything I've got and everything is possible.\" Should he lose, Hamilton said \"life would move on\" and he would hopefully \"come back stronger\". The 31-year-old has won three of the four US Grands Prix held at the Circuit of the Americas since the event made its debut in 2012, and said he was \"excited\" about the weekend. Hamilton pointed out he has the worst of the reliability issues at Mercedes this year, with engine problems affecting his results at four separate races, including a failure while leading in Malaysia earlier this month. Without these problems, Hamilton would be leading the championship rather than trailing Rosberg, who has so far had only one reliability issue affect his points total, costing him three points at the British Grand Prix. Hamilton said: \"We have always had close battles. If all things were equal, there would be a certain result. \"This year has been a little different in terms of how our performances have been mechanically and there is nothing I can do about that. \"When the car has been good, I have often done the job with it and there has been a few, especially in the first few seconds of the race, when I have not done that well. But that's motor racing.\" Hamilton has had five bad starts this year that have cost him positions, compared to three for Rosberg. He said he had been working on the problem again with Mercedes before coming to Austin. \"It has been an ongoing thing all year long - perhaps more work than in other areas,\" he said. \"I was working on it at the factory last week and we hope we have a better formula this weekend.\" Hamilton's behaviour in the pre-race news conference on Thursday was very different from his controversial performance in the same event in Japan two weeks ago. In Suzuka, he was relatively disengaged from the process, referring journalists to his social media outlets for answers to questions, and spent time posting pictures on Snapchat of himself and fellow driver Carlos Sainz with cartoon animal features. In Austin, he was polite and concentrated and gave long, considered, thoughtful answers - much more his normal self. He also explained why some journalists had been blocked from following him on Twitter, saying he had only recently found out about it. \"I don't manage every single part of my social media,\" Hamilton said. \"I have a couple of people doing it for me. It was a blocking spree. I don't even have the app on my phone.\" He said the general approach was for people to be blocked if they said something negative - and those affected had not just been journalists. Ferrari driver Sebastian Vettel said Hamilton had every chance of ending the year with a fourth title. Asked if it was realistic for Hamilton to catch Rosberg, the four-time champion said: \"Of course. He is quick enough and there are enough races. \"I am sure he will go for it.

The apes began to disappear from the documents about 150 years ago, corresponding with population growth. The study is published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Hainan gibbons are now limited to a few isolated patches of forest in the south west of China. They live in just four social groups, one of which was only discovered a few weeks ago. Understanding this population crash has been difficult, but the old government documents have helped to reveal when and how the numbers fell. Dr Sam Turvey, from the Zoological Society of London, said: \"China is one of the few places in the world that has a very very rich, long historical record. \"Because it has had such a complex bureaucracy for so long, there has been a lot of need for reporting - not just numbers of households for tax purposes and things like that, but also in terms of the kinds of  natural resources that were available in the immediate environment.\" These included records of animals, including gibbons, he said. \"We looked at the pattern of disappearance of gibbons through time and how that varied from place to place and the different environmental conditions and human pressures that were also present in these places.\" The archives show that gibbons were a common sight in about 20 provinces in China well into the 17th and 18th Century. However, Dr Turvey said it was \"a stark contrast to their very imperilled position today\". \"We see a really steep increase in population decline and real population collapse across China about 100-150 years ago,\" he added. \"And this correlates with demographic expansion in China towards the end of the Imperial era and through the 20th Century, and the massive increase in deforestation and human population growth through the time of the Chinese Republic and the establishment of the communist party.\" The researchers said a better understanding of the animals' decline would help them to establish a conservation plan for the country's last few Hainan gibbons. Dr Turvey said: \"It is an incredible privilege to be able to see gibbons in China in the wild. \"The Hainan gibbon is such as rare species, but knowing that this species is still hanging on there gives you hope that conservation will be able to bring that population back from the brink.\" Follow Rebecca on Twitter", "Trevor O'Neill was shot outside a supermarket in Majorca just after 21:00 local time on Wednesday, Irish national broadcaster RT\u00c3\u2030 reports. His shooting is understood to be linked to a feud between Irish criminal gangs. Mr O'Neill's partner and three children, aged five, seven and 10, were with him when the attack happened. They had travelled to Majorca on Saturday for a holiday for his 40th birthday. Police believe the attack was connected to a dispute between the Hutch and Kinahan groups, but Mr O'Neill was not the intended victim. The feud between the gangs was sparked by the killing of Dubliner Gary Hutch in Spain last year and most of the resulting violence and murders have happened in Dublin. Attempts to revive Mr O'Neill at the scene failed and police are said to be searching for up to three suspects. It is understood that he was not linked to organised crime but may have been talking to a member of the Hutch family at the time.", "According to reports, South Korea sports minister Do Jong-hwan said North Korea could host some skiing events.

The hospital trust says interim safety measures are in place during the work. Skanska, which built the hospital under a private finance initiative (PFI) scheme, declined to comment. More reaction to the story David Eltringham, chief operating officer at University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust, said: \"We can assure our patients, staff and visitors that we remain vigilant in ensuring fire safety standards are maintained at all times.\" He said the trust \"learned of some potential issues with the infrastructure\" which prompted the internal investigation. The investigation found that \"in the unlikely event of a fire, the structures to prevent it spreading were not as robust as those specified in the original plan for the building\", Mr Eltringham added. The trust says it collaborated with Skanska to identify remedial work and is working with the fire service to optimise fire safety standards. Meanwhile, steps are being taken to strengthen fire safety including additional patrols and increasing rubbish collections. A West Midlands Fire Service spokesman said: \"We are working together with University Hospital Coventry and have an action plan in place for upgrading fire standards.\" Construction firm Skanska, which was paid to build the hospital, said it had nothing further to add to the statement issued by the trust.", "Media playback is not supported on this device World number one Selby, the 2014 champion, looked impressive as he went 3-0 ahead with half-century breaks in frames two and three. Hong Kong's Fu hit back with a 72, and the pair shared four frames after the mid-session interval. China's Ding Junhui leads Alan McManus 6-2 in the other semi-final. Both Ding and Fu are hoping to become the first Asian player to win the sport's showpiece event. But Fu's chances appear fainter than Ding's after a characteristically dogged effort by Leicester's Selby in the best-of-33 contest. World number 14 Fu began anxiously, perhaps affected by the late jitters that saw him surrender a 9-1 lead in his 13-11 win over Barry Hawkins. Selby won a scrappy opener in which both men wasted a couple of chances, and he also took the second frame with a diligent 56. At 3-0 behind Fu made the most of a decent opening to score a well-constructed 72 before pinching a thrilling fifth frame full of incredible escapes, missed chances and numerous flukes. A 31-minute frame then went Selby's way for him to lead to 4-2 before they shared the final two frames, Fu with a fluent 89 and Selby scoring 69. Fu fought back impressively to keep alive his chances of going one better than Thailand's James Wattana - the first player from Asia to reach the last four at the Crucible. In 1993, the same year as the first of Wattana's two appearances, McManus graced that stage of the event for the second time But, 23 years on, the veteran Scot's hopes of progressing further look slim. Ding was in intimidating form from the start, opening with a break of 100 and scoring two further tons and two half-centuries to go 5-0 up. McManus, at 45, the oldest man to reach a Crucible semi-final since Ray Reardon in 1985, had scored just 47 points. But he showed his tactical nous to win two lengthy frames and get back to 5-2, before Ding ended with a 128. McManus did little wrong in the first five frames, but had every minor mistake punished by the world number 17. Ding had to win three qualifying rounds to reach this stage, but seems to have benefited from the extra table time. The 29-year-old has looked increasingly sharp, and has stayed fresh thanks to his fluent form which earned him an extra day's rest for beating Mark Williams inside two sessions in the quarter-finals. John Parrott, 1991 world champion: \"Ding was superb. His break building and his match play has been fantastic. But I think he needed to win the last frame. The way he dominated the session, if he hadn't come out of it at least 6-2 he would have been kicking himself.\"", "The three-time champion jockey, 32, has not put a timescale on his return to the saddle. \"I'm not going to rush it,\" he said. \"I want to be 100% for all the major races in the autumn.\" Moore looks set to miss York's four-day Ebor Festival, one of the biggest fixtures on the flat-racing calendar, which begins on 17 August. The major autumn races include the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, British Champions Day, the Breeders' Cup and the Melbourne Cup. The lay-off will damage his chances of winning the jockeys' championship for a fourth time. Moore, the number one rider for Irish trainer Aidan O'Brien, is second with 57 winners this year, two behind Silvestre de Sousa. He finished as top rider at the recent Goodwood Festival with eight victories. \"I have been a bit sore for the last couple of weeks and been advised by a specialist that complete rest is the best option,\" he added. \"I'm going to play it by ear, but hope to be back soon.\" Moore was sidelined for two months last year with a neck injury.

England all-rounder Moeen Ali, Joe Clarke, Brett D'Oliveira and Tom Kohler-Cadmore have all reached three figures for the New Road side and Rhodes says better pitches will help sort out the best players. \"Too many good players were playing forward defensive shots and getting out to average bowlers - that's what was happing before with the wickets,\" he added. \"Now those bowlers are struggling a little bit - which I think is a good thing.\"", "Sam Gould said the proportional representation element of the assembly electoral system would give UKIP \"six or seven\" seats, if it repeated its general election performance. But he told BBC Wales the party was \"definitely\" capable of winning more. UKIP got more than 200,000 votes in Wales in May, more than both Plaid Cymru and the Liberal Democrats. It came second in six of the 40 Welsh seats but, under the first past the post system, did not win any. The closest it came was Mr Gould in Caerphilly, who was beaten by Labour's Wayne David by around 10,000 votes. UKIP's campaign in Wales also had several problems, including one of its candidates threatening to sue the party for libel, and its regional organiser stepping down. The party believes the regional list system - whereby 20 of the 60 AMs are elected under a form of proportional representation - gives it a strong chance at the assembly election. Former Conservative and UKIP MP Mark Reckless has been given the job of developing the manifesto and it is planning to appoint spokespeople on each of the main devolved policy areas. Local branches will select the 40 constituency candidates by the autumn, while regional list candidates will be picked by a central committee. Mr Gould said: \"The (general election) performance was absolutely fantastic and we are so pleased with this foundation ready for next year's assembly election. \"If we were to run the same number of votes across Wales we would get seven AMs under the list system. \"So we're very confident of breaking through next year in the assembly election. \"I think seven seats would be a success, but I think we're in with a very good chance of achieving more.\" He added: \"Mark Reckless will be coming to Wales to work with a Wales-based policy team to help us turn the ideas we have from our local grassroots Welsh representatives into a reality in our manifesto.\" There has never been a UKIP assembly member, but the party had a Welsh MEP elected in 2009 and 2014.", "The Tyco BMW rider, who was injured in a 130mph crash at Ireland's Corner last August, also sat out this year's North West 200 and Isle of Man TT.

In an unrelated case, the FBI wants Apple to unlock the iPhone of Syed Rizwan Farook, who killed 14 people in San Bernardino, California in December. But Apple has resisted, calling that demand \"dangerous\" and \"unprecedented\". The ruling in Brooklyn on Monday centres on the same point as the San Bernardino case. The two court cases are not linked - the magistrate in San Bernardino doesn't have to pay any attention to the ruling and remarks from the New York judge. But Apple feels the decision in New York gives added strength to its position. A senior Apple spokesman told reporters in a conference call that he was confident the San Bernardino judge would carefully analyse the New York ruling. Most promising for Apple is the reason for which Judge Orenstein threw out the New York case. He said he was not at all convinced the All Writs Act, a law more than two centuries old, could be used to force Apple to comply. The same law is being used in San Bernardino. The All Writs Act is designed to give law enforcement powers not specifically addressed in other laws - but using it requires meeting certain strict criteria, too burdensome to detail here. No legal precedent has been set here - but as the magistrate in San Bernardino considers her ruling, momentum certainly appears to be with the computing giant. Apple v the FBI - a plain English guide Apple's boss hits back at FBI conduct Bill Gates calls for terror data debate Fourteen people were killed and 22 injured when gunman Farook and his wife Tashfeen Malik opened fire in the Californian city in December. A court order in California demanded Apple help circumvent security software on Farook's iPhone, which the FBI said contains crucial information. Apple's CEO Tim Cook said the request was \"an overreach by the US government\" and risked giving authorities \"the power to reach into anyone's device to capture their data\". Last week, the company asked a court to overturn the ruling. The same Act from 1789 that was used by the FBI in the San Bernardino request was applied in the Brooklyn case. But Judge James Orenstein said the Act was not applicable in this case, adding that it was not right to impose \"on Apple the obligation to assist the government's investigation against its will\". The US Justice Department said it planned to appeal against the Brooklyn ruling.", "The Board of Community Health Councils (CHCs) is refusing to say why chief executive Tony Rucinski was suspended. Emails show that before his suspension Dr Rucinski raised concerns the board's chair Mutale Merrill may have been influenced by a government minister to stop him doing media interviews. Ms Merill said she does not accept the emails' content is \"factually correct\". Dr Rucinski said he has been \"instructed not to comment.\" The organisation describes itself as the \"independent voice of patients\" in Wales. It and the seven CHCs it oversees had an annual budget in 2015-16 of \u00c2\u00a33.8m. Dr Rucinski was appointed as chief executive of the Board of Community Health Councils in a newly-created role in July 2015. At the time, he told BBC Wales that he had been \"put in place to make things happen\". He said he wanted CHCs to become a \"much more proactive and effective patient voice\". Four months later the Welsh Government appointed Ms Merrill as the board's new chair. Dr Rucinski was then suspended in February 2016. Several sources have told BBC Wales that there was tension between Mr Rucinski and Ms Merrill prior to his suspension. In emails written to Ms Merrill before his suspension, obtained by BBC Wales, Mr Rucinski raises concerns about being stopped from doing interviews on a Welsh Government digital health initiative in December 2015 and on a report by the OECD think tank comparing UK health services in February 2016. In the emails Dr Rucinski stated that his job description involved doing media interviews and suggested he felt Ms Merill's instructions to him not to do interviews may have been influenced by a meeting with a Welsh Government minister. He wrote: \"I am genuinely concerned about the comments you have relayed from your meeting with the minister.\" Following his suspension, a board meeting was held in which Ms Merrill appears to try to explain the disagreement over media coverage between her and the chief executive. The minutes state that Ms Merrill said a \"media embargo\" had \"only been imposed on the chief executive regarding this one news item [the OECD story]\", and \"it was noted that there was some context behind this decision which could not be shared, however the board chair had required the chief executive to provide a briefing prior to the commenting on any issue in order to decide the best approach and deliver the message to the media\". \"A conversation regarding a need for a media protocol had been discussed with the chief executive,\" the minutes said. The document also said that the chief executive had shared a text message from Ms Merrill with staff \"without her knowledge and without context of previous discussions\". Following his suspension Dr Rucinski claimed in an email to the Wales Audit Office in April 2016 that Ms Merrill \"informed me verbally that the minister had instructed her to not let me do any further media engagements or public appearances\". In that email he also said he believed \"the independent voice of patients and the public in Wales has been gagged during a crucial time for healthcare debate nationally\". Alyson Thomas and Clare Jenkins are in \"acting chief executive\" roles. Dr Rucinski was previously chief executive of the Macular Society from March to November 2014. Ms Merill said: \"I can confirm on behalf of the Board of Community Health Councils in Wales that there are ongoing personnel processes relating to the chief executive officer and due process is being followed in respect of those matters.\" Ms Merill added that she did not accept that Mr Rucinski's allegations in the emails were factually correct and said she was unable to provide further comment at this stage whilst internal processes are ongoing. Dr Ruckinski said: \"I have been instructed not to comment.\" BBC Wales understands the Welsh Government was made aware of the suspension. A spokesman for Welsh ministers said: \"The suspension of Mr Rucinski is wholly an internal matter for the CHC Board. \"It is not appropriate for us to comment any further.\" A spokeswoman for public spending watchdog the Wales Audit Office said: \"We have received correspondence on this matter but after careful consideration we have concluded that it seems to fall outside of the remit of the auditor general, though we will naturally keep a close eye on any developments.\"", "In the year to the end of March, 57 victims of homicide (murders and culpable homicides) were recorded - down five on the previous 12 months. This is the lowest number of recorded homicide cases for a single 12-month period since 1976 and half the figure of nine years ago. As of 31 March 2016, only one case of homicide recorded in 2015-16 was unresolved. The report Homicide in Scotland showed that a sharp instrument remained the most common method of killing in Scotland and accounted for 51% of homicides (29 cases) in 2015-16. Nearly all of these cases (26 out of 29) involved a knife. While the majority of the accused had an unknown status for alcohol and drugs, 31% (20 people) were identified by the police as being under the influence of alcohol or alcohol and drugs. Justice Secretary Michael Matheson said: \"While it is encouraging to see continued falls in homicide cases alongside the long-term decline in violent crime, the sustained efforts that have helped achieve this - through education and enforcement - must continue, because each of the lives lost is one life too many. \"There is a clear role across a range of public services, in addition to the critical work of our police, to continue to support communities that may remain at risk from violent crime and to challenge irresponsible attitudes both to alcohol misuse and to so-called 'casual' violence. \"We will continue to work with partners and invest in a range of projects to help steer our young people away from the risks of a life of violence and crime, while also ensuring our law enforcement agencies and the courts have the powers and resources needed to deal with those who do harm to others.\" Scottish Labour's justice spokeswoman Claire Baker said: \"Whilst I welcome the overall downward trend in homicides in Scotland we have to take these statistics with a note of caution. \"Last year when the Scottish government were heralding 'record low' homicide figures after a supposed similar drop, the actual figures were being revised upwards to show an increase. \"Meanwhile, sexual crime in Scotland sits at a 45-year high and in the past year we have seen an increase in violent crime with attempted murder and serious assault rising by a staggering 27%.\" The number of homicide victims for 2014-15 stood at 59 last year but later increased to 62, after three cases were reclassified following deaths.", "Mr MacAskill made the announcement at HMP Shotts, one of two pilot sites for the technology. The move follows legislation allowing the Scottish Prison Service to interfere with mobile phone signals. The technology should enable prison authorities to detect and prevent prisoners' use of contraband phones. The Scottish Prison Service (SPS) awarded contracts for the installation of the technology at HMPs Shotts and Glenochil. The two pilot sites are expected to be operating the technology by the end of the current financial year. Mr MacAskill said: \"This government made it a criminal offence for a prisoner to possess a mobile phone and the Scottish Prison Service has already invested considerably in the use of technology and intelligence capability to detect and prevent the use of mobile phones in our prisons. \"This new legislation will allow SPS to further extend their technology to disrupt the use of mobile phones by prisoners and is scheduled to be operational in a matter of weeks.\" The Scottish Prison Service has linked mobile phone use in prison to criminal activities including the supply of drugs, organised crime and harassment. Possession of a mobile phone by people in custody has been illegal since 2010. The SPS said 1,988 mobile phone handsets had been detected in Scottish prisons since 2011 - 212 of them in HMP Shotts.

But we have to be honest with ourselves. We were not good enough to compete for the Premier League [title].\" Defeat at Stamford Bridge left City just four points ahead of Arsenal and Manchester United, both of whom have a game in hand. With the FA Cup being City's only realistic chance of winning a trophy this term, it is likely to be the worst season of Guardiola's managerial career. The 46-year-old has never gone a single season without winning a trophy - he has won the title in six out of seven attempts and his sides have always reached the last four of the Champions League. Guardiola has also responded to questions about a row between City and Chelsea coaching staff at Stamford Bridge following the defeat on Wednesday night. There have been conflicting claims about the precise nature of the row, but stewards were needed to calm the situation down after Chelsea's 2-1 win. The incident centred around a disagreement between Chelsea fitness coach Paolo Bertelli and Manchester City masseur Mark Sertori, both of whom speak Italian, as the Premier League leaders celebrated their victory.

Chelsea manager Antonio Conte was not involved and has played the incident down. He said: \"Respect is the most important thing in football.\"", "The bodies of David Miller, 24, and Hannah Witheridge, 23, were discovered on a beach in Koh Tao on 15 September. Metropolitan Police officers flew out last month to work with Thai police, who are holding two Burmese suspects. The UK detectives will now compile a report and \"update the families of Hannah and David,\" a spokesman said. \"Detectives from the UK who are currently in Thailand reviewing the investigation into the murders of Hannah Witheridge and David Miller have completed their work, as far as possible,\" the Met Police said in a statement. \"They will now be returning to the UK to compile their report and to update the families of Hannah and David on their findings. \"The police team wish to thank the Thai authorities for facilitating the visit.\" Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Htun, both migrant workers from Myanmar, also known as Burma, are alleged to have confessed to the killings. Thai police have denied subsequent reports that the pair, both aged 21, have since withdrawn their confessions. The two suspects are charged with conspiracy to murder, conspiracy to rape and robbery, and could face the death penalty if found guilty. However, the UK Foreign Office last month summoned the Thai charge d'affaires to express concerns about the police investigation. The concerns are understood to have been around the verification of DNA samples of the suspects and allegations of their mistreatment. The UK police visit came after Thai Prime Minister Gen Prayuth Chan-ocha met Mr Cameron at a summit in Italy and agreed that a delegation of British officers could travel to Thailand. He had previously rejected offers of assistance. Post-mortem examinations found Mr Miller, from Jersey, died from drowning and a blow to the head, while Miss Witheridge, from Great Yarmouth, died from head wounds. Thai police have said DNA found on Ms Witheridge matched samples taken from the suspects.", "In a statement (in French) it said it was \"worried about the continued worsening of the situation\". On Saturday, Turkey began shelling the militia, which it says is linked to the banned Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). The fighters, the YPG militia based in Syria, have rejected Turkey's demand to leave areas it has seized, saying Islamists would return if it left. Turkey's assault is a new thread in an already-complex conflict that has drawn in competing regional powers. Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu insisted on Sunday that Turkey \"will not permit the [Kurdish militia] to carry out aggressive acts\". \"Our security forces gave the necessary response and will continue to do so,\" Mr Davutoglu said. Syria has also condemned the Turkish action as a violation of its sovereignty and asked the UN Security Council to intervene. France also called on the Syrian regime and its allies to stop their bombardments \"across the whole of the country\". France said priority should be given to implementing an agreement reached in Munich this week on ceasing hostilities, and the fight against so-called Islamic State (IS) group. Almost five years of civil war in Syria have led to the deaths of more than 250,000 people. More than 11 million people have been displaced. How Putin is succeeding in Syria Displaced Syrians struggle to survive Syria: The story of the conflict Turkey v Islamic State v the Kurds: What's going on? Attempts to broker a peace deal have repeatedly failed, but on Thursday, world leaders agreed to work towards a so-called cessation of hostilities in Syria within a week. The US and Russian presidents agreed in a \"frank and business-like\" phone call to work more closely to achieve this, the Kremlin said on Sunday. Russia, an ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, has been carrying out air strikes since September against what it terms \"terrorists\". Among the targets shelled by Turkey is the Menagh airbase, which was seized by the YPG on Thursday from Syrian Islamist rebels. The YPG controls much of Syria's northern border with Turkey. Syria's war hardly needs a new front, but another has now opened up. Ankara sees the Kurdish PYD party and its YPG militia as terrorist organisations. It's worried that weapons are seeping over the border from Syria to the PKK, with which Turkey has renewed its armed conflict since a ceasefire broke down last year. Washington rejects Ankara's view that the PYD is a terrorist organisation, seeing it instead as an effective ally against so-called Islamic State (IS). That has caused rifts between the two Nato allies and is hampering international peace talks. Syria is the stage for several proxy wars, and Turkey has just started another, going after its Kurdish nemesis there and vowing to stop the PYD from cementing control of northern Syria. Turkey's state-run Anadolu Agency said Turkish forces shot at Kurdish fighters inside Syria on Sunday after coming under fire themselves. Ankara sees the group as being linked with Kurdish guerrillas from PKK, which has waged a campaign against security forces in Turkey for decades. In other developments: Under the agreed cessation of hostilities plan, efforts will be made to try to make urgent aid deliveries to besieged and hard-to-reach areas in Syria. Steps will also be taken to work towards an eventual ceasefire and implementation of a UN-backed plan for political transition in Syria. The halt would not apply to the battle against the jihadists of IS and al-Nusra Front. However, neither the Syrian government nor the rebels were involved in the deal and both have since vowed to continue fighting. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said on Friday that he intended to retake \"the whole country\" from rebels - a statement the US government said was \"deluded\". Syrian government forces, backed by Russian air strikes, have almost encircled rebels in parts of the northern city of Aleppo. Also on Sunday, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev repeated a warning that any foreign ground operation in Syria would lead to \"a full-fledged, long war\". Turkey has said its troops and forces from Saudi Arabia might participate in a ground operation against IS.", "The grant will see six hectares of Broadcroft Quarry in Portland, Dorset, restored and opened as a trail. The two-year project is one of the first steps towards the main Jurassica attraction, which is planned in the 40m (132ft) deep quarry. The work will see a team of more than 100 volunteers work with conservation experts at the Dorset Wildlife Trust. Funding for the attraction is being raised through donations, grants and sponsorship from businesses. The proposed subterranean park on the World Heritage Site would see a glass and steel roof, about a third the size of the Millennium Dome, installed over the quarry. It would house an aquarium with robot swimming plesiosaurs, fossils and interactive displays. The charity behind the museum, which will cover three geological time periods, said it planned to submit a full planning application later this year. Sir David Attenborough is the project's patron and the Eden Project's Sir Tim Smit is its trustee. It also has the backing of the Royal Society and the Natural History Museum. Jurassica is the idea of science writer Michael Hanlon who died last year aged 51 after a heart attack.", "Gino Asquith was born on 9 November 2014, but died three days later. His mother, Sarah Ellis, had been sent home from the hospital two days earlier as there were no free beds. She was seen by eight medics before having an emergency caesarean after they failed to spot signs of distress. Recording a verdict of death by misadventure Coroner Oliver Longstaff said there had been four missed chances to provide medical input. The inquest heard that after Ms Ellis was turned away by Calderdale Royal Hospital (CRH), in Halifax, she went to Huddersfield Birthing Centre, but was sent home on 8 November as her labour was not in an advanced stage. The following day she went back to CRH as she could no longer feel her baby moving but was told she was not dilated enough and was left in the Maternity Assessment Unit for six hours. She later underwent an emergency Caesarean section after being seen by a consultant. Gino had to be resuscitated twice after his birth. Mr Longtsaff said: \"At the very least the delays in Gino being delivered made the chance of him being born alive significantly reduced.\" Speaking after the inquest, Ms Ellis and her partner Adam Asquith said: \"Words cannot explain what we have been through in losing our first child together in this terrible way. \"It is hard to accept that the delays we faced and the failure to pick up signs that Gino was in distress led to his death. \"We can only hope that by speaking out we will ensure lessons are learned and that mothers and their babies are in the best possible hands when they are at their most vulnerable.\" Calderdale and Huddersfield NHS Foundation Trust admitted liability for Gino's death in a civil case ahead of the inquest.", "Kirsty Blackman, SNP MP for Aberdeen North, found a toy rabbit at the Carriage Gates entrance last July. She tried to trace the owner on social media but no-one came forward for months. After turning to Mumsnet, a user got in touch at Hogmanay, saying the toy belonged to her six-year-old daughter. The woman said she worked near Westminster at the time and her daughter was \"gutted\" when the bunny went missing as they had been \"inseparable since birth\". She reclaimed the toy on a visit to the House of Commons on Wednesday. Ms Blackman updated followers on the toy's time at Westminster, including pictures of her and the Jellycat Bashful Bunny with Big Ben behind them and at Prime Minister's Questions. She also drafted an Early Day Motion stating the House of Commons is \"saddened by the discovery of the abandoned bashful bunny by the gates of the Palace of Westminster\" which was not submitted to parliament but was signed by several SNP colleagues. Ms Blackman said previously: \"I have two young children, so I know the devastation that can be caused when a toy is lost.\"", "They say the government is failing to promote back-to-nature schemes which protect lowland homes by deliberately creating floods in the hills. The Chartered Institution of Water and Environmental Management (CIWEM) say upland schemes to slow river flow cost a fraction of conventional flood walls \u2013 and should be spread round the UK. Ministers back the principle but say the details need to be worked out. The idea of creating floods upstream to prevent floods downstream was a key message from the Pitt Review into the 2007 floods. A handful of pilot projects have pioneered cheap small-scale measures like felling trees into streams to slow down the flow, and building earth banks to catch run-off water and allow it to soak away. One low-tech scheme in the hills above Belford in Northumberland cost about \u00a3300,000. It was put in place after a study suggested the cost of conventional flood defences would cost \u00a34m. But progress nationally has been slow, with funding a major problem. Katherine Pygott, from CIWEM, told the BBC: \u201cFlooding is getting worse with changing weather patterns, but these schemes are taking a very long time and a lot of energy. \u201cProjects working with nature to reduce flood risk are needed right across the country but it is complicated with many different organisations involved and it will need political leadership from the highest level to make it happen. So far we haven\u2019t seen that leadership.\u201d The upland schemes are designed to reduce the regularity of flooding, not remove risk completely. Conventional flood defences will still be needed but CIWEM estimates that re-wilding rivers will save ten of millions by reducing the peak flow and lowering the specification for flood walls. The projects should also benefit wildlife. Phil Welton, from the Environment Agency, says the UK should aspire to have \"a pond in every field in the areas where flood prevention is needed. \"We have got to give incentives to farmers to persuade them to capture water on their land,\" he argues. \"Farmers will lose a bit of land \u2013 but these areas are only wet for two to three days a year and quite often they are on bits of land that farmers don't use \u2013 boggy areas or buffer strips.\u201d Incentives for farmers are one key sticking point. In theory, funds from the Common Agricultural Policy can be used for catchment management but in practice Ms Pygott says that the standard of proof is much higher than for biodiversity projects which can also be supported under the CAP. \u201cWith biodiversity schemes a farmer simply has to show that he has changed the land in a way that\u2019s expected to benefit wildlife,\" she adds. \"With flood schemes they have to prove what the benefits will be and that\u2019s very hard. \"We obviously don\u2019t want to be wasting government money on the wrong projects but with weather patterns changing it really makes sense to take a leap of faith on this and say it\u2019s obvious these schemes are going to help if you get them in the right place.\u201d While farmers\u2019 union NFU supports the idea in principle, it maintains it is not a \"panacea\" and will not alleviate flood risk in all parts of the country. \"It is most beneficial in steeper catchments where rainfall is quickly funnelled into rivers that can result in high peaks in flows,\" its flood adviser Ian Moodie warned. \u201cThe measures are less likely to be beneficial within lowland areas such as the Somerset Levels where we\u2019ve seen a lot of flooding in recent years.\u201d Taking the pilot schemes into upland areas nationwide will not be easy. CIWEM say thousands of farms need to be visited and surveyed to see where micro-schemes can be placed to protect catchments \u2013 a tough demand when Defra and the Environment Agency are shedding staff. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson told the BBC he was \"passionate about keeping water in the uplands but details of how to do this need to be resolved\". CIWEM say the quickest results for back-to-nature drainage will come in areas where land is owned by a few people. For instance, near Pickering in Yorkshire, flood zones are being created and moorland drains stuffed with heather with the co-operation of just three large landowners including the Forestry Commission. It was the need for forestry and farm output which saw the UK\u2019s uplands drained in the first place when the farm department MAFF urged landowners to maximize productivity to overcome the U-boats during the Second World War. Nearly seven decades later there\u2019s still no concerted nationwide attempt to keep the rain on the uplands where it falls.

The Chelsea player said she also felt \"undermined and belittled\" by England staff and claims their negative bias contributed to her not being picked. But the FA said an independent report found no evidence of wrongdoing by Sampson or his staff. Aluko and the FA agreed a settlement earlier this year, with one national newspaper claiming it included a \u00a340,000 confidentiality agreement. BBC Sport understands the figure was higher. The FA said Aluko was not \"precluded from speaking about the facts of that complaint\" and that it agreed \"a mutual resolution\" to avoid disrupting the England squad's preparations for Euro 2017, which finished on Sunday. England were knocked out of the competition in the semi-finals by eventual winners the Netherlands. The case sheds light on the confusion surrounding Aluko's England career, which has stalled over the past year despite her being the Women's Super League One top scorer in 2016. Aluko, part of the England team that won the bronze medal at the 2015 World Cup, has 102 caps and has scored 33 international goals, but last played for her country in April 2016. She remains a centrally contracted player. A qualified lawyer, Aluko became the first female pundit to appear on Match of the Day and worked for Channel 4 in the same role during Euro 2017. Allegations made by her include accusations of staff calling her \"lazy\", Sampson belittling her in front of the squad and what she says are \"false claims\" by Sampson of \"bad behaviour\". In the complaint, Aluko said: \"It is inevitable that such damaging behaviour and bias from the ultimate leader of the group in the presence of my England team-mates will and has influenced other staff and team-mates to be empowered to also attempt to undermine and belittle. \"I submit that this is the basis of a culture of bullying and harassment.\" She added: \"Although I am well adjusted to the final decision of a manager, I submit that Mark Sampson's negative personal behaviour towards me has led to inconsistency, disparity of treatment and confusion regarding the criteria for team advancement.\" The FA commissioned an independent investigation conducted by a barrister, Katharine Newton, which started in December and concluded in March this year. Newton also wrote to Aluko to \"ensure complete transparency and objectivity of the findings\", the FA said. Sampson was appointed England manager in December 2013, replacing Hope Powell who had been in charge for 15 years.", "Matsuyama shot a six-under 66 in the last round of the WGC-HSBC Champions to finish seven clear of Sweden's Henrik Stenson and American Daniel Berger.

World number six Kei Nishikori brought the visitors level with a 6-3 7-5 7-6 (7-3) win over Dan Evans in Birmingham. Victory in the best-of-five first-round tie will secure a quarter-final place and World Group status in 2017. Dom Inglot and Jamie Murray are scheduled to take on Yoshihito Nishioka and Yasutaka Uchiyama in Saturday's doubles contest, although the line-ups can change up to an hour before the 14:00 GMT start time. \"We will wait and see,\" GB captain Leon Smith told BBC Sport. \"[It will be] hopefully our strongest team, put it that way.\" Britain are defending the title they regained last November for the first time in 79 years with victory against Belgium. \"It was amazing,\" Murray said of the reception he received after needing only 90 minutes to see off Daniel. Media playback is not supported on this device There were signs of rustiness - four double faults and 25 unforced errors slowing his progress at times - but the Scot broke serve six times and saved both break points he faced in a one-sided win. Murray, 28, won the opening 11 points in his first match since losing to Novak Djokovic in the Australian Open final 33 days ago. He wrapped up the first set in 28 minutes and took hold of a more competitive second after a double fault at 3-3 from Daniel, the US-born 23-year-old with just five ATP wins to his name. Two blistering returns gave Murray the decisive break at the start of the third and he wrapped up the 28th Davis Cup singles win of his career in style. \"The last few weeks have been the best of my life, really special,\" Murray said of becoming a father to Sophia. \"It has been tough the last few days being away from her for the first time but it had to happen to some stage, and it is a pleasure to represent my country and be with team-mates that we won with last year. \"The second set was tough - a lot of close games and some tough points, which was good for me. \"I was getting a little out of breath but I played a good match, served well, missed a few second serves but the first serve went extremely well, so it was a nice start.\" Evans, from Solihull, had the support of his home crowd and the confidence from a victory in his only previous meeting with Nishikori, but the Japanese player was still too strong. It is over three years since he surprisingly lost to Evans at the US Open and Nishikori has since become established among the game's elite. Evans, 25, once again played above his ranking of 157 but could only convert four of 13 break points that came his way. After dropping serve twice in the first set he failed to capitalise on 0-40 early on in what proved to be a tight second. Both players missed break point chances and a tie-break loomed with the Briton serving at 6-5, but after saving two set points he then netted a volley and double faulted. With both men apparently tiring, the third set saw a rash of service breaks - six in eight games - with Evans unable to build on leads at 3-2 and 4-3. Nishikori, 26, was similarly vulnerable on his own serve but got himself across the line in the tie-break after two hours and 44 minutes. Andy Murray slipped fairly seamlessly back into the day job, but Kei Nishikori had to absorb a lot of pressure from Dan Evans to make sure the tie is level heading into Saturday's doubles. But who will play? Murray told me he \"would love to play if it's the best thing for the team,\" as long as his body feels fine in the morning. But will Nishikori be on the other side of the court? It is looking likely - even though he has only ever played two Davis Cup doubles matches for Japan. \"He missed a few balls and looked a bit rusty but overall you've got to give Andy a 9/10. He just wanted to feel the ball out there but he looked sharp, and will be looking forward to the big match against Nishikori on Sunday. \"Nishikori got very nervous against Evans for a while there, but in the end the class player came through and upped his game.\" Friday Andy Murray beats Taro Daniel 6-1 6-3 6-1 Kei Nishikori beats Dan Evans 6-3 7-5 7-6 (7-3) Saturday doubles Dominic Inglot & Jamie Murray v Yoshihito Nishioka & Yasutaka Uchiyama Sunday Andy Murray v Kei Nishikori Dan Evans v Taro Daniel Listen to State of the British Game - a 5 live sport special", "Mr Johnson, the Mayor of London, announced on Sunday that he would be backing the campaign for Britain to leave the EU. His intervention in the debate - made, as he termed it, with \"deafening eclat\" - was even said to have helped cause the pound to slide on the international money markets as traders thought it made the possibility of a so-called Brexit more likely. He has arguably the highest profile of any of the governing Conservative Party except the Prime Minister David Cameron, but those outside the UK may be wondering: who is he, and is that actually his hair? Read on. Profile: Boris Johnson How could 'zip wire prat' become prime minister? Read more about the UK's referendum on the EU Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson, to give him his full name, was born in New York and is descended from Turkish, French and German stock. He describes himself as a \"one-man melting pot\". He first made a name for himself in journalism, including a stint as Brussels correspondent for the right-wing Daily Telegraph newspaper and editor of The Spectator magazine. His humorous persona led him to become a fixture on various television programmes, including the satirical BBC panel show Have I Got News For You. He still has a lucrative and entertaining column in the Daily Telegraph, in which august forum he explained the reasons for his decision on the EU. As a politician, he has been a Conservative member of parliament for two constituencies, Henley from 2001 to 2008 and then Uxbridge and South Ruislip from 2015. Lest you think he was putting his feet up between parliamentary mandates, he is also currently serving the second of two terms as mayor of London, no mean feat in a city where the centre-left Labour Party has dominated in recent decades. That's indicative of the position Mr Johnson has carved out for himself as one of the most charismatic politicians in the UK who has wide appeal beyond Conservative heartlands - polling has suggested that his stance on the EU referendum may sway some undecided voters. Just look what happens when you type his name into Google.co.uk. Not quite. He has previously courted controversy for his remarks about (among others) the populations of Liverpool, Portsmouth and Papua New Guinea, not to mention run-ins with his own party leadership and TV chef Jamie Oliver. Last October he accidentally flattened a 10-year-old schoolboy at what was meant to be a friendly game of photo-op rugby in Japan. But none of this seems to have affected his standing among the party faithful or the public at large. Even getting stuck on a zip-wire during the London Olympics in 2012, a sure-fire route to derision for any other politician, only enhanced his eccentric image. Mr Johnson finally ended months of speculation about which side of the EU debate he would back in an immaculately impromptu media scrum outside his home in North London, having reportedly informed the prime minister of his decision earlier the same day. He said that he had come to his decision as a result of deeply held convictions and \"after a huge amount of heartache\". His father Stanley, a former Conservative member of the European parliament, said that his son had performed a noble and potentially \"career-ending move\", ruining any chance of serving in Mr Cameron's cabinet. But Mr Cameron has already said he won't run for another mandate when his current one ends in 2020. Some observers of British politics point out that even if the UK votes to remain in the EU, positioning himself in the \"Out\" camp won't do Mr Johnson any harm with grassroots Conservatives, many of who are Eurosceptic and will have the final say in choosing a new leader. In this, some suggest, he is implementing his long-standing policy on cake: \"My policy on cake is pro having it and pro eating it.\" No, that's Donald Trump. Also a pioneer of unorthodox political hair, but they don't get on. When Mr Trump commented that parts of London are \"so radicalised the police are afraid for their lives\", Mr Johnson retorted: \"The only reason I wouldn't go to some parts of New York is the real risk of meeting Donald Trump.\" No, I've confused you now by mentioning Donald Trump. Same hair though. No, that's Julian Assange.", "The huts, made of chalk and straw daub and wheat-thatched roofing, have been based on archaeological remains found at Durrington Walls, near Stonehenge. Project leader Luke Winter said: \"What we're trying to do is get a sense of what these buildings looked like above-ground.\" The hope is to re-build the huts at Stonehenge visitor centre next year. \"What makes the buildings interesting is that they were dated to about the same time as the large sarsen stones were being erected at Stonehenge,\" Mr Winter said. \"One of the theories is that these may have housed the people that were helping with construction of that monument.\" Inside, the project team has used a variety of different daubs, made of pig soil [dung] or chalk and straw and construction techniques that would have been used by  Neolithic people. \"We've been trying a completely different way of thatching a roof.

But the BBC has said only one animal was chased by the snakes - with other iguanas only filmed for close-ups. The scene quickly went viral when it was aired last year and later won a Bafta for must-see moment. The iguana hatchling, filmed in the Galapagos, eventually got away - much to viewers' relief. The Daily Mail claimed the episode was embroiled in a \"fakery row\" after producer Elizabeth White told the Media Production Show: \"It wasn't the same iguana, no, and often we have to augment it with other clips. \"Unfortunately lizards, snakes and iguanas aren't good at 'takes'.\" But the BBC defended the Sir David Attenborough-fronted programme, with a spokeswoman saying: \"The BBC strongly refutes any suggestion that the award-winning iguana v snakes sequence was 'faked'. \"The final iguana chase in which one iguana escapes the snakes was - unusually for natural history filming - shot using two cameras, allowing us to follow both the individual iguana and the snakes' point of view. \"What was captured in the field was extraordinary animal behaviour which had never been witnessed or filmed before.\" She added: \"As is common in natural history film-making, pick-up shots were filmed separately - for example close-ups of iguana eyes - to make the story of the sequence as clear as possible for the audience. \"This is absolutely in keeping with the norms of natural history film-making - and absolutely in line with the BBC's editorial policy guidelines, and was a true representation of animal behaviour.\" Other BBC nature documentaries have previously been accused of faking footage. Frozen Planet, also fronted by Sir David, showed footage of newborn polar bear cubs in a den with their mother in 2011 - but it was filmed in an animal park, rather than in the wild. The BBC denied misleading viewers, with Sir David saying it would have spoiled the atmosphere to point out where the filming had taken place adding: \"It's not a falsehood and we don't keep it secret either\". And then there was the Blue Planet footage shot in a lobster tank - but the BBC said this was done to protect the environment.

Mr Glen said a tunnel was the only \"realistic solution\". A government feasibility study is already under way to consider the various options for the road. Speaking in a Westminster debate, Mr Glen said the road, which runs from Hampshire to Devon, had become the \"devil's highway\" and \"one of the most notorious traffic blackspots in the country\". He joined other South West MPs calling for the government to consider the wider economic, environmental and safety benefits of improving the road. However, he cautioned that any plans to turn part, or all, of the 92 mile (148km) road into a dual carriageway must include protection for Stonehenge. Mr Glen said he had been told by English Heritage, the National Trust and the Council for British Archaeology that Stonehenge would be \"formally placed on the at-risk register,\" if a dual carriageway was constructed close to the historic site without adequate protection. Plans for a tunnel were initially shelved in 2007 when the government said the estimated cost of \u00c2\u00a3510m was too expensive. \"A poorly designed and badly executed\" dual carriageway which could \"undermine a 5,000 year old world heritage site is not an improvement worth fighting for,\" Mr Glen said.

It was discovered following the earlier arrest of a 43-year-old man on suspicion of murder. Ms Cherry has not been seen since October 2015. Det Ch Insp Terry Crompton said: \"We are continuing to support Victoria's family as they deal with this devastating news. \"The arrested man remains in custody, but I'm urging anyone with any information that would help our enquiries to get in touch. \"If you have information about Victoria's whereabouts since her disappearance in 2015, or if you hold any information about the events leading up to our discovery, please contact us as a matter of urgency.\"", "Police say the individuals were using software designed to remotely control computers - allowing for the stealing of information. The other arrests were made in Estonia, France, Romania, Latvia, Italy, and Norway. The practice, which in some instances can grant access to a victim's webcam, is known as \"Ratting\". The phrase takes its name from the malicious software used to gain control - Remote Access Trojans (Rats). Using Rats to view people through their own webcams, without their knowledge, is becoming \"increasingly common\" according to the UK government-backed Get Safe Online advice website. The National Crime Agency (NCA) said it arrested two 33-year-old men, and a 30-year-old woman, in Leeds. A 20-year-old man was arrested in Chatham, Kent, while a 19-year-old man had his home searched in Liverpool and was brought in for \"voluntary questioning\". They are all accused of knowingly using Rats to spy on multiple targets. \"Victims are typically infected by being convinced to click on a link purporting to be a picture or video, or disguised as a legitimate file, but is instead an installer for the Rat,\" the NCA explained in a statement. \"In many cases, those who unwittingly install such trojans will have no indication that their machine is infected.\" Source: ChildNet International and Ceop As well as the arrests, the NCA said it was warning other users that the software was illegal, and its use would result in further action. \"The illegal use of Remote Access Trojans is a significant cybercrime threat, demanding this kind of strong, co-ordinated response from international to local UK level,\" said Andy Archibald, deputy director of the NCA's National Cyber Crime Unit. \"Suspected users of Rats are continuing to find that, despite having no physical contact or interaction with their victims, they can still be identified, tracked down and arrested by the NCA and its partners.\" An investigation by BBC Radio 5 live in June last year looked into the growing problem of Ratting. One victim, student Rachel Hyndman, told the station: \"I was sitting in the bath, trying to relax, and suddenly someone potentially has access to me in this incredibly private moment and it's horrifying. \"To have it happen to you without your consent is horribly violating.\" The investigation uncovered websites where hackers share pictures and videos of their victims.

Mr Swinney told the local government and regeneration committee he did not underestimate the \"on-going challenges\". However, he believed councils had been given a \"very credible settlement\". I think some of the talk has been frankly over the top about the impact of the settlement for local government. The minister said that in 2016/17, local authority spending would be cut by \u00a3350m, which equates to a 2% reduction. Mr Swinney insisted that headline figure was not the full story. He explained to MSPs: \"When we take into account that \u00a3250m is going to be spent through the integrated joint boards to support expenditure on services which local authorities are key participants, and given the guidance that I have issued to local authorities as to what they can expect that fund to support, that result is a net reduction in the local authority budget of about \u00a3100m, out of \u00a316bn, which equates to less than 1%.\" For the last seven years local authorities have carried out a deal with the Scottish government whereby council tax bills have remained frozen. However, this year Moray Council considered a move to increase council tax bills by 18% to ease the cuts burden. It decided not to go ahead with the plan because it would have resulted in the Scottish government withholding \u00a31.1m to offset the freeze. Council leader Stewart Cree said: \"We simply cannot proceed with the proposal as the extra penalties it would now attract would have a devastating effect on the services people in Moray tell us they want protected. \"So to make ends meet this year the administration have decided to defer certain works and spending, and to draw the remaining shortfall from reserves.\" Responding to a question about Moray Council's proposal to drop the tax freeze, Mr Swinney said: \"I think some of the talk we have heard has been frankly over the top about the impact of the settlement on local government. \"I don't underestimate the on-going challenges in delivering public services within a constrained financial environment.\" He added: \"In all, I think the settlement offered to local government is a very credible settlement, it certainly doesn't merit the type of description it has had from certain voices within local authorities and it most definitely does not merit an 18% increase in the council tax.\" Separately, Scotland's first minister has called on councils to \"do the right thing\" and accept the funding deal being offered by the Scottish government. Nicola Sturgeon insisted local authorities were being given a \"good deal\" as part of the budget, with a package containing resources that will help them pay the living wage to care workers. She made the plea as the 9 February deadline loomed for local authorities to sign up to the financial package.", "Richard Walsh, 43, was accused of attacking the two schoolboys, aged 12 and 13, in Havant, last month.

Emergency work has been undertaken but the cracked bridge between Linton and Collingham remains at risk of collapse, said Leeds City Council. Work, which will cost \u00a34.5m, is to start in July to put in place a river platform to work on the foundations. Parts of the bridge dropped about 8in (20cm) after the floodwater undermined its foundations. It has been shut since 27 December and the permanent repair works are expected to be completed by the summer of 2017. More than 100 bridges were damaged by floods in West Yorkshire and a bridge partially collapsed in Tadcaster in North Yorkshire. Councillor Richard Lewis said: \"I think everyone now realises the challenge of repairing Linton Bridge is considerable and requires detailed and complex work, so is not something that can be done quickly.\" The meeting also decided not to put a temporary footbridge in place due to cost and environmental impact. A free shuttle bus service has been operating between Linton and Wetherby since January.", "Scientists found that even the lowest expected levels of warming could decimate populations. However the researchers found that restoring connections between butterfly habitats could help modify the worst impacts. The research has been published in the journal Nature Climate Change. Although many people believe that butterflies are creatures that love the warmth, periods of extremely hot and dry weather can significantly reduce populations. In this study, British researchers looked at the impact of an extreme drought event in 1995 on butterfly species. This was the most arid summer since records began in 1776. They identified six species, including the Cabbage White and the Speckled Wood butterflies, that were particularly sensitive to heat. They then looked at what might happen to these creatures under different levels of warming up to 2100. If emissions of carbon dioxide continue on a \"business as usual\" model,  and warming is more extreme, then extinctions of some of these species could begin in England as early as 2050. \"We looked at the extent to which populations crashed from the drought and how long it takes them to recover,\" said lead author Dr Tom Oliver from Nerc Centre for Ecology and Hydrology. \"What we're asking is, as droughts become more frequent whether the return time of the drought was more frequent than the recovery of the butterflies.\" \"And when that was the case you'd get this gradual population erosion and in those places you'd get local extinctions.\" The researchers say that areas of the south east of England would be worst affected. However they argue that under less extreme warming conditions, changes to butterfly habitats could ameliorate the worst impacts. The team found that restoring connections between habitats that have been fragmented by human activities such as agriculture, was capable of making a big difference. Under a low emissions scenario, bridging these connections could improve the probability of butterfly survival by 50%. \"If our habitats are very fragmented,  the impacts will be much more severe. In places where it isn't those populations might persist,\" said Dr Oliver. \"It allows us to buy time until we get those global emission cuts in place.\" The researchers believe their study is a conservative estimation of how warming might impact these fragile species. They are concerned that, because of landscape changes in the UK throughout the 20th century, populations of some of the threatened species might be too low for them to recover from frequent droughts. The authors say that even people who are not impressed by the aesthetic appeal of butterflies should still be concerned about their demise. \"Butterflies are important culturally as part of our natural heritage, but there are other functions that could be impacted by their extinction including pollution, pest control and decomposition of waste,\" said Dr Oliver. \"Those un-swayed by the beauty and importance of having butterflies in the countryside ought to be concerned about the disruption to these functions provided by these species.\" Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc.", "In an interview for June's edition of Empire magazine, Moore recalled his early meetings with 007 film director Guy Hamilton. Moore said that while he would be playing the same character they wanted to avoid \"any deliberate\" comparisons. The interview, one of a series in Empire on Bond, came ahead of new Bond film Skyfall. Starring Daniel Craig as 007 and directed by Oscar-winner Sam Mendes, the latest movie in the franchise will be released in October. Scenes have been shot in London, Turkey and the White Corries in Glencoe. The filming in the Highlands in February reportedly involved a car chase featuring Aston Martin DB5s - the same car driven by Connery in Goldfinger and Thunderball. Talking about his early discussions with Hamilton about taking over from Scottish actor Connery, Moore said: \"We talked about my approach to the character. \"The thing he wanted to avoid was any deliberate comparison to Sean, apart from the fact I was playing the same character. \"So I was never saying 'Martini, shaken not stirred'.\" In her interview with Empire, producer Barbara Broccoli recalls how Connery exploded the traditional image of a movie's leading man. Ian Fleming's books about the secret agent were adapted for film by Broccoli's father Cubby Broccoli and Harry Saltzman. She said: \"The typical British leading man used to be Trevor Howard or Leslie Howard - very polite and your classic gentleman. \"I think the real genius of Cubby and Harry was the fact that they didn't pay any attention to the typical class structure and they took someone who was a very real person and put him into this suit.\" The magazine tells of \"unsung hero\" Yat Malmgren, a Swedish dance teacher to whom Connery turned to help hone his movement and gestures. It also tells of Dr No scriptwriter Terence Young introducing Connery to his Savile Row tailors and then telling the actor to sleep in the suits. Empire said the idea was to give the character the look of a man who had an eye for finery, but was more caught up in \"life and death than ironing shirts\".", "Yes - and no. According to Glastonbury organisers, it's the first time sustainable, recycled stainless steel pint cups have been used on such a major scale, so it's nice to be able to be one of the first people to get their mitts on one. However, they don't have a logo or any other identifying \"Glastonbury\" mark, so you'd have to be happy in the knowledge that only you and fellow-revellers know the significance of the beaker. Maybe in future years there will be an identifying stamp - and full-on collecting will be possible. If that's the case, having one of the first ones could be invaluable. Good news for people with metallaphobia - they're not compulsory. In fact, they're only available at 10 of the main bars - overall there are hundreds of food and drink stands. It depends what you plan to do with them. If you want to partake in the unpleasant age-old festival tradition of urinating into cups and hurling them at the band, you'll find that although strong, they're difficult to throw very far. They don't have lids, and are an awkward and non-aerodynamic shape to throw, with the contents likely to leave the vessel well before reaching your intended target. The real danger comes from full bottles with the top still on. A litre bottle of water weighs 1kg (about 2.25lb), and hurled at a head can pack a powerful punch. That's why so many venues insist on removing the plastic cap when selling bottles of liquid. Baby-faced pop phenomenon Justin Bieber, sensitive northern warbler Morrissey, and ladies' boy Harry Styles have all faced missiles filled by micturating merrymakers. Of course, for people stumbling back to their tents, treading on a discarded metal cup is more likely to lead to a sprained ankle than mashing a plastic or paper one. But the \u00a35 deposit might encourage people hang on to them. It shouldn't do. The cups are made from food grade stainless steel. According to beer appreciation group Beer Advocate, stainless steel is fine - after all, beer kegs are made from the same material. The metals to avoid are copper - which can react with the brew, and pewter - which can affect the taste. Also, antique pewter goblets tend to contain lead, which is poisonous. People with amalgam fillings should have no trouble with drinking from stainless steel cups, says the British Dental Association. Not on its own - although it's a nice nod towards that. But Glastonbury organiser Michael Eavis has high hopes his idea will get the ball rolling. \"For me, the single most important thing was being able to source British stainless steel for the cups from the place where it was invented - Sheffield, and then to take it on to the home of manufacture - Birmingham,\" he says. \"If the jobs, skills and infrastructure [in British steel] are lost they won't be replaced. We've worked on this project over the last three years, which will hopefully encourage other UK businesses to think about how they can support our steel industry during these very challenging times.\" Remember though, the Glastonbury cups are made from 80% recycled steel. One of the high-profile troubled steel works is at Port Talbot in south Wales, which produces slab, hot rolled, cold rolled and galvanised coil. Which is new steel. The festival's green initiatives and sustainability coordinator Lucy Smith says: \"For us, using these cups is part of the reusable revolution. It's very similar to paying 5p for a carrier bag. We think people will take to it. \"The pints are made by APS in Birmingham, and it was a significant part of the project to have them made with British stainless steel.\" Steelwork does produce pollutants - Tata Steel says particulate material, sulphur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen are emissions the company monitors. But the production of plastic glasses also releases toxins including trichloroethane, acetone, methylene chloride and benzene. Plus - plastics are very stable and therefore stay in the environment a long time after they are thrown away, especially if they are shielded from direct sunlight by being buried in landfills.", "A plant that typically colonised volcanoes in Japan was imported to Britain to help hide, or possibly even stabilise, railway embankments. Since then its spread has caused much unhappiness amongst home-owners and prospective house purchasers. It can crack tarmac, block drains, undermine foundations and invade homes. Its presence can be enough to cut a property's value by up to 20%, or prevent a mortgage lender approving a loan. But just as new technology created the problem originally, new technology may help to solve it. Five years ago, the Environment Agency commissioned a new app to track Japanese knotweed, using the crowd-sourcing principle. More than 20,000 people have now downloaded it, and their data has pin-pointed over 6,000 knotweed locations. Click here to view full UK map, and then zoom in to your area \"If we can get more people taking an interest and submitting records, so much the better,\" says Dave Kilbey, director of Natural Apptitude, which designed and launched the app. \"Hopefully it will mean people will become a bit more aware of the problems, and what to look for.\" So far the results show a particular concentration of knotweed in South Wales, the Midlands, London, Scotland's central belt and Cornwall - where the plant was also introduced by Victorians into ornamental gardens. Those looking for a property can use the app to find out if knotweed has been found nearby - but the fact it is not on the map does not mean it is not present; it is simply that no one has reported it. The data provided by the PlantTracker app is also added to the National Biodiversity Network (NBN) atlas, which aims to track the whereabouts of all the UK's plants and animals, from bee orchids to goshawks. Even though it has only been available to the public since April, and is not yet fully functional, the atlas has further information about Japanese knotweed locations. The map shows more than 43,000 historical records for the plant, going back to 1900. But Purba Choudhury, communications officer for the NBN, says that if there are no records in your area, that doesn't guarantee its absence. \"Conversely, the record you are seeing might be an old record, and the Japanese knotweed might have been removed since the record was uploaded,\" she says. Click here to view full NBN map of the UK, then zoom in to your area The South Wales section of the NBN map (above) shows how knotweed spreads along the course of rivers and canals. In such locations tiny fragments of knotweed float downstream, and quickly establish themselves elsewhere. Trying to destroy Japanese knotweed by yourself is virtually impossible. That is because the roots, or rhizomes, spread rapidly underground, and can regenerate from tiny amounts of material. In fact it can grow at the rate of 10cm a day during the summer. \"Digging it out of the ground can just spread it terribly,\" warns Stephen Hodgson, the chief executive of the Property Care Association (PCA). \"If you've got it in your garden, either leave it alone, or treat it properly.\" The advice is as follows: In an experiment being conducted in South Wales, thousands of plant lice were released last summer, in the hopes that they would help destroy some of the knotweed along river banks. But otherwise the accepted best-practice treatment is for professionals to inject the plant with industrial-strength weed killer glyphosate. David Layland, the joint managing director of Japanese Knotweed Control, based in Stockport, says it is the only thing that works. \"Once we inject into it, it transfers into the root system pretty quickly, and then it binds with the roots. Over time, it rots away into the subsoil.\" But professional treatment is costly, starting at about \u00c2\u00a32,500, and going upwards to \u00c2\u00a330,000 for a major infestation. Just as big a worry for many home-owners is the discovery that your neighbour has Japanese knotweed on his or her property, and refuses to do anything about it. But under the 2014 Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act, local councils or police forces can now issue a Community Protection Notice (CPN), forcing neighbours to take action, and fining them if they don't. \"I think when they are enforced - and they are starting to be enforced - CPNs are very effective,\" says Stephen Hodgson. \"But they are, and should be, a measure of last resort.\" In the meantime judges at the Court of Appeal are gearing up to provide an important precedent on who should pay if a landowner allows knotweed to encroach on somebody else's property. Next year they will rule on the case of Williams v Network Rail - after two homeowners in South Wales were awarded \u00c2\u00a315,000 to compensate them for knotweed which had spread into their gardens.", "Several thousand people filed through Independence Square, still full of barricades and memorials to more than 80 people killed last month by snipers. And the government announced plans to recruit 10,000 people within the next 15 days for its new National Guard. \"People will have the opportunity to defend the country,\" interim Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk told a cabinet meeting. He also promised that \"separatist ringleaders\" who were trying to destroy Ukrainian independence would be held to account. \"We will find all of them\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and bring them to justice and try them in Ukrainian and international courts,\" he said. \"The ground will burn beneath their feet.\" Wording of ballot paper Law and order breakdown Is Russian intervention legal? But the truth is that there is little that the authorities here can do without significant outside help. Just as they are watching closely for the next move from Moscow, so they are expecting action from their Western allies. And the drumbeat of diplomacy has certainly not faded. Both the United States and the European Union have made it clear again that the referendum in Crimea is \"illegal and illegitimate and its outcome will not be recognised.\" When EU foreign ministers meet in Brussels on Monday, they are expected to extend sanctions against Russia - including asset freezes and travel bans against named individuals. UK Foreign Secretary William Hague said Russia must now face \"economic and political consequences\". But there are still different opinions within Europe about how wide-ranging the list of names should be. One possibility is that an announcement in Brussels on Monday will focus on officials in Crimea itself, with the threat of imposing similar measures against senior figures in Moscow held in reserve. Many Western diplomats are waiting to see exactly how Russia will respond to the result of the referendum. The Russian parliament is due to consider the proposal for Crimea to rejoin Russia on 21 March. But for anyone looking for compromise, the signs aren't good. President Vladimir Putin told the German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Sunday that Russia would respect the choice of the residents of Crimea. And he expressed concern about the escalation of tension in eastern Ukraine by \"radical groups with the connivance of the authorities in Kiev\". US Secretary of State John Kerry spoke by phone with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, as voting in Crimea was under way. A senior State Department official said Mr Kerry told Mr Lavrov that the crisis in Crimea could only be resolved politically, through reform of the Ukrainian constitution. But while Western officials have not given up on diplomacy, there are few illusions about Moscow's position. And if President Putin chose to move Russian forces into parts of eastern Ukraine, under whatever pretext, this crisis would move into a new and far more dangerous phase. For now, the government in Kiev can only watch and wait, and hope that Western promises of massive financial assistance materialise soon. There is a feeling here that as well as threatening Ukraine's security and territorial integrity, Russia wants to undermine the viability of the new government, and bring this country close to collapse. The real issue for Moscow may not be Crimea. It may be the long-term example that a westward-leaning democratic Ukraine could set in Russia itself.", "Christopher Huxtable, 34, from Swansea, had been missing since the collapse in February. His body was found on Wednesday and workers who carried out the search formed a guard of honour as it was driven from the site in the early hours of the morning. Ken Cresswell, 57, and John Shaw, 61, both from Rotherham, remain missing. The body of a fourth man, Michael Collings, 53, from Brotton, Teesside, was previously recovered from the site. Swansea East MP Carolyn Harris, who has been involved with the family since the incident, said they still did not know all the facts about the collapse. She said: \"I feel very sad. My heart and my prayers go out to the family who have waited desperately for Christopher's body to be found. They can finally have closure, and say goodbye to him and grieve his loss. \"But let's not forget that there's two other families who are still waiting for their loved ones to be returned.\" The building was due for demolition when it partially collapsed in February.", "Dwindling domestic gas and coal supplies mean the nation would become dependent on volatile imports, it adds. The report, by Cambridge Econometrics for RenewableUK, said wind power saved the UK \u00c2\u00a3579 million in fossil fuel costs in 2013. The UK is recognised for having the best wind resource in Europe. \"One of the main messages from this report is that in a scenario with a higher content of wind energy, you are less reliant on fossil fuels,\" explained co-author Sophie Billington, a researcher from Cambridge Econometrics. \"This is a key message, particularly when you consider that the UK - for the past five years or so - has imported more gas than it has produced domestically.\" She told BBC News that under a high gas scenario (gas power plants replacing end-of-life coal and nuclear plants) and a 40% increase in gas prices by 30%, electricity prices would increase by 8%. However, under a high wind scenario (wind farms replacing end-of-life coal and nuclear plants), electricity prices would still rise but by only 4%. \"For the wind scenario, you have higher upfront capital costs but fewer uncertain variable costs, leading to more price resilience,\" Ms Billington added. The report said that the UK electricity sector had undergone a substantial change in recent decades, shifting from a coal-based system to a more balanced mix \"encompassing nuclear and gas-fired power stations, as well as emerging renewable energy technologies\". It observed: \"Over the next 10 to 20 years, the energy sector will need to be re-shaped again if the UK's targets to reduce CO2 emissions are to be met.\" In 2008, the UK established the world's first legally binding climate change target, requiring governments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80% from 1990 levels by 2050. Rob Norris, RenewableUK's head of communications, said that currently there were \"not enough renewables in the system to meet those targets\". He told BBC News: \"The crucial thing is that energy policy is a long-term game and at the moment we only really know what the government support will be out to 2020. \"What you really need is a long-term vision out to 2030 so then you can plan, especially when it comes to things like large offshore developments.\" Mr Norris said he advocated a \"rich energy mix so then you do not put all your eggs in one basket\". He added: \"If you have different technologies, including renewables, competing against each other then the cost is driven down for the consumer.\"", "The fares freeze was a significant promise made by Mr Khan during this year's mayoral election race. The mayor said the fares freeze would save the average household \u00a3200 over the next four years. The freeze is expected to cost \u00a3640m. It will not apply to travelcards, monthly Oyster cards or daily caps. They can be used on services provided by other operators. During the mayoral election campaign Mr Khan promised Londoners \"won't pay a penny more for their travel in 2020 than they do today\". Bus and tram tickets, Pay As You Go journeys on the Tube, Docklands Light Railway and TfL rail services will all be frozen. Bike hire charges will also not rise before 2020. But TfL will have to make cuts of at least \u00a3591m by 2018, the point at which it will lose its government operational grant. The fares freeze is likely to mean further cuts to TfL's budget as it seeks to absorb the cost. The mayor has undertaken a review of TfL's layers of management, promised to cut agency staff, review projects and freeze salaries of top managers to make savings. He also repeated his call for the government to follow his lead and freeze fares on rail routes into the capital, including services run by troubled Southern Railway. Mr Khan said: \"After years of huge fare increases for London passengers, I'm delighted to be formally announcing our plans to freeze TfL fares across London's transport network. \"Before taking office I was determined to ensure we took significant action to make public transport more affordable and we've already taken major steps through the introduction of the Hopper ticket that in just two months has saved Londoners money on over 10 million bus journeys.\"", "The 31-year-old, who left Ospreys to join French Top 14 side Perpignan in 2011, has agreed a three-year contract. \"It's good for me personally as a rugby player and it's the right thing for my family to be coming home,\" said Hook. \"It's important I finish well at Gloucester. It's a great club and they've been really good to me.\" Hook, who has 81 caps for Wales, began his career with Neath before spending five years with Ospreys, and helped them to the 2010 Celtic League title. He made 68 appearances for Perpignan in a three-year spell and, after Ospreys tried to re-sign him, joined Gloucester in 2014, having activated a get-out clause in his contract when the French club were relegated from the Top 14. \"It's been fantastic to go away to new places, get some unbelievable experiences in England and France with two great clubs, but I'm coming home to a team that's going places,\" Hook continued. \"I'm only 31, I'm playing week in, week out with Gloucester and I think I've got plenty to give on the field for a few years to come.\" Hook's return to Ospreys comes after fly-half Sam Davies and back-row forwards Justin Tipuric, Dan Baker and Dan Lydiate all signed new deals with the region.", "The disease is caused by the immune system destroying the cells that control blood sugar levels. A team at Harvard University used stem cells to produce hundreds of millions of the cells in the laboratory. Tests on mice showed the cells could treat the disease, which experts described as \"potentially a major medical breakthrough\". Beta cells in the pancreas pump out insulin to bring down blood sugar levels. But the body's own immune system can turn against the beta cells, destroying them and leaving people with a potentially fatal disease because they cannot regulate their blood sugar levels. It is different to the far more common type 2 diabetes which is largely due to an unhealthy lifestyle. The team at Harvard was led by Prof Doug Melton who began the search for a cure when his son was diagnosed 23 years ago. He then had a daughter who also developed type 1. He is attempting to replace the approximately 150 million missing beta cells, using stem cell technology. He found the perfect cocktail of chemicals to transform embryonic stem cells into functioning beta cells. Tests on mice with type 1 diabetes, published in the journal Cell, showed that the lab-made cells could produce insulin and control blood sugar levels for several months. Dr Melton said: \"It was gratifying to know that we could do something that we always thought was possible. \"We are now just one pre-clinical step away from the finish line.\" However, his children were not quite so impressed: \"I think, like all kids, they always assumed that if I said I'd do this, I'd do it.\" If the beta cells were injected into a person they would still face an immune assault and ultimately would be destroyed. More research is needed before this could become a cure. Sarah Johnson, from the charity JDRF which funded the study, told the BBC: \"This isn't a cure, it is a great move along the path. It is a tremendous step forward. \"Replacing the cells that produce insulin as well as turning off the immune response that causes type 1 diabetes is the long-term goal.\" Prof Chris Mason, a stem cell scientist at University College London, said: \"A scientific breakthrough is to make functional cells that cure a diabetic mouse, but a major medical breakthrough is to be able to manufacture at large enough scale the functional cells to treat all diabetics. \"This research is therefore a scientific and potentially a major medical breakthrough. \"If this scalable technology is proven to work in both the clinic and in the manufacturing facility, the impact on the treatment of diabetes will be a medical game-changer on a par with antibiotics and bacterial infections.\" Dr Gillian Morrison, from the University of Edinburgh, agreed that this \"represents a real advance in the field\". She said: \"The next important challenge will be to find ways to maintain these cells inside the body so they are protected from the immune response and have long-term function.\"", "Most incidents came during the Cold War, when the US and the Soviet Union battled for influence across the continent. CIA covert operations are by their very nature hard to prove definitively. But research into the agency's work, as well as revelations by former CIA employees, has thrown up several cases where the agency tried to influence events. Here are four examples: Patrice Lumumba became the first prime minister of the newly-independent Congo in 1960, but he lasted just a few months in the job before he was overthrown and assassinated in January 1961. In 2002, former colonial power Belgium admitted responsibility for its part in the killing, however, the US has never explained its role despite long-held suspicions. US President Dwight D Eisenhower, concerned about communism, was worried about Congo following a similar path to Cuba. According to a source quoted in Death in the Congo, a book about the assassination, President Eisenhower gave \"an order for the assassination of Lumumba. There was no discussion; the [National Security Council] meeting simply moved on\". However, a CIA plan to lace Lumumba's toothpaste with poison was never carried out, Lawrence Devlin, who was a station chief in Congo at the time, told the BBC in 2000. A survey of declassified US government documents from the era notes that the CIA \"initially focussed on removing Lumumba, not only through assassination if necessary but also with an array of non-lethal undertakings\". While there is no doubt the CIA wanted him dead, the survey does not indicate direct US involvement in his eventual killing. Ghana's first President Kwame Nkrumah was overthrown in a military coup in 1966 while he was out of the country. He later suspected that the US had a role in his downfall and in a 1978 book, former CIA intelligence officer John Stockwell backed this theory up. In In Search of Enemies he writes that an official sanction for the coup does not appear in CIA documents, but he writes \"the Accra station was nevertheless encouraged by headquarters to maintain contact with dissidents. \"It was given a generous budget, and maintained intimate contact with the plotters as a coup was hatched.\" He says that the CIA in Ghana got more involved and its operatives were given \"unofficial credit for the eventual coup\". A declassified US government document does show awareness of a plot to overthrow the president, but does not indicate any official backing. Another declassified document written after the coup describes Nkrumah's fall as a \"fortuitous windfall. Nkrumah was doing more to undermine our interests than any other black African\". In Angola three competing groups fought for control after independence from Portugal in 1975, with the MPLA under Agostinho Neto taking over the capital Luanda. Mr Stockwell, chief of CIA's covert operations in Angola in 1975, writes that Washington decided to oppose the MPLA, as it was seen as closer to the Soviet Union, and support the FNLA and Unita instead, even though all three had help from communist countries. The CIA then helped secretly import weapons, including 30,000 rifles, through Kinshasa in neighbouring Zaire, now known as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mr Stockwell says in a video documentary. He adds that CIA officers also trained fighters for armed combat. A declassified US government document detailing a discussion between the head of the CIA, the secretary of state and others indicates the support the CIA gave to the forces fighting the MPLA. The US continued to support Unita through much of the civil war as Cuba was backing the MPLA. Hissene Habre failed in his attempt to take power by force in Chad in 1980. But his efforts led President Goukouni Oueddei to call on help from the Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, whose soldiers successfully beat back Habre's challenge and forced him into exile. A proposed alliance between Libya and Chad began to unsettle the US especially as Gaddafi began to be seen as a supporter of anti-US activities. In Foreign Policy magazine Michael Bronner writes that the CIA director, with the secretary of state, \"coalesced around the idea of launching a covert war in partnership with Habre\". It is alleged that the US then backed Habre's overthrow of the president in 1982 and then supported him throughout his brutal rule.", "Head coach Warren Gatland is leading the British and Irish Lions in New Zealand and has named interim coach Rob Howley as part of his backroom team. Forwards coach McBryde assumes head coach responsibilities for the third time after leading Wales on tours in 2009 and 2013. \"It is an honour to represent your country and to do so overseas carries extra responsibility,\" said McBryde. \"For me it is another exciting opportunity to lead the team.  It is something I have thoroughly enjoyed in the past and I'm really looking forward to doing it again at the end of the season.\" The Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) will appoint assistant coaches for the summer tour to assist McBryde. \"We are also at an advanced stage in discussions with a number of other individuals about the summer tour and hope to be in a position to confirm the full make-up of the management team next week,\" said WRU chief executive Martyn Phillips. Union chairman Gareth Davies, who is also on the Lions' selection panel, believes the involvement of Welsh coaches will benefit the national team. \"2017 is a real summer of opportunity for Welsh coaches and should benefit the whole of Welsh rugby in the years ahead,\" he said. \"It is not often that you get the opportunity to develop coaches in different environments. \"Our coaches and players have been invigorated by their Lions experiences on previous campaigns and there is little doubt that a tour of New Zealand will provide the ultimate test and so once again both mentally stimulate and inspire each individual.\"", "\"It is with tremendous sadness that we announce the death of our beautiful, dynamic and one-of-a-kind mother,\" the statement said. The British-born writer, sister of actress Joan Collins, died in Los Angeles, her spokeswoman said. Collins's raunchy novels of the rich and famous sold more than 500 million copies in 40 countries. In a career spanning four decades, all 32 of her novels appeared in the New York Times bestseller list. The family statement said the writer lived \"a wonderfully full life\", adored by family, friends and readers. \"She was a true inspiration, a trailblazer for women in fiction and a creative force. She will live on through her characters but we already miss her beyond words,\" it added. Collins was diagnosed with stage-four breast cancer six-and-a-half years ago, according to US celebrity magazine People. She told the magazine in her last interview on 14 September that she had told few people about her diagnosis other than her three daughters, and did not regret her decision. \"I did it my way, as Frank Sinatra would say,\" she said. \"I've written five books since the diagnosis, I've lived my life, I've travelled all over the world, I have not turned down book tours and no-one has ever known until now when I feel as though I should come out with it.\" She was in the UK less than a fortnight ago on a promotional tour for her latest book. Her sister Joan, 82, who only learned the news herself in the last fortnight, told People magazine she was \"completely devastated\". \"She was my best friend. I admire how she handled this. She was a wonderful, brave and a beautiful person and I love her,\" she said. Jackie Collins, who was born in London, began writing as a teenager, making up racy stories for her schoolfriends, according to a biography on her website. Her first novel, The World is Full of Married Men, was published in 1968 and became a scandalous bestseller. It was banned in Australia and branded \"disgusting\" by romance writer Barbara Cartland. In 1985, her novel Hollywood Wives was made into a mini-series by ABC, starring Anthony Hopkins and Candice Bergen. Collins said that she \"never felt bashful writing about sex\". \"I think I've helped people's sex lives,\" she said. \"Sex is a driving force in the world so I don't think it's unusual that I write about sex. I try to make it erotic, too.\" Collins had lost her mother, second husband and fiance to cancer. She told the Press Association earlier this month that she had chosen to celebrate life rather than mourn those she had lost. \"I refuse to mourn people, because everybody dies,\" she said. \"Death and taxes, you can't avoid either\".

Power Without Pylons and Friends of the Lake District say the National Grid is \"ignoring\" demands for the cables to go underground in \"sensitive landscapes\". The National Grid said it \"fully recognises the importance\" of the area. The campaign walk is taking place from Black Combe where the pylons will be visible, down to the National Park's costal boundary and across the mouth of Duddon. Graham Pitts, chairman of Power Without Pylons, said: \"This is a very serious decision.

The government said allowing court action would not help training safety. But Kelvin and Margaret Roberts said they believed the army would be more responsible if they were legally accountable. In March, the Ministry of Defence was reprimanded over failures which led to the deaths of L/Cpl Roberts, from Penrhyn Bay, Conwy county, Cpl James Dunsby from Trowbridge, Wiltshire, and L/Cpl Edward Maher, of Winchester, Hampshire. At their inquest last year a coroner ruled neglect contributed to their deaths. The Health and Safety Executive issued a censure, which is the highest action it can take, as the MoD cannot be prosecuted. It has since apologised for the failings. But, responding to the Commons Defence Select Committee report 'Beyond Endurance?' which was published after the deaths of the SAS candidate reservists, the UK Government ruled out amending the 2007 Corporate Manslaughter Act. Mr and Mrs Roberts said: \"We are extremely disappointed that the government has decided not to accept the recommendation of the... committee to remove the immunity from prosecution from the MoD when served with a crown censure. \"The government states that they fail to see how losing the immunity would make improvements to the safety of military training, however, we believe that if the MoD are legally accountable for their actions then they will be more responsible and diligent in their training methods. \"We have done our best to have the immunity removed and bereaved families in the past have also tried, so we are pleased that the Defence Committee intend to pursue their interest in this matter with the MoD.\" The three men were on a selection march in Powys on one of the hottest days of 2013 when they fell ill. All three were on course to complete it within the allocated time but were found in three separate locations at different times. An inquest found they died after suffering the effects of hyperthermia - or overheating. Coroner Louise Hunt, who ruled the men died as a result of neglect, warned there was a risk of future deaths on SAS selection marches unless action was taken. The HSE investigation into the men's deaths found the MoD failed to plan, assess, and manage the risks associated with heat illness during the training. In its response to the 'Beyond Endurance?' report, the UK government said existing arrangements in respect of military training fatalities worked effectively as a means of ensuring lessons were learnt and mistakes were not repeated. It said: \"The MoD invariably implements any corrective measures identified by the HSE and treats crown censure as a matter of the utmost seriousness. \"It is not therefore clear how the proposed amendments to the act, which would only take effect once the MoD has been subject to a crown censure, would result in any tangible improvement to the safety of military training. \"These safeguards (to learn lessons, implement corrective measures identified by the HSE and the seriousness with which we treat crown censure), together with the ability to bring civil claims for negligence against the MoD, where a breach of a duty of care occurs within the UK or abroad, provide a strong system both for discouraging failure by the MoD and for learning lessons where things go wrong.\" It added the MoD would be the focus of any civil claim whether the breach was at the highest levels of the MoD or at the immediate level at which training was carried out and it would be \"extremely difficult, perhaps impossible to apply the concept of manslaughter to the role of the senior management of the MoD in permitting and setting parameters for training which is essential and which is by its nature hazardous\".", "Something Wicked this Way Comes, shown on a Sunday morning, featured the illusionist putting a plastic bag over his head and walking on broken glass. Broadcasting watchdog Ofcom said children could have imitated Brown's \"clearly dangerous behaviour\". It received five complaints about the show, which aired on UKTV's Watch channel on 6 December. UKTV said the programme was broadcast in error and was unsuitable for a pre-watershed transmission. In the 14-minute segment, Brown had sought to demonstrate a technique to limit pain and bleeding.   He placed a transparent bag over his head and sealed it while a member of the audience tapped out his pulse rate on a drum. Once his pulse rate had slowed to a stop, Brown - who appeared to be in a state of semi-consciousness - removed the bag from his head and walked barefoot on a path of broken glass. At the end of the sequence, the camera zoomed on his feet to show that they had not bled as a result of contact with the glass. Ofcom said: \"Plastic bags are a common household item that children frequently have access to without parental supervision. They also present a widely acknowledged risk of harm to young children. \"Therefore, Ofcom took the view that Derren Brown's use of a plastic bag to asphyxiate himself was likely to be easily imitable by children in a manner that was harmful. \"This was particularly because self-asphyxiation was presented as a way to carry out acts which would not normally be possible because of the bleeding and pain that resulted. \"Further in this programme no negative consequences of self-asphyxiation were identified.\" Ofcom also found that Brown's use of swear words during the segment breached the code on offensive language before the watershed. UKTV said an internal investigation had revealed that \"due to human error\" the programme was \"erroneously labelled\" as being suitable for broadcast before the watershed. It said it had implemented additional safeguards to prevent the same mistake happening again.", "Almost 80,000 passengers and crew have sailed into Belfast this year on 43 different tourist ships. One of the big draws is the new Titanic Visitor Centre, which so far has welcomed people from 111 different countries. Belfast is no longer building ships, but it is now attracting them. The peace process has transformed the city. During the 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s the cruise ship industry steered clear of Belfast. It was not until 1997 that modern luxury liners started sailing up Belfast Lough. In recent years, numbers have soared. Next year, more than 50 are expected. So what's the big attraction? The Giant's Causeway, golf and Titanic Belfast are pulling in the visitors. However, there is also a human factor - curiosity. Gerry Lennon, chief executive of the Belfast Visitor and Convention Bureau, said: \"Curiosity is a huge driver for tourism. A lot of people are curious about Belfast and Northern Ireland. \"The political stability has given us that ability to go to the market-place and now say 'look what we have to offer'.\" The Glens of Antrim, the walls of Londonderry and Belfast's shopping districts are also proving popular. The recent three nights of rioting in one part of north Belfast do not seem to have put people off. Money has been invested in Belfast Harbour to ensure it can cope with the increasingly large vessels sailing into the city, including the latest arrival, the 113,000-tons Emerald Princess. Tony McAuley, commercial officer for Belfast Harbour, said: \"Once we get people here, the facilities almost sell themselves.\" The Titanic Visitor Centre has attracted more than 500,000 visitors since it opened six months ago - double what was expected. The cruise ship business alone is worth an estimated \u00c2\u00a315m a year to Northern Ireland's economy. There is a certain novelty factor to Belfast at the moment. This will wear off in time. In the meantime, the city is enjoying riding the wave of international interest. Follow Mark Simpson on Twitter: @BBCMarkSimpson", "A new report from the Centre for Cities and the Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics, said all cities would see a fall in output due to increasing trade costs. Aberdeen and Edinburgh were both ranked among the ten most affected cities. However the study said both cities are also among the best-placed to respond to any predicted economic turbulence. The study excludes Belfast as the authors said data for Northern Ireland was not available. The UK government said it was committed to securing a \"bold and ambitious\" free trade deal and building on the diverse strengths of all the UK's cities and regions. Meanwhile, Scottish and Welsh government ministers have met in Cardiff to discuss Brexit legislation. Earlier in July, business advisers PwC said uncertainty about Brexit was having a negative impact on the Scottish economy and housing market. The London-based Centre for Cities think-tank said all UK cities faced \"significant economic challenges\" as the UK leaves the EU due to a predicted increase in trading costs. They produced predicted reductions in economic output for each of the country's cities, for both the scenario of a so-called \"soft\" Brexit - with the UK joining a free trade area such as the European Free Trade Area (EFTA) - or a \"hard\" Brexit, where the UK does not come to an immediate deal with the EU and defaults to World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules. The researchers said either scenario would result in an increase in non-tariff barriers, such as customs checks, border controls, differences in product market regulations and legal hurdles, all increasing the cost of trade. Under both models, the group predicted that local trade flows and employment shares meant Aberdeen would see the largest reduction in output, measured by gross value added, over the next ten years - of 3.7% under the \"hard\" Brexit scenario, or of 2.1% under a \"soft\" Brexit. Edinburgh was ranked sixth in the table in both models, with reductions of 2.7% and 1.4% respectively. Other cities which feature on the tables include London, Reading, Leeds and Swindon. However, the researchers said the factors which made the cities likely to suffer in the short term also made them well-placed to respond. They said the cities were \"home to large, highly-skilled labour markets, significant numbers of innovative firms and strong business networks - all of which are crucial in enabling a city to reinvent or adapt its industrial structure to changing economic circumstances\". Prof Stephen Machin from the Centre for Economic Performance said: \"The fact that the industrial specialisation and the skill and knowledge intensity of different places are key to local impact should be of significant importance to the design and implementation of policy, especially in the arenas of industrial, skills and labour market strategies.\" A UK government spokesman said: \"We are committed to a bold and ambitious free trade agreement that works for the whole of the UK. \"The government is engaging extensively with businesses and organisations across the country, and will continue this work throughout the exit process. \"Through the government's modern industrial strategy we will look to build on the diverse strengths of all of the UK's cities and regions.\" Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie contended that Brexit would have a \"significant negative impact\" regardless of the deal secured, saying the government \"cannot just wave these numbers away\". He said: \"People last year did not vote to make themselves poorer. The question on the ballot paper was not whether we wanted to destroy our economy and the prosperity of our cities. Giving the people a chance to exit from Brexit with a vote on the deal is the right and democratic thing to do.\" Scottish Labour said the report showed the importance protecting jobs and the economy as part of the Brexit deal. Shadow Scottish Secretary Lesley Laird said: \"There should be a jobs-first Brexit, to ensure that our cities such as Aberdeen and Edinburgh can continue to grow. Jobs, the economy and retaining the benefits of the single market and the customs union are our top priority.\" Meanwhile, Scottish and Welsh ministers have met in Cardiff to discuss the EU Withdrawal Bill, the legislation planned by the UK government to begin extricating the country from Europe's legal framework. Scottish Brexit minister Mike Russell and Lord Advocate James Wolffe sat down with Welsh Finance Secretary Mark Drakeford and Welsh government's top lawyer, Counsel General Mick Antoniw. The devolved administrations fear the legislation could see them lose powers over areas such as fishing and agriculture. The UK government denies this, and says the legislatures will actually gain powers as a result of Brexit.", "She plays a no-nonsense character in House of Cards, and in real life Robin Wright is no different. For four seasons, viewers have seen her in the role of Claire Underwood, the Machiavellian partner of stop-at-nothing politician, Frank Underwood, played by Kevin Spacey. Both actors have also directed and produced episodes of the show. But while their roles are equally prominent, for years their salaries were not in parity. \"I was like, 'I want to be paid the same as Kevin.' It was a perfect paradigm and example to use, because there are very few films or TV shows where the male\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe patriarch and the matriarch are equal. And they are in House of Cards,\" she told an audience at New York's Rockefeller Foundation. Wright looked at statistics which showed that for some time, her character was more popular than Spacey's. \"So I capitalised on it. I was like, 'You better pay me or I'm going to go public\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6and they did.'\" Wright's success at equalising her pay is a story to be noted, because it is still incredibly rare. \"She is playing a popular and important character in a series. She has leverage and she used it,\" says Lisa Maatz, vice president for government relations at the American Association of University Women (AAUW), which has conducted research into the broader issue. \"I admire her for standing up to them. Not everybody is going to be as fortunate. But her situation in terms of being underpaid is far too common.\" US government statistics show that on average, women are paid less than their male counterparts, 79 cents for every dollar a man earns. According to the White House, the median wage of a woman working full-time all year in America is about $39,600 (\u00c2\u00a327,116), 79% of a man's median earnings, which stand at $50,400. The statistic is widely used to illustrate the discrepancy in pay across the sexes, and looks across all sectors. In Fresno, California, Aileen Rizo took a similar stand against her employer after she learned she was receiving less pay than a new male employee, who didn't have a masters degree like she did. Ms Rizo had been working as a maths consultant for four years for Fresno County Office of Education, when she found out that the new hire was being paid at the highest salary scale (a nine), while she was being paid at the lowest (a one). When she confronted her human resources department about the difference, she was told it wasn't a mistake. \"They said they'd used my prior pay as a guide, and that's why I was on less,\" she explained. Ms Rizo began legal action against her employers in 2013, who argued they set wages based on the employee's most recent salary, plus a five percent increase. Experience wasn't a determining factor, they said. Representatives for Fresno County pointed out that a woman working in the same department as Ms Rizo, was being paid more, and said that in the past 25 years more women had been on higher salary scales, than men in the same or similar position in the department. The court ruled in Ms Rizo's favour, arguing that the fact another woman earned more than her, shouldn't diminish her right to a fair wage.  Her employers appealed the decision, and the case is still ongoing. Since she began her lawsuit, Ms Rizo is now receiving the same pay as her male colleague, but she continues to fight for backdated wages. She also testified before the California legislature, which has since passed an Equal Pay Act in the state. While she believes employers need to be more transparent and fair, she does also think women could also do more. \"We do need to get better at negotiating. I was trusting an organisation to act in a way of integrity. I took for granted that that's where everyone started.\" \"Whether you have to file a lawsuit or demand it and get it, women need to empower others and educate society about a problem that's still evident,\" she says. But the scale of the problem is something which is widely debated. Some critics say the \"79 cents for every dollar\" statistic is misleading, because it doesn't compare two people working in the same job, with the same background and qualifications. When those factors are taken into account, there still is a gender pay gap, but the percentage difference is much smaller, at around 7%. \"The idea that when a young woman graduates, the idea she's going to get paid 79 cents for every dollar a man makes, working in the same job, across our economy is a myth,\" argues Karin Agness, who is president of the Network of Enlightened Women, a conservative policy group. Ms Agness believes that the 79 cents statistic gives young graduates a false impression of the workplace they're about to enter. \"It creates a victim mentality in women, and we don't want our young women going into the workforce thinking they are victims just because they are women,\" she says. But Lisa Maatz from the AAUW says both measures are valid - one is more general, the other specifically compares similar roles - but both point to a discrepancy which needs to be addressed. \"The gender wage gap has many causes and contributors, including differences in education, experience, occupation and industry, and family responsibilities. But even after accounting for these factors, a gap still remains between men's earnings and women's earnings,\" argues a White House report on the issue. Data on the pay gap for Hispanic and black women shows greater disparities. The gap between similar jobs fluctuates wildly based on the sector. And even controlling for similar jobs, the gap grows for women who are promoted into the director and executive level. For Ms Maatz, there are other areas which also need to be addressed when it comes to wage disparity, for example the rise of so-called \"pink collar\" jobs, in which certain roles such as nurses, secretaries and teachers, are devalued simply because more women do them. But Robin Wright's experience is a reminder that the gender pay gap affects women across all professions. She hopes her example will encourage other women to speak up. \"It's a male dominant workplace society. It always has been. And that's just the history. \"But it has to be unacceptable at this stage.\" Follow Rajini Vaidyanathan on Twitter - @BBCRajiniv", "The centrepiece is a plan to take any refugees and migrants who cross the sea to Greece in smugglers' boats and return them, directly, to Turkey. European Union officials say whatever is finally agreed \"will comply with both European and international law\". Privately, though, some admit that, while the assessment of their lawyers is \"quite promising\", there are legal hurdles that must be overcome. So can Europe carry out mass returns of entire groups of people? UN officials have cited the European Convention on Human Rights, arguing that it explicitly prohibits the collective expulsion of foreigners. And they say that under international law, it is not illegal for someone fleeing persecution and conflict to cross a border and ask for asylum. Around 90% of those arriving in the Greek islands say they are fleeing conflict, primarily from Syria, Iraq or Afghanistan. Under international law, each person's case must be heard on an individual basis, not as a group, because they may have very good reasons for seeking protection. The second difficulty, UN officials have said, is that while returns can be legal, people can only be sent back to a country that is safe, is able to care for them, give them full access to work, to education, to healthcare, and, most important of all, will take responsibility for processing the individual's asylum claim. The reason many Syrians are leaving Turkey is that it can't provide work, education and healthcare for them all. A system to apply for asylum in Europe from Turkey doesn't exist yet. Until now, the EU has not returned people to Turkey. It hasn't viewed Turkey as what's called a \"safe third country\". Turkey is not a full member of the Geneva Convention. It does not offer Syrians asylum, only a lesser form of international protection. And other groups like Iraqis and Afghans don't even have that option in Turkey. So while returning Syrians is questionable, returning non-Syrians may be even more problematic. Even if all the legal issues are settled there remains the practical problem of how Greece would send back all those making the crossings. Desperate people, men, women and children would have to be rounded up, held and then transported back across the sea. In exchange for the mass returns, the EU is offering to take in large numbers of asylum seekers directly from Turkey. So for every Syrian sent back to Turkey, one already in Turkey will be resettled in Europe. But finding EU countries willing to accept the new arrivals may not be easy. Last year, EU countries pledged to shift thousands of refugees directly from Greece, Italy, and Turkey and give them new homes in the EU. Just a few hundred have actually been moved. Could countries achieve now what they have failed to make happen so far? Hungary has made clear that it is not prepared to accept quotas under this new plan. Other countries in central and eastern Europe are also opposed. So to make this work, a \"coalition of the willing\" - countries prepared to welcome Syrians - will have to be assembled. Germany and the Netherlands may have to be the leaders here, but they will need support from other states too. Among Turkey's demands to secure a deal is visa-free access to the EU for Turks, ideally by the end of June, but there is significant political resistance. It would allow more than 70 million Turks to travel (but not work) visa-free in Europe's Schengen zone. That hasn't happened before now because some EU countries have worried about the political backlash at home from anti-immigrant parties. France in particular has been opposed. The indications from behind closed doors at the summit were that President Francois Hollande may be willing to accept a deal on visas. But then there is the problem that Turkey does not officially recognise the Greek-Cypriot government in Nicosia (Cyprus is an EU member). That's one issue to overcome, and there is also significant opposition to visa concessions for Turkey in the European Parliament, which would have to approve the change as well. Even if all of these issues are resolved, sources say that EU countries will probably still insist Turkey meet all the technical conditions necessary for visa-free access. The hurdles, such as Turkey introducing more sophisticated biometric passports, are significant. This is another of Turkey's demands. It may be largely symbolic, as most EU countries believe Turkey is years away from achieving EU membership, but making any headway on this will be even harder than on the subject of visas. Opposition from Cyprus is one big issue here. Turkey must recognise the government in Cyprus before any new discussions open. Cyprus has stated clearly that it has a clear understanding from other EU countries that \"Turkey cannot use its role in the refugee crisis... to ask for exchanges as regards its EU accession course\". Other countries like Italy and Belgium have doubts about making concessions at a time when there are serious concerns about Turkey's political direction, about declining media freedoms, and worries about a shift towards greater authoritarianism in Turkey's politics. Privately, EU sources say agreement even to open any new accession discussions will be \"very difficult\" and is one of the most important things to clarify if a deal is to be done next week. For all the difficulties, though, there are powerful, political reasons why all sides want a deal. The EU as a whole wants to regain control of events in this refugee crisis. There is a real concern that countries have started going it alone, consensus has broken down, and the EU has to find a plan that reverses that dynamic. There is also a fear that if the refugee crisis remains unresolved, it could affect Britain's EU referendum. Angela Merkel needs a deal as she's come under huge political pressure at home. And the crisis has caused a real rift between the leaders of Germany and Austria that needs to be mended. Other EU leaders want to show their electorates they can protect the EU's borders, fearing that otherwise anti-immigrant parties will seize the political initiative. Closing some border crossings to deal with the refugee crisis has had economic costs too. And a deal suits Turkey as well. It is hosting millions of refugees and is under serious pressure because of the way the war in Syria has shifted with Russia's involvement. Despite their difficulties, the EU and Turkey both benefit if they can make a strategic relationship work, and they need support from each other to deal with the crises they are facing. A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.", "The International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea did, however, allow Ghana to continue developing current oilfields. These include the so called-Ten fields, part owned by UK firm Tullow Oil. Ivory Coast had asked that all drilling be suspended, but the tribunal ruled this would risk \"considerable financial loss\" to Ghana. Instead, it told the West African nation to \"take all necessary steps to ensure than no new drilling either by Ghana or under its control takes place in the disputed area\" and to \"refrain from granting any new permit for oil exploration and exploitation in the disputed area\". The area is believed to contain large reserves of oil, which both countries are keen to exploit. Pending a ruling on the precise maritime border, the tribunal told both countries to \"pursue co-operation and refrain from any unilateral action that might lead to aggravating the dispute\". The ruling was welcomed by Tullow Oil, which owns a large stake in the near $5bn (\u00c2\u00a33.3bn) Ten project, which could reportedly produce up to 80,000 barrels a day. \"Following this ruling, the Ten project can move ahead and we will now await instructions from the government of Ghana with regard to implementing those provisional measures that have been ordered by [the tribunal],\" a Tullow spokesman said.", "According to the military, militants now control only small pockets within the southern Philippine city.

Militants allied to the so-called Islamic State came out onto the streets of Marawi last week after the army attempted to capture a top militant leader. Many residents fled the city as clashes erupted, but a local official said about 2,000 people were unable to leave areas held by the militants. Spokesman for the Philippines' Armed Forces Brig Gen Restituto Padilla said troops were in \"complete control of the city except for certain areas\" held by militants from the Maute group, the local militants who have declared allegiance to IS. He said that \"around 40 to 50 armed elements\" were still present in the city, but this may increase given the militants' activities on the ground including the freeing of more than 100 prisoners from a local jail. He added that 18 military and police personnel had been killed and more than 61 Maute fighters. Reports say the remaining fighters are still believed to be holding several hostages, including a priest and a number of Christians. The violence began when the army failed in its attempt to capture Isnilon Hapilon, believed to be the main IS leader in the Philippines and linked to the Maute. In response the Maute swarmed the city, taking over a hospital and burning down buildings. President Rodrigo Duterte then declared martial law on the southern island of Mindanao, where Marawi is located. The Philippines, which is majority Catholic, has faced Muslim separatist movements for decades in Mindanao with its significant Muslim population. Marawi is known as \"Islamic City\" in the Philippines for its Muslim-majority population.", "It follows last month's announcement that Birmingham Prison is to become the first jail in the UK to be privatised. Prison officers are banned from going on strike, but the ballot will seek the members' views about \"industrial action up to and including strike action\". The government says contingency plans involve the police and military. About 30,000 members of the Prison Officers' Association (POA) in England and Wales will take part in an indicative ballot, which will be considered by union leaders before they decide their next move. POA general secretary Steve Gillan said prison officers were \"angry\" at the government's privatisation plans. National chairman Colin Moses said: \"It is vital members have their say through the ballot box and decide what course of action they are prepared to take to support their colleagues, who have been sold off to the private sector.\" \"Prisons should not be run for profit and whilst Ken Clarke took great pride in announcing the privatisation of these prisons, the POA remains of the view that it is the state's responsibility to imprison its citizens and not profiteers\". A Ministry of Justice spokesman said its aim was to avoid \"any form of industrial action\" and it would continue to talk to unions. \"However, given the risks and complexities involved in running prisons, it is sensible and appropriate to review our contingency plans for dealing with widespread industrial action,\" he said. \"There was a previous trilateral agreement with the police and the military for the provision of support to prisons and we are currently reviewing those arrangements and working with the MoD and police to ensure that our contingency arrangements are as strong as possible.\" Source: Prison Reform Trust In March, security firm G4S was awarded the contract to run Birmingham's 1,400-inmate jail and Featherstone 2 prison, a new jail opening near Wolverhampton. At the time, Justice Secretary Ken Clarke said the move would save money and improve performance on issues such as cutting reoffending rates. Birmingham and Featherstone 2 were among four prisons whose management had been put out to tender. Mr Clarke also announced Serco would continue to run Doncaster Prison, which was built by a private company, and it would become the first prison to be run on a \"payment by results\" basis, with the firm getting its full payment only if reoffending rates were reduced. The other prison - Buckley Hall, in Rochdale - will continue to be run by HM Prison Service. Thirteen private prisons already exist in the UK - 11 in England in Wales, and two in Scotland - but Birmingham is the first existing public sector prison to be contracted out. The 13 prisons are each managed by one of three firms - Kalyx (previously UKDS), Serco or G4S Justice Services.", "They have been the biggest student protests to hit the country since apartheid ended in 1994. The students had rejected an earlier government offer to cap increases at 6%, down from the 10% to 12% proposed by the management of universities. Mr Zuma announced the move as students gathered by his office in the capital. Before he spoke in a TV address, police had been using stun grenades and water cannon to stop a group of students breaking into the Union Buildings, the seat of government in Pretoria. The demonstrations have closed some of the country's top universities. \"We agreed that there will be a zero increase of university fees in 2016,\" Mr Zuma said after meeting university officials and student representatives. \"In the long term, there is a package of issues that was raised at the meeting that needs to be followed up - these include free education, institutional autonomy [and] racism.\" Analysis: Milton Nkosi, BBC News, Pretoria President Zuma's agreement to freeze all university increases to meet the demands of the #FeesMustFall campaign will be welcomed by those who have been at the forefront of this student movement, unprecedented since the end of apartheid. But the decision could have been taken much earlier. The protests have been going on for a little over a week. If it had been, we could have avoided the stun grenades and tear gas, which were fired at student protesters here at the Union Buildings. The protests have cut across South Africa's deep political divide: Black and white, rich and poor stood side by side. No political parties were involved. This is taking the country in a new direction of organic, popular protest, likely to play into next year's local government elections. The hashtag #FeesHaveFallen is now trending across the country, but I doubt this will be the end of the problems facing South Africa's students. There were chaotic scenes at the Union Buildings following the president's speech, with some students angry that Mr Zuma had chosen to make the address on national TV, rather than come out to speak to them directly. Pictures on social media showed police cars that had been damaged and one which was overturned. It is unclear how the freeze on South African university fees will be funded, Vice Chancellor of the University of Cape Town, Max Price, told the BBC after attending meeting with the president. The government said it did not know how much they would pay or where the money would come from, he added. Local media reported that police fired rubber bullets to drive protesters away from the grounds around the president's office. During the protests, universities said they needed to increase fees to maintain standards, a they had been hit by a fall by in government subsidies. Correspondents say the protests have shown the growing disillusionment with the governing African National Congress (ANC), which took power after minority rule ended in 1994, over high levels of poverty, unemployment and corruption in government. Many black students say they come from poor families, and the fee increases would rob them of the opportunity to continue studying. Financially better-off white students have also joined in, mainly to show solidarity with the black students.", "Dale Arnold, 32, died in hospital after being stabbed in Kelloe, near Durham City, on the afternoon of 3 August. Josh Johnson, 19, had been charged with murder, but admitted to the lesser charge of manslaughter, which was accepted at Teesside Crown Court. Johnson, from Ushaw Moor, is due to return to the court on 20 December for sentencing.", "Carrick, 34, suffered the injury late on in Alicante on Friday evening and left the pitch on a stretcher. England boss Hodgson said: \"Michael has got a severely twisted ankle which normally means ligament damage. \"We won't know that of course until he's had an X-ray or a scan, but it doesn't look good.\" Carrick will definitely miss Tuesday's scheduled friendly with France at Wembley.

But then the story changed - he was lost because he had been abandoned by his parents and not just once, but twice in a very short space of time. Since news of his disappearance broke early on Sunday and then the dramatic admission by his parents within 24 hours that they had actually left him in the woods as a punishment, the Japanese public has collectively worried about Yamato Tanooka, trying to make sense of the situation. Abuse? Monster parents? Hansel and Gretel? Or was it just bad parenting, parents pushed over the edge by an active seven-year-old? Active enough, and resourceful enough as it turns out, to trek his way across about 5km (3 miles) and find shelter in a barrack under a roof with mattresses. That the boy's father made him get out of the car \"to discipline him\", but couldn't say so at first because he was afraid of what \"people would think\" has touched many a nerve. The word he used was \"sekentei\" - literally, how one is seen by society. The sense of societal shame he conveyed, on top of his concern for his boy, was perhaps a touch too \"Japanese\" for many here. Hardly anybody voiced support for the father, there was simply no debate about that. The parents should not have let the boy out of their sight, was the consensus. Naoki Ogi, a TV personality and pedagogy expert, better known as \"Ogi-mama\", condemned the parents outright, saying this was neglect and abuse. He also noted and criticised how many parents in Japan tend to see their children as their personal possessions. But then opinions started to vary and there were some more nuanced and sympathetic views. \"Raising kids is hard\" seemed to be the collective sigh heard around social media, TV talk shows, and proverbial water coolers. One famous morning talk show host, Tomoaki Ogura, sympathised with the parents on Monday, on his Fuji TV show \"Tokudane!\". Mr Ogura said: \"To say 'If you're so bad, we can't take you along, just stay here' is a valid way of scolding a child.\" Many recalled how they too were shut out of their homes as children, left throwing a tantrum on the toy shop floor, or shut in a dark closet. A well-known literary critic, Yumi Toyozaki, tweeted on Tuesday: \"I was a restless, rambunctious, cantankerous child, so I feel very much for the father who left his child in the woods for a bit in order to discipline him. I hope people stop condemning him.\" The incident has had many sharing childhood memories of how parents pretended to leave them or their siblings for refusing to listen. Parents also wrote they knew all too well that when small children decide to run off, they can disappear in a flash - there are times when they are simply at the end of their tether. Tomoko Miyakoda , a mother of a four-year old boy, said you have to be extra careful to avoid the worst. But she also stresses it's simply not normal to leave a child anywhere and found it impossible to understand why the parents left their boy in the woods like that.\u3000 But the verdict seemed clear, you don't let a child out of your sight, least of all in a bear-inhabited neck of the woods. So the Japanese public has spent this past week discussing good and bad parenting, what is acceptable punishment and what is abuse. It has come a long way from the days when it was totally fine for a parent to smack a child and many argue this wasn't a clear-cut case of abuse, which is regrettably still too common.", "The statue at the University of Cape Town had been attacked as a surviving symbol of white minority rule. The university's vice-chancellor has backed calls to move the statue and says a final decision will be brought forward to a special meeting next week. Student leaders have hailed a \"victory\" for their Rhodes Must Fall campaign. Vice-chancellor Max Price has said the university's senate accepted calls for the statue to be permanently removed from the campus and that it should be boarded up until a final decision was reached. With more than 180 votes in the senate, only one voted against the statue's removal and there were three abstentions. A meeting of the university's council to decide the statue's fate is being brought forward to next week, said a statement from Dr Price - and there will need to be consultations with local heritage authorities. The statue of Cecil Rhodes has become part of a symbolic struggle at the University of Cape Town, one of the the highest ranking universities in Africa in international league tables. Rhodes, a British politician and business magnate who died in 1902, was a powerful figure in colonial South Africa, and his statue has remained on the campus of this high-profile university. But earlier this month, the statue was attacked by a protester who tipped a bucket of human excrement over the figure of Rhodes. It began several weeks of protest by students who saw the statue as representing the lack of opportunities still facing the black majority two decades after the end of apartheid. It sparked arguments about how modern South Africa should represent the legacy of its colonial and apartheid-era past. There have also been debates about access for black students to top universities. The statue had been wrapped in black plastic to protect it, but it has now been entirely boarded up. \"It is certainly a victory for us,\" said Ramabina Mahapa, president of the student representative council.", "Media playback is not supported on this device Malan targeted South Africa's seamers, striking 12 fours and two sixes in a 44-ball knock as England posted 181-8. Chris Jordan took 3-31 and Tom Curran - in only his second game - 2-22 to restrict the Proteas in their chase. AB de Villiers made 39 and Mangaliso Mosehle 36 off 22 balls but South Africa could manage only 162-7. England, returning to the venue of their Champions Trophy semi-final defeat by Pakistan, put in a professional performance to wrap up the series. Middlesex left-hander Malan, 29, made the highest score by an England player on T20 debut, beating Paul Collingwood's 46 in England's maiden match in this format in 2005. England, whose next white-ball series is not until September against West Indies, begin a four-Test series against South Africa on 6 July. It was a polished performance from England's bowlers, using the short ball to discomfort South Africa, and they were backed up by some strong fielding. Hampshire leg-spinner Mason Crane, who played in the opening T20 at Southampton, was put under pressure as de Villiers struck him for consecutive sixes. However, the 20-year-old showed admirable confidence as he continued to toss the ball up and was rewarded when he drew an error out of the tourists' skipper, who slapped the ball to Alex Hales on the deep square leg boundary. Crane rounded off his spell with a superb over, conceding only two runs as England turned the screw. The Proteas were lacklustre. Of the top six, only De Villiers and opener JJ Smuts (29) reached double figures and it took some big hitting from wicketkeeper Mosehle to push their total up. England's seamers were excellent, with Curran in particular showing a maturity at the end of the innings as he bowled full and straight. The result means the visitors have won only two of their six limited-overs matches on this tour. England captain Eoin Morgan chose to rest himself for the match, a decision that initially drew criticism given this was a must-win game for England, but big-hitting Malan adapted quickly to international cricket. Arriving at the crease after Jason Roy fell for eight, Malan left his first delivery but pulled the second ferociously into the stands for six. On a pitch tinged with green, he took on the short ball against the seamers. He did not let up against a change of pace, nonchalantly flicking leg-spinner Imran Tahir over his shoulder to bring up his half-century from 31 deliveries. Malan and Hales, who was struggling to run after edging the ball on to his knee, put on 105 in 10.3 overs. When Malan finally fell, caught at long-on off Tahir, stand-in captain Jos Buttler struck two flat sixes to push England above 180. Media playback is not supported on this device The manner in which England went about such a calm and assured victory will be more heartening giving the changes they made to their side. As well as Morgan being rested, England gave Crane another opportunity, as well as Curran. For South Africa, it was a disappointing return, given how strong they were in the closing stages at Taunton. They were sloppy in the field to begin with. Andile Phehlukwayo's drop to reprieve Hales on 13 was so surprising the batsman had turned to walk back to the pavilion. South Africa will take some comfort in the performance of right-armer Paterson, who was twice on a hat-trick in the final overs thanks to his mixture of yorkers and slower balls. However, it was England who controlled the majority of the game. England stand-in captain Jos Buttler: \"Dawid Malan was fantastic on debut. It is not easy to come in and show that much composure under pressure. On debut it was a fantastic effort. \"Mason Crane, for a 20-year-old, has got great character. He was bowling at one of the best players that have ever played the game on a ground with a short boundary. \"It was very tough on him but all credit for having the bravery and guts to keep going and get the wicket. I am sure he will remember it for a long time. \"We have found some really great players. You find out a lot about players - international cricket is different and those guys have stepped up. Tom Curran was brilliant for his two games. \"Taunton is not an easy place to make your debut and he took three wickets and two today. He looks a real find.\" South Africa captain AB de Villiers: \"We were outplayed in both of these series. Well done to England and Eoin Morgan in the majority of the games, and Jos Buttler today, for leading them. \"England put in an all-round better performance today. We were not far off but it was disappointing. \"England do have some really good youngsters. They have good depth and all round are a really good team. \"They seem to be going through a good patch and have a lot of talent. They have a bright five to 10 years ahead of them.\" On Mason Crane: \"I was always going to go after him. Well done to him for sticking to his guns.\" Dawid Malan, who was named man of the match: \"It is a fantastic experience to play for your country and to contribute in a win like that on debut is fantastic. \"I thought this day might never come. I had a chat with Adam Voges, who played later for Australia. \"I asked what he did and how he kept motivated when you keep getting overlooked for younger and younger players. He gave me some advice and fortunately I had a good Lions series and got picked when players were rested.\"", "On Friday, Shane Long's first-half goal looked set to give the hosts victory before Luuk de Jong's late equaliser. \"I was very pleased - I thought we did fine,\" said O'Neill. \"The Dutch had good possession of the ball (early on), which was actually very good for us because we had to play without it for a little while.\" He added: \"Then we scored the goal, which obviously gave us a big lift. I thought we played fine, we kept possession of the ball reasonably well after that.\" Media playback is not supported on this device However, O'Neill rued de Jong's 85th-minute equaliser as the striker punished a spot of ball-watching from central defender Shane Duffy although the manager described the Blackburn man's overall performance in only his third cap as \"excellent\". Bournemouth midfielder Harry Arter appeared to do his chances of inclusion in O'Neill's Euro 2016 squad no harm as he was named man of the match after winning only his second cap. \"I think Harry did well, young (Stephen) Quinn did well also,\" added the Republic boss. Goalscorer Long was again bothered by a cut on his knee in Friday's game and O'Neill hinted that the Southampton striker may be rested in the final warm-up game against Belarus in Cork on Tuesday. Long's likely absence could see Republic record goalscorer Robbie Keane returning to the side for his 144th appearance.", "Bates, who has been Tigers promoter for three years, has taken full control of the Lions and will work alongside co-promoter David Darcy. Bates said: \"We're only weeks away from the new season and so our main priority is to quickly form a team. \"We have opened talks with several riders and should be in a position to announce the first signings any day.\" Lions endured a miserable season last time out and finished bottom of the Elite League table. But Bates said he hoped the club's financial difficulties were a thing of the past. \"I am aware that Leicester went through a difficult trading period last season,\" he said. \"And I will be doing everything possible to ensure that the club is placed on a sound financial footing that secures the future of Leicester Speedway for years to come.\"", "The left-back was expected to miss Saturday's defeat by Aberdeen while he sought the advice of a specialist to help with a hip complaint. But Clark was impressed as the former Rangers defender declared himself fit. \"He has shown the courage that he wants to play through the little injury problem he has,\" said Clark. \"He didn't look like he had any injury on Saturday.\" Smith could not prevent Kilmarnock losing 2-1 to the side sitting second top of the table and falling five points behind Hamilton Academical in their battle to escape the play-off place. However, Clark said of his captain: \"I saw him bombing down the line in the 94th minute to try and put a cross in as we chased an equaliser. \"So I was really happy he was back in the team. \"It's no co-incidence we looked a stronger team when Stevie was back in. \"He's a good example to everyone else in the squad that, as captain, he's willing to put himself forward when not 100% fit and roll his sleeves up. That's brilliant for me.\" However, Clark insisted that he would not want Smith to do anything that would cause problems with his career. \"I'm not a manager who wants to put somebody in jeopardy by making an injury worse, but it's great to see him putting his body on the line to help the club,\" he added. \"We are hoping to manage him through until the end of the season. \"Ultimately, it will be down to Steve whether that proves too difficult. \"Some sessions he might just work with the physio, but he's an experienced player, he's got good fitness levels and knows his body, so we're prepared to work with him to get him out on the park on a match day, because having him there will be crucial for us.\"", "Mr Newman was detained in Melbourne on Thursday after entering Australia without a visa. Australia had cancelled his visa while he was still in the US on the grounds that his presence in the country could incite violence. Mr Newman has previously called for the execution of abortion doctors and said women who have abortions are murderers. On Friday, Justice Geoffrey Nettle in Melbourne ruled that the cancellation of Mr Newman's visa was justified, reported the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. While Mr Newman may have had a case to challenge the cancellation, he should not have boarded a plane to Australia without a visa, said the judge. \"Acting as he did means he does not come to this court with clean hands,\" he said. Mr Newman, also known as Troy Newman-Mariotti, had been due to speak at events run by the group Right to Life Australia. But he was prevented from boarding a connecting flight in the US city of Denver on Tuesday after Immigration Minister Peter Dutton cancelled his visa. It came after it emerged he had called in a 2000 book for doctors who perform abortions to face execution . His wife Mellissa had presented his appeal to the high court in Melbourne. \"I don't know what they're afraid of. I don't know what they think he's going to do here,\" she was quoted as saying earlier by ABC News. In a posting on Facebook ahead of his arrival in Melbourne, he said the decision to revoke his visa \"was based on a pile of lies, including the idea that I promote violence\". \"My 25-year history of peaceful, prayerful action speaks for itself,\" he said. Earlier this week, Australian Labor MP Terri Butler wrote to Australia's Mr Dutton to ask that Mr Newman's visa be denied, calling him an \"anti-choice extremist\". But the website for Mr Newman's organisation, Operation Rescue, insisted that he \"has never advocated violence and in fact, urges pro-life activists to work within the governmental and legal system to accomplish change\".", "Monarchs are the only insects to migrate such a vast distance. So, by teaming up with biologists, mathematicians set out to recreate the internal compass they use to navigate on that journey. The findings are published in the journal Cell Reports. Lead researcher Prof Eli Shlizerman, from the University of Washington, explained that, as a mathematician, he wants to know how neurobiological systems are wired and what rules we can learn from them. \"Monarch butterflies [complete their journey] in such an optimal, predetermined way,\" he told BBC News. \"They end up in a particular location in Central Mexico after two months of flight, saving energy and only using a few cues.\" Prof Shlizerman worked with biologist colleagues, including Steven Reppert at the University of Massachusetts, to record directly from neurons in the butterflies' antennae and eyes. \"We identified that the input cues depend entirely on the Sun,\" explained Prof Shlizerman. \"One is the horizontal position of the Sun and the other is keeping the time of day. \"This gives [the insects] an internal Sun compass for travelling southerly throughout the day.\" Having worked out the inputs for this internal compass, Prof Shlizerman then created a model system to simulate it. This consisted of two control mechanisms - one based on the timekeeping \"clock\" neurons in the butterflies' antennae and the other from what are called azimuth neurons in their eyes. These monitor the position of the Sun. \"The circuit gets those two signals then matches them, according to how it's wired, to control signals that tell the system if a correction is needed to stay on the correct course,\" explained Prof Shlizerman. \"For me this is very exciting - it shows how a behaviour is produced by the integration of signals,\" he added. \"We can take these concepts to produce robotic versions of these systems - something [that is] powered by and that navigates by the Sun.\" Prof Shlizerman said that one of his team's goals was to build a robotic monarch butterfly that could follow the insects and track their entire migration. \"It's a very interesting application that could follow the butterflies and even help maintain them. \"Their numbers are decreasing, so we want to keep this insect - the only one that migrates these huge distances - with us for many years.\" Prof Matthew Cobb from the University of Manchester told BBC News that the study showed that \"something as astounding as the monarch migration can be understood in terms of cellular circuitry\". \"Our current robots are far cruder than even the simplest nervous system,\" he added.

The inquest coroner in Taunton recorded a conclusion the 14-year-old had taken her own life by hanging. Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust said it had apologised to the family and improvements had been made. The inquest heard Sofia, a student at Kings of Wessex Academy in Cheddar, had been suffering from low moods, was self-harming and was expressing thoughts about taking her own life. She was referred to the Child and Adolescent Mental Services (CAMHS) in March 2015, but did not meet the criteria for specialist support. In February 2016, her GP made an urgent referral to CAMHS, after Sofia confessed to having suicidal thoughts. But after being seen twice by CAMHS in July 2016, she was told there was a six-month waiting list for cognitive behaviour therapy. Her family found her body when they returned home on the evening of 20 September. On the day before she died, a CAMHS worker met Sofia and her mother, giving a crisis plan stating her mother Sandy Legg needed \"to watch her and keep a close eye on her\". But investigation reports stated Sofia had to be \"supervised at all times\". \"If constant supervision was necessary then this should have been stated directly to me before I left with Sofia,\" her mother told the hearing.

Other moguls are in the private space race, too, after Nasa this year ended its 30-year space shuttle programme. Virgin Galactic is working on a commercial space venture which aims to fly passengers into sub-orbit by 2013. Aerospace pioneer Burt Rutan is a partner on Mr Allen's project, which is called Stratolaunch Systems. The project is the latest to be led by Silicon Valley tycoons who think they spy a gap in demand opened by the retirement of the US government's space shuttle programme. While Nasa put rockets into space from a launch pad, the Stratolaunch plan is to launch unmanned rockets from high-flying aircraft, and eventually undertake manned missions too. The developers said their aircraft could ferry cargo for the commercial satellite industry and the International Space Station. The giant plane would be powered by six 747 jumbo jet engines and have a wingspan of 385ft (117m), developers said. It would be wider than the biggest aircraft ever, legendary Hollywood tycoon Howard Hughes' Spruce Goose. The first test flights are scheduled to begin in 2016. Mr Allen and Mr Rutan said that preliminary designs for the Stratolaunch aircraft have been put together over the course of 10 years. Construction has begun on a hangar in California's Mojave Desert, they said. In 2004 the duo created SpaceShipOne, a sub-orbital rocket that became the first privately financed, manned spaceship. \"When I was growing up, America's space programme was the symbol of aspiration,\" Mr Allen said at a news conference in Seattle. \"For me, the fascination with space never ended. I never stopped dreaming what might be possible.\" Stratolaunch's plane will carry a booster rocket on its belly, to be built by a space company owned by Elon Musk of PayPal, who has already built a successful commercial rocket. Other technology titans who have made forays into the private space industry include Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon.com. British tycoon Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic aims to take passengers into sub-orbital space. Dropping rockets into space is not a new technique, but can offer more launch flexibility and minimise weather constraints, developers said. It can also save on rocket fuel. Orbital Sciences Corp, an older rocket company, has used this method of launching payloads such as unmanned rockets and satellites.", "The revolutionary technology will allow wind power to be harvested in waters too deep for the current conventional bottom-standing turbines used. The Peterhead wind farm, known as Hywind, is a trial which will bring power to 20,000 homes. Manufacturer Statoil says output from the turbines is expected to equal or surpass generation from current ones. It hopes to cash in on a boom in the technology, especially in Japan and the West coast of the US, where waters are deep. \"This is a tech development project to ensure it's working in open sea conditions. It's a game-changer for floating wind power and we are sure it will help bring costs down,\" said Leif Delp, project director for Hywind. So far, one giant turbine has already been moved into place, while four more wait in readiness in a Norwegian fjord. By the end of the month they'll all have been towed to 15 miles off Peterhead, Aberdeenshire, where they'll float upright like giant fishing floats. While the turbines are currently very expensive to make, Statoil believes that in the future it will be able to dramatically reduce costs in the same way that manufacturers already have for conventional offshore turbines. \"I think eventually we will see floating wind farms compete without subsidy - but to do that we need to get building at scale,\" said Mr Delp. The operation to begin shifting the first of the 11,500 tonne giants happened dramatically in the half-light of a Norwegian summer night. Crews secured thick cables to tug boats and used remote-controlled submarines to check for obstacles. Finally the giant was on the move, floating on a sealed vase-like tube 78 metres deep, its bottom filled with iron ore to weight the base and keep it upright in the water. The price of energy from bottom-standing offshore wind farms has plummeted 32% since 2012 - far faster that anyone predicted. The price is now four years ahead of the government's expected target, and another big price drop is expected, taking offshore wind to a much lower price than new nuclear power. The Hywind project is being run in collaboration with the Abu Dhabi firm Masdar. The \u00c2\u00a3190m cost was subsidised by bill-payers under the UK government's Renewable Obligation Certificates. The bird charity RSPB Scotland opposed the project - not because it dislikes the technology but because it believes too many offshore turbines in the area have already been approved. It fears thousands of sea birds may be killed by the offshore wind farms, although it admits that estimates are hugely uncertain because it is impossible to count bird corpses at sea. The RSPB's Aidan Smith told BBC News: \"Generally we are very enthusiastic about floating wind technology because it allows turbines to be placed far offshore - away from seabird nesting sites, and it helps us tackle climate change. \"We oppose the Hywind project because it adds to a situation we already believe is a problem.\" Floating turbines may create a new frontier for energy - but scientists on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warn far more investment in additional new technologies is urgently needed for governments to keep promises on reducing emissions.

The mineral talc in its natural form does contain asbestos and does cause cancer, however, asbestos-free talc has been used in baby powder and other cosmetics since the 1970s. But the studies on asbestos-free talc give contradictory results. It has been linked to a cancer risk in some studies, but there are concerns that the research may be biased as they often rely on people remembering how much talc they used years ago. Other studies have argued there is no link at all and there is no link between talc in contraceptives such as diaphragms and condoms (which would be close to the ovaries) and cancer. Also there does not seem to be a \"dose-response\" for talc, unlike with known carcinogens like tobacco where the more you smoke, the greater the risk of lung cancer. The charity Ovacome says there is no definitive evidence and that the worst-case scenario is that using talc increases the risk of cancer by a third. But it adds: \"Ovarian cancer is a rare disease, and increasing a small risk by a third still gives a small risk. So even if talc does increase the risk slightly, very few women who use talc will ever get ovarian cancer.\" The jury in Ms Fox's case deliberated for five hours before finding Johnson & Johnson liable for fraud, negligence and conspiracy. The award constituted $10m in damages and $62m in punitive damages. \"This case clearly was a bellwether and clearly the jury has seen the evidence and found it compelling,\" said Stanford University law professor Nora Freeman Engstrom. \"The jury was distressed by the company's conduct.\" However, she said the size of the award was unlikely to survive. \"Big jury verdicts do tend to be reined in during the course of the appellate process and I expect that to be the case here,\" she said. Cancer Research UK says evidence for a link between talc use and ovarian cancer is \"still uncertain\". \"Even if there is a risk it is likely to be fairly small,\" the charity says. Ovarian cancer charity Ovacome says causes of the disease are still unknown but are likely to be \"a combination of many different inherited and environmental factors, rather than one cause such as talc\". It says that in 2003, results of 16 studies involving 12,000 women showed that using talc increased the risk of ovarian cancer by around a third, and that a 2013 review of US studies involving 18,000 women had similar results for genital, but not general, talcum powder use. However, it warns that studies of this type \"can suffer from bias\" and there were \"uncertainties\" around the results. \"A large well-designed American study in 2000 involving nearly 80,000 women found no link between using talc and the risk of ovarian cancer,\" it says. The charity says that even if using talc does raise the ovarian cancer risk by a third, \"to put it into context, smoking and drinking increases the risk of oesophageal cancer by 30 times\".", "The Conservatives claimed the amount councils are spending on education is at its lowest level for six years. But the Scottish government said the figures being quoted were \"inaccurate and misleading\". Each council decides for itself just how much to spend on education although some important costs like teachers' pay are set nationally. The Conservatives claimed official government figures said spending on education by councils had fallen to its lowest level for six years. They said councils spent \u00c2\u00a34.67 billion between them last year - down \u00c2\u00a3140m on the previous year. The government said the Conservatives' figures were wrong as some of the numbers quoted were not directly comparable. Scottish Conservative education spokeswoman Mary Scanlon said: \"At a time when the schools budget in England has been protected, these new figures reveal another cut in funding for schools in Scotland. \"The cost of this is clear. In England the number of full-time teachers has increased by more than 3,000 between 2010 and 2013. \"But in Scotland, over the same period, the numbers have fallen by around 1,000. \"This is the price schools are paying for the SNP's failure to take any responsibility for our schools system and undertake the reforms that are necessary to turn it around. \"It's not good enough for them to blame others - the cuts to spending and the fall in literacy and numeracy standards is happening on the SNP's watch.\" But the Scottish government insisted the Conservatives' use of figures is wrong. A Scottish government spokesperson said: \"This comparison is completely inaccurate and misleading, as it compares net expenditure in 2014/15 with gross expenditure for past years. Provisional outturn was higher in 2014-15 than it was in 2013-14. \"We also know councils are planning to spend 3.3% more on the delivery of education in 2015-16 - the largest increase in six years. \"We know spending per pupil is significantly higher in Scotland than England. \"Despite Westminster austerity, we remain wholly committed to mitigating the effects of welfare cuts and ensuring our education system is resourced to continue to meet the needs of children, parents, schools and communities.\" The largest teaching union, the EIS, said education budgets had been under pressure, but had little sympathy for the Conservatives' claims. General secretary Larry Flanagan said: \"The damaging age of austerity imposed by the UK government has had a significant detrimental impact on the funding available to public services in Scotland. \"Education has not been immune from the downward pressure on Scottish government and local authority budgets, and this had led to serious challenges in our schools owing to declining teacher numbers, lack of school resources and rising class sizes. \"The attempt by the Tory party, however, to exploit the impact of an austerity programme which they are imposing seems somewhat hypocritical. \"Scottish education needs additional resources but it does not need the type of retrograde policies pursued so disastrously in England by the likes of Michael Gove.\" Each council decides for itself just how much to spend on education, although some important costs like teachers' pay are set nationally. However, councils receive the overwhelming bulk of their money from the Scottish government. Education is the biggest service councils provide, and the biggest challenge facing councils just now is money. Typically about 80% of each council's budget comes from the Scottish government. Council tax, which makes up most of the rest, has been frozen since 2007. The latest council funding agreement obliged councils to maintain teacher numbers or risk losing money. Some councils objected to this - arguing this amounted to micro-management in their affairs, and claiming there was more to raising attainment in schools than simply maintaining teacher numbers. While the government strongly disputes the Conservatives' use of figures, there is little doubt that some council education budgets are under scrutiny as councils continue to look for savings. In recent months four councils looked at reducing the length of the primary school week, while services such as school libraries have also been under the spotlight. The Scottish government - which currently receives all its money from Westminster - argues it has been trying to do its best for councils in the face of tight funding settlements and believes the council tax freeze has been a help to family budgets. However, critics point out that councils are left with little practical control of the size of their overall budgets.", "Ibrahim Halawa has been detained in an Egyptian prison for more than three years. His trial was adjourned for a 17th time on Tuesday. Charlie Flanagan said the government's focus was on supporting an application for Mr Halawa to be deported. The Irish government has also requested that he be considered for release under a new Egyptian government amnesty scheme for young prisoners. Mr Halawa, who turned 21 on Tuesday, is the son of Ireland's most senior Muslim cleric and was arrested during anti-government protests in Cairo in August 2013. He has been charged along with 463 others with inciting violence, rioting and sabotage relating to the protests in Cairo. Mr Halawa appeared in court on Tuesday and told judges that he was innocent and asked to be allowed to return home. His family has denied claims that Mr Halawa is a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt's oldest and largest Islamist organisation. The Egyptian government has declared it a terrorist group, a claim the organisation rejects. More than 1,000 people have been killed and 40,000 are believed to have been jailed since President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi led the military's overthrow of Mohammed Morsi, Egypt's first democratically elected head of state, in 2013.", "Republicans ambushed a mini-bus carrying the men at Kingsmill in County Armagh in 1976 and murdered them after checking what religion they were. Senior coroner John Leckey is retiring this year and told a preliminary hearing of the inquest in Belfast that no replacement has been appointed. His retirement could leave only one coroner in Northern Ireland. Kingsmill is among dozens of inquests dating from the early days of the Troubles that face delay because not enough money is available to investigate or there is nobody to oversee fresh hearings. Mr Leckey said: \"I feel for the bereaved families, not exclusively Kingsmill but for other inquests I am involved in. \"It is a disappointment that is widespread.\" A lawyer for some of the Kingsmill victims' families said they would be pressing Stormont's justice department for more resources to allow an inquest to go ahead. Karen Armstrong, a sister of one of the murdered men, said the lack of resources was \"a political problem\". \"We are not going to lie down and accept it,\" she said. \"We will fight until we get another date and they have to make sure there are enough coroners in Northern Ireland to deal with our and many other cases.\" Ulster Unionist MLA Danny Kennedy said he would be asking Justice Minister David Ford to ensure the matter was referred to the relevant authorities so that \"action can be taken as soon as possible\". \"Justice has been denied for almost 40 years and it is totally unacceptable that this inquest should be delayed further due to the unavailability of a coroner,\" he said. \"This was one of the most shocking and cruel events of the Troubles and the inquest must be treated with the seriousness this crime merits.\" A Department of Justice spokesman said: \"Officials are actively working to ensure that all necessary resources are provided for the conduct of inquests in Northern Ireland. \"There are currently three full-time coroners in Northern Ireland. In addition, one High Court judge and one County Court judge have also been appointed as coroners.\"", "He is one of 249 men suing the Catholic Church over alleged historical sexual abuse at St William's residential school in Market Weighton. Only one man out of five initial cases heard at the High Court in Leeds has been awarded compensation. In December, a judge ruled in favour of one claimant and ordered the church to pay \u00c2\u00a314,000 in damages. At the same hearing, His Honour Judge Gosnell dismissed three other claims. More on this and other East Yorkshire stories In January 2016 the former head of St William's James Carragher was jailed for the third time after he was found guilty of sexually abusing boys. Carragher, 75, had already been sentenced to 21 years in prison for sexually abusing boys and was jailed for a further nine years in January. He was jailed for seven years in 1993 and a further 14 years in 2004 for offences he committed at St William's, which closed in 1992. Co-defendant Anthony McCallen, 69, a former chaplain at St William's, was sentenced to 15 years in prison for a series of historical sex offences. He was acquitted of eight other charges at the same trial. The De La Salle Brothers, a Christian order of lay teachers, which ran the school in conjunction with the Diocese of Middlesbrough, has apologised \"unreservedly\" for the abuse. Another set of compensation claims is expected to be heard in late 2017.", "The exhibition, From Dark to Light, explores the work of artist Victor Noble Rainbird, who was born in North Shields in 1887. The largest collection to have been staged since the 1930s, his favourite subjects were the North Sea and the streets and people of his hometown. Curator Dave Young said there was a lot of affection for him in the town. Many of the pieces on display at The Old Low Light Heritage Centre in North Shields have never been seen in public before. Mr Young, said: \"We hope that this exhibition will shed new light on the life and work of a remarkable man and also a much misunderstood artist. \"This is the first major exhibition of his paintings to be held in his hometown of North Shields since the artist's lifetime and it is being held in a building that he would have known well and often painted. \"Victor Noble Rainbird's paintings are a fascinating legacy of life in the North East before and after the Great War, while his own remarkable war record is only now being unravelled.\" Mr Rainbird joined the Northumberland Fusiliers in 1914 when he was 26-years-old and served on the Western Front at Ypres, Passchendaele, Vimy Ridge and Armentieres. Some of the drawings he produced while on active service have survived and are included in the exhibition. Mr Young said they were a \"poignant, important and sombre record of the horrors of war\". After the war, Rainbird made several return trips to France, Belgium and the Netherlands, producing some of his most impressive works. He died aged 47 in 1936. From Dark to Light: exploring the life and art of Victor Noble Rainbird is on display at The Old Low Light Heritage Centre from 10 July to 6 September.", "The sign - on the Beeston-bound platform of the Queen's Medical Centre stop - points commuters towards the \"Univeristy Of Nottingham\". The error could have been there for \"seven to eight months\", it is estimated. A Nottingham Express Transport (NET) spokesman said they will now be looking to replace the sign next week. People were quick to condemn the \"unfortunate error\", captured by a BBC journalist. It follows another spelling mishap spotted on a sign last July on the network, which stated \"Chillwell Road\" rather than Chilwell Road. \"Absolute joke - what is happening with the world,\" Melanie Winskill wrote on BBC Radio Nottingham's Facebook page. Gill Bennett pondered: \"Maybe the people responsible didn't go to university.\" A NET spokesman said it is unsure how long the error has existed at the stop, but added it \"could have been there for seven to eight months\". \"Clearly this is an unfortunate error made during the production of the sign,\" the spokesman said. \"We will be looking to replace it as soon as possible next week now it has been pointed out.\"", "Visitors to Jane Austen's House Museum, in Chawton, Hampshire, can view a rarely seen letter in which Austen says the novel is \"my own darling child\". Also featured are illustrations first included in an 1894 edition, dancing slippers and first editions. The Story of Pride And Prejudice exhibition is open until May. The museum's Madelaine Smith said the enduring appeal of the novel is its perennial themes and that the \"characters are real\". The museum will also stage a contemporary art exhibition of works inspired by Pride And Prejudice from June to September. Another display later in the year of the original costumes worn in the 1995 BBC adaptation of the novel, will include the white shirt worn by actor Colin Firth as Mr Darcy when he emerged from a lake. \"We're not sure if we're going to have it on display wet, but if we do we'll have to spray it daily with water,\" Ms Smith said.", "The first minister is one of six UK representatives in Forbes magazine's annual list of the world's most powerful and influential women. A Scottish government spokesman said the list underlined the importance both of the first minister's office and the profile of Scotland as a nation. German Chancellor Angela Merkel topped the list for the sixth year running. Presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton was placed second, with Janet Yellen, chairwoman of the US Federal Reserve, third. The Queen is 29th, while Ms Sturgeon is 50th overall. The rankings consider influence, media presence, wealth and success at implementing change. The other British women who made the list are Bank of England deputy governor Nemat Shafik at 59, Guardian editor Katharine Viner at 68, Economist editor Zanny Minton Beddoes at 78, and Eliza Manningham-Buller, chairwoman of the Wellcome Trust, at 88. German Chancellor Angela Merkel tops the list for the sixth year in a row - and the 11th time in total. As a central figure in German politics ever since reunification, Ms Merkel has led Germany since 2005 and is a leading force in the European Union. Choosing her for top spot, Forbes noted that \"if there is a single leader able to defy existential economic and political challenges to the European Union, from edges and core, it has been Angela Merkel.\" Hillary Clinton looks set to go head-to-head with Donald Trump for the position of President of the United States in November. Mrs Clinton, who has had previous spells in the White House as first lady to husband Bill and as foreign secretary to current President Barack Obama, is bidding to become the first female President. She has also served as a senator for New York state, and was a leading lawyer, serving as the first female chair of the Legal Services Corporation and the first female partner at Rose Law Firm. Janet Yellen is chair of the Federal Reserve, the central banking system of the United States. Having previously chaired the White House Council of Economic Advisors under the Bill Clinton administration, Ms Yellen took over at the Fed in 2014, and managed the body through its first interest rate rise since June 2006.

Co-founder of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, alongside her former Microsoft head husband, Mrs Gates organised $4.2bn in charitable work and global development in 2015 alone. The foundation has given out $36.7bn in grant payments since it was founded in 2000, with Mrs Gates directing the organisation and in particular championing investments in women and girls around the globe. Forbes said her work had \"inspired other big donors and changed the way funders think about effective philanthropy\". Mary Barra was promoted from chief executive to president of General Motors in January, having guided the firm to record profits in 2015. Ms Barra has been credited with turning around the fortunes of the American car-making giant, which had to recall 30 million vehicles in 2014 due to faulty ignition switches blamed for at least 124 deaths, by fostering strong domestic sales alongside growth in China. Forbes said her latest promotion was \"no surprise\", with Ms Barra leading the company on a \"noticeable comeback\" - and earning herself a compensation package of $28.6m last year.", "Simon Hamilton said if they want the highest standard of health and social care, then the current configuration of services is not going to work. Mr Hamilton pulled no punches in his first keynote address in his new role. He said the real challenge was the absence of political agreement on the future of health and social care. Mr Hamilton acknowledged the worries that reform will lead to the closure of facilities. But he added that its growing and ageing population means Northern Ireland has to do things differently. In a hard-hitting speech with lots of plain talking, the minister said attachments to the bricks and mortar of the National Health Service [NHS] must not act as a barrier that inhibits people from getting the best healthcare. Instead, he called on people to embrace change and allow the NHS to move with the times.", "Grant's side are in the semi-finals of the Africa Cup of Nations but that has not stopped some Ghanaians expressing dissatisfaction with the performances. \"Every player had has criticism at one time or another. I would like that to change,\" said the Israeli. \"I don't know why they target players. I would like them to respect the payers, who are giving everything.\" Ghana are seeking an elusive fifth Nations Cup title in Gabon - their last came in 1982. And they are showing the kind of resilience and quality necessary to end that 35-year wait, having beaten DR Congo 2-1 in Sunday's quarter-final to reach the last four. But some people have questioned whether the team is sufficiently equipped to go all the way, and Aston Villa forward Jordan Ayew appears to be the focus of the doubters' negativity. \"Jordan is having a great tournament,\" Grant countered. \"He gave a great assist to Asamoah Gyan against Mali and scored a great goal against DR Congo in the quarter-final. \"Also his performance statistics are great and they show he is running a lot. He is answering his critics on the pitch.\" The Black Stars will meet Cameroon on Thursday for a place in the final. \"It will be very tough, we saw Cameroon's quarter-final win over Senegal and they played very well,\" Grant said. \"Cameroon will have one more day rest than us but we've shown we can deal with difficulties. \"My team is improving, every game we get fitter and sharper. And this team has a big heart.\"", "Justine Curran said the force had to restrict leave during summer and Christmas for operational reasons. Head teachers in England can only grant absence during school time in \"exceptional circumstances\". Ms Curran has asked head teachers to use their discretion to \"fully consider\" holiday requests. In her letter, Ms Curran wrote: \"I fully support the notion that every child needs to attend school regularly and absences should be minimised wherever possible.\" She said that over the summer Humberside officers would be helping to police the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow and the Nato Summit in south Wales. Paul Yeomans chairman of the Humberside Police Federation, which represents junior officers, said his members supported the chief constable's call. \"They're not able to take their leave during the peak times and it is not their fault,\" he said. If parents in England and Wales fail to ensure their children attend school, they may be issued with penalty notices of \u00a350 to \u00a3100. Prosecution can result in a fine of up to \u00a32,500, a jail sentence of up to three months or a community sentence. In a letter to Sir Hugh Orde, president of the Association of Chief Police Officers, the Education Secretary Michael Gove said the Department for Education guidance to head teachers \"does not specify what constitutes exceptional circumstances\". He added: \"Neither have we said that leave of absence can or cannot be granted to families of certain occupations.\" John Killeen, head of South Cave Primary School and local representative of the National Association of Head Teachers union, said there was \"inflexibility in a lot of professions\". \"We have sympathy with the police service but it would make the head teacher's position untenable with the rest if the parent body if they started making exceptions.\"", "Media playback is not supported on this device The Frenchman was one of the most promising of a new generation of Formula 1 drivers. Bianchi, who was part of the Ferrari young driver programme, lost his battle on the night of Friday, 17 July - nine months after the crash. The accident that led to Bianchi's death came in an unfortunate combination of circumstances in a difficult wet race at the Suzuka track. During the lap before Bianchi's accident, Sauber's Adrian Sutil had crashed at the fast, uphill Dunlop corner. A recovery vehicle headed out to pick the car up and that section of track was put under double waved yellow caution flags, meaning a hazard bad enough that drivers should be prepared to stop. On the next lap, on worn tyres, Bianchi arrived at the corner and lost control, and the car speared off the track and collided with the recovery vehicle, which destroyed the Marussia's roll hoop, a device that protects the driver's head. Bianchi suffered massive head injuries. After an operation, he was placed in intensive care but he succumbed three quarters of a year later. In only 34 races he had done enough with the back-of-the-grid Marussia team to suggest he had a bright future in the sport. It is never easy for a new driver in a struggling team to prove his worth, but Bianchi had done so by producing performances that would not normally be expected of the car, and outclassing his team-mate, Englishman Max Chilton. There were a number of impressive drives from Bianchi, but the most high profile was his taking ninth place in the Monaco Grand Prix in May last year. In doing so, he scored Marussia's first and only points, as the team folded at the end of 2014. They now race as Manor. It was too early in Bianchi's career to judge his ultimate potential, and whether he could have gone on to become a race winner and even world champion. But the signs were there that he was set for a significant career at the highest level of the sport. Ferrari signed four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel to replace the departing Fernando Alonso in 2015, but they had earmarked Bianchi as the man who would probably drive a third car for the team, should they be required to run one if the grid dropped below 20 cars. Ferrari's former president Luca Di Montezemolo said: \"This boy was born with us, and we thought of him as our driver of the future...  he would have been perfect for the coming years.\" Bianchi came from a racing family, and it is the second time they have been touched by tragedy. His grand-uncle Lucien Bianchi competed in 19 F1 grands prix, with a best finish of third at Monaco in 1968, and won the 1968 Le Mans 24 Hours, before being killed testing for the race the following year. Bianchi's career in F1 started in 2011, when Ferrari signed him up to be their test and reserve driver, although he had had a relationship with the team for at least two years before that. Ferrari loaned him out to fulfil the same role for Force India in 2012, before they facilitated his move to Marussia, to whom they supplied engines, for his debut season in 2013. Then Ferrari decided against promoting Bianchi to partner Alonso in 2014, preferring to sign for a second time Finn Kimi Raikkonen, who won the world title for the team in 2007. Media playback is not supported on this device His death has led to a period of introspection in a sport that had never stopped trying to improve safety since the triple world champion Ayrton Senna was killed at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix, the last F1 race driver to lose his life. Alonso, a two-time world champion and close to Bianchi, said: \"This is a reminder for us that this is very dangerous, for the spectators as well. We are here because we like our job and we are ready to take the risk because we need the adrenaline somehow as well. But we cannot make mistakes.\" His colleagues acknowledged Bianchi's misfortune, at the same time expressing a belief that he would want them to go on, and a hope that F1 can apply whatever lessons emerge from the inquiry into his death to make the sport that will always be dangerous safer again. As with Senna's death, safety changes have already been put in place, aimed at ensuring such an incident can never happen again.", "The Briton produced a stunning lap to be 0.360 seconds quicker than Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg - and seemed as if he may have been able to go faster. But the track was empty for the final five minutes and senior figures said the format should be rethought. Red Bull team boss Christian Horner said F1 should \"apologise to the fans\". \"It didn't really work for me,\" Horner added. \"We have not really put on a show. \"To have Sebastian Vettel and Kimi Raikkonen in fast cars not taking part with five minutes to go is wrong.\" Rosberg was behind both Ferraris after the first runs in the final session, but he grabbed second on his final run ahead of Vettel and Raikkonen, who will start third and fourth respectively. The first race of the new season gets under way on Sunday at 05:00 GMT, with coverage on radio 5 live from 04:00 and online from 03:30. Rosberg said straight after the session: \"It's good to try something but it hasn't worked - so we should go back.\" Ferrari's Vettel, who qualified third but was able to change out of his overalls in time for the post-qualifying news conference because he did not run in the second part of the final session, said: \"I don't see why everyone is surprised it didn't work. \"It is a bit busier at the beginning of the session but for no reason. People want to see us pushing to the limit at the end of the session. It is the wrong way to go and that's what we said.\" The new format did work on one level, however. It made the first and second parts of the session more fraught - and one top team was caught out as Red Bull's Daniil Kvyat ended up 18th on the grid. Media playback is not supported on this device Hamilton was 0.838secs quicker than Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel, who was also 0.478secs behind Rosberg. The margin between the cars was such that Ferrari decided not to bother doing a second run in the final session of qualifying because they accepted they could not beat the Mercedes and preferred to save a set of tyres for the race. On the face of it, that suggests Mercedes are as far ahead of Ferrari as they were last year. But Hamilton was actually even further ahead of Vettel in qualifying in Australia last year and the German won the next race in Malaysia. Hamilton said: \"I really have to take my hat off to this team - what they have done to raise the bar once more. It inspires and motivates me. \"I enjoyed driving the car in qualifying, got the set-up just right. They were some sexy laps, beautiful rhythm, it felt so good. I felt like James Brown at the end of the lap.\" Vettel added: \"We expected them to be stronger in qualifying, which they were. Very happy with the lap in the end so we saved a set for the race. We still have high hopes for tomorrow and it is a long year.\" Toro Rosso's Max Verstappen and Carlos Sainz were fifth and seventh, split by Williams driver Felipe Massa. Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo and the Force Indias of Sergio Perez and Nico Hulkenberg completed the top 10. McLaren's Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button took 12th and 13th, a huge improvement on their dismal 2015, and Briton Jolyon Palmer 14th for Renault on his grand prix debut, ahead of team-mate and former McLaren driver Kevin Magnussen.

Its illustrious fans have included the Queen Mother, Margaret Thatcher and actors such as Cary Grant. But after the British firm was saved from administration in 2012, it has mainly focused on China and last year saw its UK sales fall 16%.

The unnamed acquirers have made a $5m down payment for exclusive rights to the deal, YGM said in its annual report this week. Chinese textile firm Shandong Ruyi Group is understood to be one of the buyers, according to Bloomberg. Aquascutum started as a Mayfair tailors in 1851, rising to prominence after its founder, John Emary, patented the first waterproof textile. Its trench coats were worn by British soldiers during the First World War, while in 1953 its wyncol fabric - designed to withstand 100 mph winds - was used by explorer Edmund Hillary in the first confirmed ascent of Mount Everest. The coats were also a regular feature on the silver screen, with Sean Connery wearing one in Another Time, Another Place in 1958 and Sophia Loren in The Key. However, the retailer has struggled in recent years, closing its Nottinghamshire factory in 2012 and then falling into administration. Under YGM's ownership, the company's primary focus has been China, with 135 of its 146 outlets located in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.

However, MacNiallais's second goal on 44 minutes put Donegal in firm control as Fermanagh's play became ragged. MacNiallais was perhaps fortunate to register the second goal after a superb move with his left foot appearing to be in the small square after taking a pass from Martin O'Reilly.

Donegal were leading 1-6 to 0-7 when the penalty was awarded after McGee had been red carded by Maurice Deegan for landing a retaliatory punch on Ruairi Corrigan after he had been fouled by the Fermanagh man. The missed penalty was the final play of the opening half as Donegal remained ahead at the break. Despite being a man down, Donegal took control in the second period as MacNiallais palmed to the net in the 44th minute following a sweeping move after a Fermanagh attack had broken down. Key Fermanagh defender Che Cullen, who had bossed a struggling Michael Murphy in open play in the first half, was black carded moments later and Donegal added a further three unanswered points to put the outcome beyond doubt. Ryan Jones had a goal chance with 10 minutes remaining which would have cut Donegal's lead to only four but his shot skimmed over the bar and with that, went Fermanagh's last chance to get back into the game. Media playback is not supported on this device MacNiallais' two goals came at crucial times - particularly his 44th-minute palmed effort - and he also picked a further point from play Late choice Eoin McHugh also shone for Donegal as he kicked two scores while Frank McGlynn must also have been a contender for the man of the match award as he produced several charges into opposition territory following turnovers. Martin O'Reilly was another strong-running presence for Rory Gallagher's side. Donegal manager Rory Gallagher: \"We were disappointed to lose Neil to a red card as he is one of our leaders. \"I felt we should have been more than two ahead at half-time but we dug ourselves out of it and now plan ahead for meeting Monaghan in the semi-finals.\" Fermanagh manager Pete McGrath: \"In the second half of the first half, we played exceptionally well.

WELSH LABOUR Labour have exceeded all expectations in Wales. They have outperformed every single Wales-only poll over the course of the campaign - and the exit poll - achieving their highest share of the vote in Wales since 1997. Not only did they successfully defend their 25 seats, but they gained three seats from the Conservatives, taking their total to 28 in Wales. This is their best performance in terms of seat share since 2005, and their best performance in terms of share of the Wales vote since the New Labour landslide of 1997. This extends their run of winning general elections in Wales to 26 in a row. WELSH CONSERVATIVES The Conservatives also saw their vote share increase across Wales by 6.3%, but this was not enough for them to hold off Labour's surge in Wales. Early in the night they were confident about gaining seats in Bridgend, Newport West and in the north east of Wales, so a net loss of 3 seats will be a big disappointment. Historically, the Conservatives have always performed worse in Wales than in England at every election going back to 1859, and this election looks to be no different. PLAID CYMRU It was a strange night for Plaid Cymru that ended in success with the election of their youngest ever MP, Ben Lake. They increased their parliamentary representation, taking Ceredigion from the Liberal Democrats, and their vote held up where they were defending the three seats won in 2015. Their group of four MPs is the party's largest Westminster cohort since the 2001 general election. Yet their vote share fell nationally by 1.7% and they lost votes in their other target seats of Ynys Mon, Llanelli and Rhondda. However, Plaid will view themselves as one of the few winners in this election on a night where smaller parties saw their vote share squeezed across the UK. LIBERAL DEMOCRATS The Liberal Democrats' torrid time at elections in Wales continues. They won their worst ever share of the vote in the party's history in Wales, and lost their solo MP Mark Williams in Ceredigion to Plaid Cymru. With only one AM in Wales, and limited representation in local government in Wales, the Liberal Democrats can no longer be considered to be a significant political player in the country. It is the first time since the founding of one of the Lib Dem's predecessor party, the Liberals, in 1859 that they will have no Westminster representation in Wales. UKIP UKIP's vote share has collapsed considerably across Wales, polling 11.6% less than 2015 after 38 constituencies had been called. Opinion polling across the campaign suggested that around two-thirds of the 2015 UKIP vote would go to the Conservatives. From the results we have seen so far, it seems that a significant proportion of these voters have voted for Labour in Wales.", "Thirty-two people died when the cruise ship hit rocks off the Tuscan island of Giglio in January 2012 and tipped on to its side. Capt Schettino was also convicted of causing the shipwreck and abandoning ship before his passengers, earning him the title \"Captain Coward\" in the Italian media. He has accepted some responsibility but denies the criminal charges, arguing that he has been made a scapegoat for the tragedy. While a prosecutor condemned him as a \"careless idiot\", Capt Schettino has long maintained his actions after the ship ran aground prevented a much greater loss of life. Born in 1960 in the southern coastal town of Castellammare di Stabia, near Naples, Capt Schettino has lived a life dominated by the sea. He attended a nautical institute in the nearby town of Piano di Sorrento and then joined Costa Cruises in 2002, initially as an official in charge of security. In 2006, he was promoted from second-in-command to captain. Costa Concordia: What happened Eyewitness accounts Salvaging the Costa Concordia Capt Schettino was singled out for blame by the official report into the sinking of the Costa Concordia, almost a floating city with its 4,300 passengers and crew members. It alleged he deliberately changed course to perform a risky night-time sail-past salute to people on the tiny island of Giglio. He told his trial he \"wanted to kill three birds with one stone\": to please the passengers, salute a retired captain on Giglio and do a favour to the vessel's head waiter, who was from the island. He has rejected rumours that he had wanted to impress his lover, Domnica Cemortan, with him at the helm. As details of the unplanned change of course emerged, ship owner Costa Cruises distanced itself from the captain who, it said, had made \"serious errors of judgement\" and carried out a manoeuvre \"unauthorised, unapproved and unknown to Costa\". The captain told the court that he had been been sacrificed to safeguard \"economic interests\", arguing that the court should be considering an entire organisation rather than one man. In a TV interview given hours after the ship ran aground, Mr Schettino's shock and disbelief was clear as he told reporters the rocks had not been shown on his charts. \"We were about 300 metres from the rocks, more or less, we shouldn't have hit anything.\" Widely vilified in Italy for leaving his ship while passengers were still on board, Capt Schettino's reputation was further damaged when transcripts suggested he had not told the coastguard initially of the gravity of the damage to the ship. \"Listen Schettino, perhaps you have saved yourself from the sea, but I will make you look very bad. I will make you pay for this. Dammit, go back on board!\" says Coastguard Capt Gregorio De Falco, repeatedly ordering him to return to the ship. Speaking by radio from a lifeboat, Capt Schettino said he was co-ordinating the rescue from there, pleading at one point: \"Do you realise that it is dark and we can't see anything?\" The coastguard shouts back: \"So, what do you want to do, to go home, Schettino?! It's dark and you want to go home? Go to the bow of the ship where the ladder is and tell me what needs to be done, how many people there are, and what they need! Now!\" A taxi driver who says he took the captain to a hotel the morning after the sinking said the captain had asked only where he could buy some socks. \"He looked like a beaten dog, cold and scared,\" the taxi driver said. Capt Schettino has accepted some degree of responsibility, asking for forgiveness in a television interview in 2012 as he talked of those who died. He said he blamed himself for being \"distracted\" but said that he had not been on the bridge when the ship ran aground. In the interview, he broke down when asked about the youngest of the 32 victims, a five-year-old girl. As the accusations against Capt Schettino grew, there were those who came to his defence, including sailors, who agreed with his assertion that his decision to steer the ship towards shallower waters had probably saved dozens of lives. His defence lawyers accused the prosecution of focusing on him while offering plea bargains to five co-defendants, jailed in July 2013 for up to two years and 10 months. According to an interview in Naples-based Il Mattino newspaper quoting his sister, the first person Capt Schettino called after the incident was his 80-year-old mother, Rosa. \"He called her at five in the morning on Saturday to tell her there had been a disaster, that he had tried to save as many passengers as possible and not to worry, because it was all over,\" she said. As he asked for a 26-year sentence, prosecutor Stefano Pizza listed all the mistakes Capt Schettino had made and said: \"May God have pity on Schettino, because we cannot.\"", "Joe Murphy's scrambled early goal was the ideal start for Down and they led 1-8 to 0-6 at half-time. With Caolan Mooney starring, the Mournemen extended their advantage to six midway through the second half. Meath reduced Down's lead but they home side held on after a nervous finish. Down went into the game propping up Division Two after disappointing opening defeats by Fermanagh and Clare. County secretary Sean Og McAteer felt compelled to release a length statement on Thursday night denying reports of unrest within Eamonn Burns' squad and Saturday's win will be a huge boost for the management. After hammering Derry at Navan two weeks ago, Meath were favourites heading into the Pairc Esler contest but the Mournemen produced a performance of grit and determination to chisel out the vital Division Two victory. Murphy's goal, as he flicked a mishit Darragh O'Hanlon free past Paddy O'Rourke, was the perfect start for the home side as they were never headed in the contest. With midfielder Peter Turley putting himself about and former under-age star Mooney producing his best game in the Down senior jersey, the home side pushed on from leading only 1-1 to 0-3 to move five ahead by the interval. O'Hanlon slotted three first-half frees while the impressive Conor Maginn, Barry O'Hagan (two), Ryan Johnston and Aidan Carr also got on the scoresheet for Down in the opening period. Fresh from his Sigerson Cup heroics with St Mary's, Kevin McKernan also excelled in the opening period for the Mournement as Meath laboured, with free-taker Donal Lenihan hitting three of their points. A McKernan point extended Down's lead to 1-11 to 0-8 by the 52nd minute after a great block at the other end by Carr had prevented Brian Menton for netting a Meath goal. After their struggles in recent times, it was not a surprise to see Down attempting to hold on to their lead in the closing stages and Meath, helped by the introduction of the speedy Eamonn Wallace, reduced the margin to three by the time the game entered injury time. Inevitably, there was a late scare for Down as Lenihan aimed for goal from his last-gasp 13-metre free and the ball skimmed off the crossbar over for a point before the final whistle was blown seconds later.

In 2012 Tower Hamlets Council decided against selling the piece after strong criticism. The council said it would be positioned in Canary Wharf from October. The Henry Moore Foundation's director Godfrey Worsdale said the foundation was \"very pleased\" the piece was \"returning to Tower Hamlets after a careful and rigorous process\". Yorkshire Sculpture Park said it was \"working closely with Tower Hamlets, following [current] Mayor John Biggs' manifesto pledge to return the sculpture to London\". Mr Biggs' predecessor, Lutfur Rahman, was removed from office after he was found guilty of electoral fraud in his 2014 election. In 2012 Mr Rahman said it was necessary to sell the Moore sculpture - known as Old Flo - which was believed to be worth about \u00c2\u00a320m, because of \"unprecedented\" budget cuts. Moore, a well-known socialist, sold the cast at cost price, \u00c2\u00a37,400, to the former London County Council on the understanding it would be displayed in a public space and might enrich the lives of those living in a socially deprived area. The Tate Gallery described it as \"part of a post-war revival of civil aspirations and social reform\". An open letter, written in 2012 by the sculptor's daughter Mary Moore and others, including film director Danny Boyle and the Tate's Sir Nicholas Serota, said selling the piece was \"against the spirit of Henry Moore's original sale to London County Council at a favourable price on the understanding that it would be placed in east London\". 1961 Stifford Estate, accommodating about 1,700 people, is completed 1962 Draped Seated Woman is purchased by London County Council and later placed on the estate 1997 The sculpture is loaned to Yorkshire Sculpture Park 1999 Stifford Estate is demolished 2012 Lutfur Rahman announces he wants to sell the sculpture, worth about \u00c2\u00a320m 2015 The High Court confirms Tower Hamlets Council is the legal owner of the sculpture after a dispute with Bromley Council which began in 2012 2017 Sculpture's return to London announced.", "They were followed by announcements from skin care firm Syneron-Candela and Japanese mattress maker Airweave. It comes after Lochte lied about being robbed at gunpoint by a policeman after a night out during the Rio Olympics. Lochte, a 12-time Olympic medalist, has earned millions of dollars through endorsements. Speedo, the biggest sponsor of the four, said: \"We cannot condone behaviour that is counter to the values this brand has long stood for.\" Lochte, aged 32, said he respected Speedo's decision, and thanked the company. \"I am grateful for the opportunities that our partnership has afforded me over the years,'' he said. Speaking on US talk show Today, Lochte said: \"I made a mistake and I definitely learned from this. They put on a great Games... and my immature, intoxicated behaviour tarnished that a little.\" Ralph Lauren, which has removed some of Lochte's images from its website, said its sponsorship of the swimmer had been only for the Rio Olympics and would not be renewed. Ralph Lauren and Airweave both stressed that they would continue their support of the US Olympic and Paralympic teams. Syneron-Candela said: \"We hold our employees to high standards, and we expect the same of our business partners.'' Speedo said it would donate a $50,000 portion of Lochte's sponsorship fee to the charity Save The Children's Brazilian operation. The value of Lochte's Speedo sponsorship has not been disclosed. The contract reportedly expires this year after 10 years. The US business magazine Forbes calculated that in the year of the 2012 London Olympics, Lochte earned about $2m in sponsorships from companies such as Gillette, Nissan, AT&T and Gatorade. Lochte's performance at Rio did not reach the heights of his London triumph, but Forbes estimated his endorsements would still have been between $1m-$2m. The saga started when Lochte and three team-mates returned to the Olympic village after a late night out in Rio. They tried, unsuccessfully, to use the locked toilet at a garage and urinated outside instead. After first claiming that he and his three team-mates had been robbed by bogus policemen, Lochte back-tracked and admitted he had, while still drunk, \"left details out\" and \"over-exaggerated some parts of the story\". Despite the evidence against him, including CCTV footage, he has however denied that he actually lied in his initial account to Brazilian police. Lochte's behaviour has been met with disdain in the US and he has been widely pilloried in the US media. On 19 August the New York Post carried a front-page headline describing him as the \"Ugly American\", along with the slogan \"Liar, Liar, Speedo on fire\". Lochte is one of the most successful swimmers in history, with 12 Olympic medals, and he once had his own reality television show in the US. In Rio, he swam in two events, winning a gold medal in the 4x200m freestyle relay along with team-mate Jack Conger. \"We appreciate his many achievements and hope he moves forward and learns from this experience,\" Speedo said of Lochte.", "The BBC has seen a copy of the document, which is due to be formally signed off on Thursday. It contains policies on nationalising railways and renewing the Trident weapons system and suggests Labour will not leave the EU without a deal. Labour would not comment on the leak but the Tories called it \"a shambles\". According to the draft, Labour would: On energy, Labour would have at least one publicly-owned supplier in every region of the country, with the government controlling the transmission and distribution grids. First it would introduce an \"immediate emergency price cap\" of \u00a31,000 a year. The manifesto still has to be approved by around 80 Labour figures, including the shadow cabinet and the party's National Executive Committee. The final version will form the foundation of Labour's pitch to voters on the 8 June general election. A spokesman for Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: \"We do not comment on leaks. We will announce our policies in our manifesto, which is our plan to transform Britain for the many, not the few.\" The draft document is seen by some senior Labour figures as the most left-wing manifesto since the party was led by Michael Foot in 1983. It certainly appears to be the most detailed in a generation with a 20-point plan for workers' rights alone. Many individual policies are likely to be popular - not every privatisation is seen as having been a success and polling suggests the commitments to renationalise the railways and cap energy prices aren't as controversial as critics would claim But opponents and sceptical voters will await further detail behind the assertion that everything has been costed. Privately, many Labour MPs believe Jeremy Corbyn will get the manifesto he wants but in return he must take full responsibility if voters find it less appealing than he does . Many of the policies have been previously announced by Labour or were proposed by Mr Corbyn during his successful leadership campaign. These include banning fracking, and the draft manifesto also says nuclear power would continue to be supported. On welfare, Labour says it would scrap benefit sanctions and the so-called \"bedroom tax\" and restore housing benefit for people aged under 21. The triple lock protecting the state pension would be maintained, and the retirement age would not increase beyond 66. The draft was initially leaked to the Mirror and the Daily Telegraph. A Conservative spokesman said: \"This is a total shambles. Jeremy Corbyn's plans to unleash chaos on Britain have been revealed. \"The commitments in this dossier will rack up tens of billions of extra borrowing for our families and will put Brexit negotiations at risk.\" In other general election news, the Conservatives are pledging to continue meeting the Nato target of spending 2% of GDP on defence. Prime Minister Theresa May said she was also extending by two years a pledge to increase the defence budget by at least 0.5% above inflation annually. Labour is also promising to meet the 2% Nato pledge.", "The name is expressed with affection by some, with hostility by others, but it calls up history for everyone. The story of his life is very much the story of our times: revolutionary movements, the Cold War, East v West, North v South, communism v capitalism - except that most of the world has passed him by. Fidel Castro has remained the same, a symbol of revolution, a communist who has survived the fall of communism. Before surgery took him out of public view in July 2006, he inspired his followers with slogans and five-hour speeches. Fidel's views continued to be made public though in the form of editorials and occasional TV appearances. Fidel maintained his rule with an iron grip, sending opponents to prison for years. Throughout his leadership, he railed against the US, its economic and trade embargo and against the evils of free markets Fidel has been praised for standing up for the oppressed of Latin America, for opposing the Yankee imperialist, for making Cuba into a more equal society than many, for developing Cuba's health service and sending doctors abroad to help others. And it wasn't only doctors he sent abroad. He despatched troops to Angola and Ethiopia in support of fellow revolutionaries. His hand was seen in many a revolutionary movement in his own continent. But he has also been condemned for intolerance, for keeping his people poor and for refusing to see the benefits of economic liberalisation that even the communists of China have embraced. Fidel Castro stopped his people from leaving the island, leading them to risk their lives in rickety boats to try to get out. At one stage in the early years of the Reagan administration he was accused of trying to take over Central America for the Soviet Union by revolution. Washington at that time saw a path that led from the guerrillas of El Salvador through Nicaragua to Cuba and right up to the door of the Kremlin. Cuban assistance to the small and then revolutionary island of Grenada in the Caribbean prompted a full-scale US invasion. Throughout his rule, President Castro remained in almost permanent confrontation with the United States - and it with him. The American embargo on Cuba has been used by both sides - as a policy by the US to isolate Cuba and as an excuse by Fidel Castro for the island's poverty. US President Barack Obama and Castro's successor as president, younger brother Raul, announced a thawing in relations in 2015 but the embargo remains in place. When Mr Obama visited earlier this year - the first by a US leader in more than half a century - Castro remained defiant, saying Cuba did not need any gifts from the \"empire\" in a damning letter. He cut a giant figure on the world stage during the 47 years he controlled Cuba - at one point bringing the US and the Soviet Union to the brink of nuclear war. It was the Cuban missile crisis of 1962 that propelled him into worldwide prominence. Before that he had been just a glamorous revolutionary leader. He had overthrown the dictator Batista in a classic guerrilla war and had fought off an American-led invasion by Cuban exiles on the Bay of Pigs in 1961. But when Nikita Khrushchev decided, with Fidel Castro's agreement, to station nuclear missiles in Cuba itself, the island leader turned from being a thorn in the side of the Americans into being a mortal threat. It was only the skilled diplomacy of Jack Kennedy (and of Khrushchev in the end) that saved the day, and Fidel's own island from destruction. The then-US defence Secretary Robert McNamara met President Castro in 1992. He said the Cuban leader told him there were 162 nuclear missiles in Cuba at the time of the crisis. He asked Castro if he had recommended they be used. The answer was: \"Yes, I did.\" \"And what would have happened to Cuba?\" Mr McNamara asked him. \"It would have been destroyed.\" Fidel Castro was not part of the diplomacy that ended the missile crisis. But he came out of the crisis remarkably strengthened. Kennedy promised that the US would not invade Cuba, a promise that has held. The CIA made efforts to get rid of him with bizarre plots involving the Mafia and poison. They came to nothing. President Castro's people took immense precautions to protect him from potential harm from food and drink, as diplomats who invite him to their receptions in Havana found out. He survived harm from his enemies. And whatever happens to Cuba after him, the name of Fidel will survive in history.", "Sadiq Khan claimed expanding the West Sussex airport was \"the only option that can actually be delivered\". His letter to Theresa May was signed by 30 cross-party London MPs, council leaders and London Assembly members. It claimed a second runway at Gatwick would be the \"obvious choice\" for the capital and Britain. \"Gatwick would not only require no public subsidy - a huge factor in our current uncertain economic times - but would give Britain all the benefits of expansion whilst keeping our air quality safe and within legal limits,\" Mr Khan said. In her keynote address to the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, Mrs May confirmed that the government would \"shortly announce\" which airport would get the go-ahead. The shortlisted options being considered are a third runway at Heathrow, extending its existing northern runway and a second runway at Gatwick.", "Wolverhampton City Council said in 2014 the authority faced the prospect of \"becoming insolvent\", unless it made \"very deep and very fast cuts\". The Labour-run council approved plans on Wednesday to cut a number of services, including neighbourhood wardens, and increase council tax. However, unions said they feared service standards would drop. The council said the scale of cuts it would need to make by 2019 had risen to \u00a3134m - an increase on the \u00a3123m it predicted in 2014. The authority said this was \"largely due\" to the rising costs of children's services, pay and pensions, and continuing government cuts. In 2014, it announced it would have to cut 1,400 jobs and make massive service reductions or it would be down to its last \u00a3620,000 and \"bankrupt shortly after\". Cabinet member for resources Andrew Johnson said: \"We are now realistically looking at the prospect of becoming insolvent unless we make cuts.\" The council said it had moved on \"dramatically\" since that announcement. \"This no longer reflects where we are,\" it said, in a statement. \"The council has made it abundantly clear that it will do what was required to balance the books.\" However, Wendy Thompson, leader of the Conservative group, said the authority had simply pushed its debt repayments back to give itself some \"breathing space\". \"That's they only way they are staving off this situation,\" she said. \"Their priorities over the years have been 'spend, spend, spend'. It's an unhappy situation for Wolverhampton. Our poor residents have a city centre that has so much dereliction and so many empty shops. \"We desperately need to turn the city around.\" On Wednesday, the council agreed to axe the neighbourhood wardens service, despite a 4,500-signature petition from the public, and raise council tax by 1.99%. Council leader Roger Lawrence said: \"The savage cuts from central government that continue to unfairly target areas like Wolverhampton have made it impossible to continue to offer the level of services the city deserves.\" Nick Keleher, secretary of the TUC in Wolverhampton, said the wardens did a \"very useful job\". \"The petition forced a debate in the council but now it is intending to cut the service despite the public campaign,\" he said. \"A lot of services have already been cut or transferred to the private sector. \"I have seen colleagues who have lost their jobs with the council move into the private sector. They have been very disappointed with the standards.\" The government said: \"Every bit of the public sector needs to do its bit to pay off deficit left by the last administration, including local government.\" It said Wolverhampton's spending had increased during its time in office.", "Japan should learn \"profound lessons from history\", China's defence ministry said after Japan's parliamentary vote. The vote allows Japanese troops to fight overseas for the first time since the end of World War Two 70 years ago. Tensions between China and Japan have escalated in recent months over a group of islands to which both lay claim. The security laws were voted through Japan's upper house late on Friday, with 148 lawmakers voting in support and 90 against. It followed nearly 200 hours of political wrangling, with scuffles breaking out at various points between the bills' supporters and opposition members attempting to delay the vote. Compiled by BBC Monitoring The government says that the changes in defence policy are vital to meet new military challenges such as those posed from a rising China. But China's defence ministry said on Saturday they \"run counter to the trend of the times that upholds peace, development and co-operation\", the Xinhua news agency reports. \"The move has breached the restrictions of Japan's pacifist constitution,\" the ministry added. Many Japanese who opposed the bills - which prompted large public protests - were also attached to the pacifist provisions in the constitution that banned fighting overseas. China also urged Japan to \"heed the security concern\" of its Asian neighbours and do more to promote regional peace and stability. South Korea, which also has a tense relationship with Japan, has warned Tokyo not to exercise the new defence laws without its approval. But the US, Japan's ally, and the UK have both welcomed the changes. UK Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said he looked forward to Japan \"taking an increasingly active part in peacekeeping operations\". Japan's post-World War Two constitution bars it from using force to resolve international conflicts except in cases of self-defence. The new security legislation allows Japan's military to mobilise overseas when these three conditions are met: What's behind Japan's military shift? Critics say the changes violate the pacifist constitution and could lead Japan into US-led wars abroad. Supporters of the measures insist they are essential for the defence of Japan and its regional allies, and will permit greater involvement in peacekeeping activities around the world. Critics have focused on what they say is ambiguity in how the principles of the legislation will be interpreted, and the possibility that future governments will interpret them more broadly.", "Laurence Shahlaei, originally from Cheltenham, took the title in Leeds from two-time title holder Hafthor Bjornsson who is also famed for his role in the popular television series. Mr Shahlaei, nicknamed \"Big Loz\", said: \"He's a great strongman but it was my day and it felt really good to win.\" The 32-year-old is the first Englishman to win the title in 27 years. Standing at 6ft 2in (1.9m) and weighing 22 stone (145 kg), the Wiltshire-based athlete had to overcome injury last weekend to take the crown. \"I've had a rough few years with injuries and to come back and win Europe's Strongest man has just meant the world to me,\" he said. \"There's five different events that you have to do. I did a 420 kilo dead lift, which was good enough for joint second and then we did a frame carry - it's a race and you're running a 20-metre course while carrying 450 kilos, which is close to 90 stone, and I won that event.\" Competitors also had to lift a 177kg (28 stone) block above their heads \"as many times as possible\" as well as tackling the infamous Atlas stones - an event synonymous with strongman competitions. But it was running 20m (65ft) with a Volkswagen Beetle on his shoulders in around 11 seconds that clinched the title from Iceland's Hafthor Bjornsson. \"My favourite of the competition was the car walk.  Imagine Fred Flintstone running in his car - that was basically me,\" he said. \"I actually broke the world record on that event.  They made the car even heavier this year and I managed over a second off my world record - which was really, really good.\"", "U's captain Leon Legge struck what proved to be the decisive goal after 29 minutes, powering a header beyond Christy Pym from Piero Mingoia's free-kick. Exeter had earlier spurned a glorious chance to go ahead when Joel Grant blazed over after Ollie Watkins' shot was deflected into his path in space. Luke Berry almost made it 2-0 six minutes before half-time when a kick from goalkeeper Will Norris ran all the way through to him, only for his effort to land on the roof of the net before Norris produced a magnificent point-blank save to keep out Reuben Reid's header. Needing a result to solidify their own play-off spot, Exeter saw a Grant effort blocked by Legge and Lee Holmes volleyed well wide when a clearance fell to him. Eleven minutes from the end Norris made another critical save to parry a header from the unmarked David Wheeler to preserve the lead for Cambridge, who are a point from the top seven.

It is the Gunners' last chance of a trophy this season. Wenger could field as many as five British players - Aaron Ramsey, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Theo Walcott, Kieran Gibbs and Rob Holding - but he says a player's nationality is less important to him than \"players who integrate the values of the club\" and are \"ready to defend these values\". \"A lot is said about my future but my future is more important in the value and spirit of what we have built in 20 years than my own person,\" added the 67-year-old Frenchman. In the opposite dugout, Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola has happy memories of Wembley as both a player and a manager with Barcelona. The Spaniard was a member of the Barca side who won the European Cup at the ground in 1992 and he was manager when the side beat Manchester United 3-1 in the Champions League final in 2011. Guardiola said: \"Wembley in my life has been so important in terms of football. We were able to win the first Champions League when Ronald Koeman made a fantastic goal against the Sampdoria of Roberto Mancini. \"The second one, we beat one of the best teams in the world in Manchester United at Wembley and, especially the way we played, always I will remember in my heart. \"Wembley is an important part of my life.

The New York firm told the BBC that the vulnerability had since been fixed. But a security researcher said he had previously warned the firm about security weaknesses. Topps declined to say how many people were affected or why the payment card numbers were at risk. In most hack attacks, companies assure users that they do not store such financial data in a form that can be exposed. In an email to customers Topps wrote that on 12 October \"one or more intruders gained unauthorised access\" to its systems. \"[They] may have gained access to names, addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, credit or debit card numbers, card expiration dates and card verification numbers for customers [who made purchases] between approximately 30 July 2016 and 12 October 2016,\" it added. It is offering one year's worth of free identify theft protection to those affected. Various customers have posted the email on social media and it is also available on the Sports Collectors Daily website. Topps is part-owned by a fund belonging to Michael Eisner, the former chief executive of Disney. \"The really unforgivable aspect here is the loss of credit card details,\" said cyber-security expert Prof Alan Woodward from Surrey University. \"If this was an external attack, these details just should not be accessible or readable. An obvious question is, was the customers financial data encrypted? \"If not that should attract some heavy attention from the appropriate regulators.\" Chris Vickery, a security researcher from Chromatech blogged in June about exposed databases of customer accounts with three of Topps' mobile apps: Bunt, Huddle, and Kick. He wrote that it was fixed.

Meanwhile, the \"volatility index\" - a measure of investors' uncertainty - has hit levels last seen in the 2008 financial crisis. The Leave campaign argued that the pound simply retreated to March levels. The pound was down 0.2% against the dollar at $1.4226. Against the euro, sterling was down 0.6% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.2605 and weakened by 1% against the Japanese yen to just over 151. Investors have been spooked by data showing the chances of a Remain vote have fallen, although markets have also been rattled by global economic worries. With 10 days to go before the referendum vote, two polls at the weekend put the Leave camp ahead, while betting firm Betfair said the implied probability of a vote to Remain had now fallen to 68.5% from almost 80% a week earlier.

Joe Rundle, head of trading at ETX Capital, said the markets were now on full Brexit alert. \"Polls show it's now too close to call and markets are responding with some very twitchy activity. Sterling has shed more than 2% in two sessions to retrace its April lows.\" Worries about the economic impact of leaving the EU were also blamed for a big fall in Asian stock markets. Japan's Nikkei index closed 3.5% down, while Hong Kong's main index slid 2.5%. The reaction on London's FTSE 100 was muted initially, with the index down 0.3% in morning trading. However, the FTSE 100 ended the day down 1.1% at 6,044.9 points, with Lloyds Banking Group the biggest faller, down 4.2%. On Sunday, Leave campaigner Nigel Farage told BBC1's Andrew Marr Show that sterling had recently been strengthening. \"Sterling is up since March. Since Brexit became a possibility, sterling is up and FTSE is exactly the same level it was in March,\" he said. He also pointed out that a weaker pound was good for UK exporters. Last week, official figures showed that the UK trade deficit narrowed in April on the back of a jump in exports.", "The 30-year-old looked relaxed while sitting on the 3.1m (10ft) crocodile, removed from a trap in Darwin Harbour. The pictures, which also show him hauling in the catch, were released by the Parks and Wildlife Commission Northern Territory. Meanwhile, the prince has completed an eight-day tour of New Zealand. Wildlife ranger Erin Britton said the prince would make \"a great croc catcher\" and said he did a \"great job\" helping the crocodile management team in the removal of the crocodile. Bess Price, minister for parks and wildlife, said it was a \"top secret mission\" that would leave \"a unique lasting impression\" of the Northern Territory with Prince Harry.

Recalled fast bowler Kyle Abbott (3-23) and spinner Dane Piedt (4-101) were the only South African wicket takers. Piedt, 25, playing just his second Test, took four of the first five wickets to fall, including that of Kohli whose fluent 70-run stand with Rahane was ended in bizarre fashion. The India captain, who won the toss for a fourth time, smashed a full-blooded sweep into Temba Bavuma at short-leg and after the ball ballooned into the air, wicketkeeper Dane Vilas dived forward to take the catch. That sparked a mini collapse with three wickets falling for three runs before Rahane, who hit two sixes and nine boundaries in his first half century at home, steadied the innings and took India beyond 200.

Metrobus admits public subsidies might now have to be used to entice firms on board. The first of the new bus routes are due to be completed in the next few months. David Redgewell, from passenger group Bus Users UK, said the lack of a current operator was a worry. \"We need to be realistic about what the bus industry can deliver in hard times,\" he said. \"The buses have to make money, so there's really going to have to be realism amongst the public authorities that unless they are prepared to put public subsidy in then they [buses] need to be commercial.\" In March 2015, Bristol City Council was required to spend more than \u00a31m removing protestors from Stapleton allotments, part of the new Metrobus route. Former secretary of Stapleton Allotments Association, Jane Ghosh, said she was \"absolutely shocked but not the least bit surprised\". \"It's cost \u00a3200 million plus, it's a lot more than that because of the delays. They only have \u00a334 million from the government, which is static and won't go up,\" she said. \"We told them right at the beginning, this was never going to be a commercially viable project - but nobody listened to us.\" BBC Radio Bristol politics reporter Pete Simson Could Bristol really be left with a brand new public transport network, but no company willing to run it? The idea was always for Metrobus to be run without subsidies, using shiny new buses with clean fuel. Unfortunately, it would appear bus companies view this as simply too risky, after all, they want to make a profit. With huge swathes of Bristol's roads currently being dug up to build Metrobus, the need for a deal becomes ever more pressing. Time will tell if this is merely another teething problem, or a hugely costly mistake. Commuters are currently enduring roadworks associated with the scheme in the city centre, on the M32 and various other locations in South Gloucestershire. The scheme was devised by the West of England Partnership (WEP), an alliance between the four councils in Bristol, Bath, South Gloucestershire and North Somerset. It involves three routes: Ashton Vale to Temple Meads, Cribbs Causeway via Emersons Green to the city centre and the South Bristol link between the A370 Long Ashton bypass and Hengrove Park. It will provide an express bus service on 31 miles (50km) of segregated bus-ways and bus lanes. The WEP said Bristol, South Gloucestershire and North Somerset council were \"actively negotiating\" with bus operators and such discussions were commercially sensitive. A spokeswoman said: \"We have always been clear that the aim is that the MetroBus services are run entirely on a commercial basis via a quality partnership scheme that sets minimum standards for frequencies, quality of vehicles and maximum fares, supported by a voluntary partnership agreement with one or more operator. \"Of course should negotiations not be successful, we have a range of back up plans which could include formal contracts to run all or some services on a contracted basis. \"This might require the use of public money following a competitive procurement process, but this would depend on the situation when negotiations conclude - which all parties agree should be in about three-four weeks' time.\" First Bus, Wessex and the Bath Bus Company RAPT were said to be in the running for the contract.", "If you were sold PPI via your credit card then the differences can amount to thousands of pounds. This is because of the way some credit card providers interpret the regulatory guidelines. \"It's becoming a bit of a lottery,\" personal finance expert Jonquil Lowe told BBC Radio 4's Moneybox programme. \"The amount of redress you get depends on which provider you happen to have your credit card with,\" said Ms Lowe, who is a lecturer in personal finance at the Open University. These differences emerged last year when Martin Baker, managing director of the Swindon-based claims management company Renaissance Easy Claim, began challenging redress offers from MBNA, an American-based credit card provider whose cards are extensively marketed in the UK. Mr Baker noticed that MBNA's compensation offers to his clients appeared to be significantly lower than he would have expected from the high street banks. One client, Mark Pascoe, was offered \u00a35,800 in compensation by MBNA. Had his card been with a high street bank, Mr Baker estimates he would have received more than \u00a313,000. Mr Baker now has around 1,000 MBNA compensation clients on his books. \"In a sample of our cases,\" Mr Baker told the BBC's Moneybox programme, \"we found 80% were due more if MBNA paid according to the way the high street banks pay.\" On average, MBNA's redress offers amount to around half what high street banks would award on the same credit card history, he said. Capital One, another American credit card provider, \"adopts a very similar approach to MBNA, with similar results,\" said Mr Baker. So how do such differences arise? When compensating for mis-sold PPI, regulators require card providers to put customers back into the financial position they would have been in if they had never had PPI at all. Each card provider is free to establish its own methodology for calculating redress, within overall regulatory guidelines. A key difference arises when a cardholder occasionally pays off their monthly card balance in full. To calculate the compensation owing, banks have to reconstruct a customer's credit card history, removing mis-sold PPI premiums, fees and charges that premiums triggered - for exceeding a card's credit limit, for example - and any interest charged on those payments. With these PPI charges removed the monthly amounts owing are lower. So when card-holders pay off what was their original monthly balance - they have overpaid according to their reconstructed card history. The differing treatment of such overpayments is a major cause of the differences in compensation offers, argues Martin Baker. While high street banks treat an overpayment as a temporary credit to be set against future spending on a customer's card - MBNA and Capital One treat it as a permanent loan from the customer to themselves lasting for the lifetime of the card, he says. It may sound a technicality, but it can have a significant impact on compensation. Because while regulators require card providers to pay customers 8% interest on such loans, that's far less than the amount MBNA and Capital One charge customers on their card borrowings. Martin Baker describes this as a \"systemic flaw\" in MBNA and Capital One's methodology. Earlier this year, the BBC asked regulators if they thought MBNA and Capital One's methodologies fell within the official rules and guidelines. The Financial Conduct Authority told the BBC they did not accept that there was \"a systemic flaw\" in the calculations. The Financial Ombudsman said in the cases they were seeing, \"card providers were fairly compensating consumers, taking into account the FCA's guidance and the Ombudsman's approach\". To work out how two such very different compensation methodologies could both seemingly be deemed acceptable by regulators, Moneybox commissioned an independent review of MBNA's calculations from the Open University's Jonquil Lowe. After a detailed analysis of MBNA's methodology Ms Lowe found it differed substantially from the regulatory guidance most banks follow. How much difference that makes to compensation, she says, will vary from case to case. Ms Lowe says regulatory guidelines do allow banks to make assumptions about what customers might have done had they not had PPI on their credit cards which include assumptions about how banks treat overpayments in their card reconstructions. But because these assumptions can have so big an impact on compensation over time, Ms Lowe says they need careful monitoring. \"If an alternative method is used, it has to be appropriate and fair, given the individual circumstances of the case. \"The onus has to be on MBNA to say why its method is fairer and more appropriate than the method set out by the regulator and used, in most cases, by the Ombudsman.\" Both MBNA and Capital One declined to be interviewed by the BBC, or to say why they claim the assumptions in their calculations are appropriate. In a statement, MBNA said its calculations were developed in line with the FCA's guidance, and based on how the Financial Ombudsman would expect them to look at individual cases. Of Jonquil Lowe's conclusions it said: \"Jonquil Lowe's report sets out how she assumes the FOS might deal with MBNA's cases, based on her theoretical interpretation of general guidance. Our aim is to put customers back in the situation they would have been in, had they not taken a PPI product.\" Capital One said it assessed every case on its individual circumstances and is in frequent contact with the Financial Ombudsman Service to ensure its calculations were \"fair and accurate\". Meanwhile, regulators continue to stress that any customer who is unhappy with a redress offer can always appeal to the Financial Ombudsman for a ruling. Given the complexity of the calculations behind the offers, however, Jonquil Lowe doubts the practicality of that advice. \"It took me 80 hours to unravel what was going on [and] I've got a lot of technical expertise. \"The average consumer could not, I think, reconstruct their accounts in the way that I have done. Not least because the information they get along with their redress is usually not detailed enough for them to be able to make that kind of check. \"It is extremely hard for consumers to know whether they had a fair redress, or not.\" With that in mind, Andrew Tyrie MP, the newly re-elected Chair of the influential House of Commons Treasury Select Committee said: \"We'll actually be keeping a very close eye on this in the weeks and months ahead. \"We've been working very hard to get a decent level of address on PPI for a long time and we're certainly not going to let go of the subject until we're satisfied a correct and decent amount of compensation is being paid.\"", "Glyndwr University is hosting the first meeting of the North Wales Cyber Security Cluster with local businesses also attending. Prof Vic Grout said the aim is to meet monthly to share good practice.

Deradicalisation classes will be made mandatory for others deemed a threat. But Muslim leaders warned the strategy \"continues down a flawed path\" and risks \"alienating\" Muslims in the UK. Also among the measures within the counter-extremism strategy are: Prime Minister David Cameron said the plan would work because it was \"comprehensive\" . \"It's no good leaving this simply to the police or the intelligence services. It's no good simply talking about violent extremism. We need to confront all extremism,\" he said. He said its effectiveness would be measured by whether people were being turned away from extremism, stopped from travelling to fight for IS, and by having \"more cohesive and integrated communities\". Home Secretary Theresa May said non-violent extremism could not go \"uncontested\" as it led to the erosion of women's rights, the spread of intolerance and bigotry and the separation of some communities \"from the mainstream\". She said that applied to neo-Nazi extremism just as much as Islamist doctrine. The Muslim Council of Britain has released a highly-critical statement in response to the plans. Secretary general Dr Shuja Shafi said the strategy would \"reinforce perceptions that all aspects of Muslim life must undergo a 'compliance' test to prove our loyalty to this country\". \"These measures could be seen more as a means to address the anxieties a minority of people may have against Muslims and their religious life, rather than the scourge of terrorism itself,\" he said. Dr Shafi also said he detected \"McCarthyist undertones\" in the plans to create blacklists and exclude and ban people those deemed to be extremists. Mr Mohammed Shafiq, chief executive of the Ramadhan Foundation, said the announcement was a \"missed opportunity to really engage the Muslim community\". But Fiyaz Mughal, director of the interfaith Faith Matters organisation, said there was much in the plans that could \"help in the battle against those who promote extremism\". Robin Brant, BBC political correspondent At the heart of this considerable strategy on counter extremism are two significant challenges for the prime minister: the internet and the law. Getting inciteful content off the web and getting \"counter narrative\" content up there is key to harnessing the full potential of a medium that IS has already mastered. There has been much focus on the mosques but bedroom radicalisation is something the prime minister and MI5 worry intensely about. The process of trying to persuade Facebook, Twitter and other social media giants to help is ongoing. On the second point, the plans to introduce new powers to restrict what extremists can do and where they can go are still in their legal infancy. The government concedes they will need to be properly targeted. It is still consulting with lawyers and community groups to try to get the balance right. Police estimate at least 700 people from the UK have travelled to support or fight for jihadist organisations in Syria and Iraq, such as the so-called Islamic State, and the government believes tackling non-violent extremism is key to stemming the flow of people. Parents of children aged under 16 have had the power to request the cancellation of passports - even where a child has taken or hidden the actual document - since July. That power is being extended to parents of 16 and 17-year-olds, allowing families to contact a passport office where officials will investigate their concerns before a final decision is taken by the home secretary. Mrs May said the measure had only been used by \"a small number\" of parents since July, but it was part of a package of new powers that would help tackle extremism. Shadow policing minister Jack Dromey said it was \"crucial we get the balance right\" and that Mr Cameron must \"be very careful not to use the language he used earlier in the summer that somehow the Muslim community is not standing up to terrorism\". Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said the announcements amounted to \"rhetoric that may well divide communities and make our job of working with those communities to find and isolate terrorists and potential terrorists that much harder\".", "Around 155 countries are expected to formally sign the deal at the UN, setting in motion events that could see the treaty operational within a year. The UN says the expected record turnout for the signing shows overwhelming global support for tackling rising temperatures. But some environmentalists have dismissed the event as a \"distraction\". Despite the absence of President Obama, around 60 world leaders are expected here at UN headquarters, including French President Francois Hollande and Prime Minister Trudeau from Canada. But their signatures alone will not be enough to make the Paris agreement operational. The legal requirements  mean that each country will have to go through a process of ratification. For some this will require nothing more than the assent of the political leader as in the example of the United States. Others though, such as India and Japan, will have to take the document to their parliaments; some may need new laws. The European Union is expected to lag behind on this issue as it has not yet agreed with the 28 member states on how emissions cuts will be shared out. Each member state will also have to ratify the deal individually. Some countries, including the Marshall Islands, Palau, Fiji and Switzerland, have already completed this step and will be able to formally join the agreement on April 22. To become operational, the treaty needs at least 55 countries representing at least 55% of global emissions to complete all the steps. While this is a tough threshold to reach an unusual coalition of interests is making it possible. Firstly President Obama is keen to ensure the deal is operational before his successor takes office next January. If the next President wants to take the US out of an established treaty they will have to wait for four years - by which time they may no longer be in charge. Many of the least developed countries are pushing forward as well because a clerical error in the drafting of the new agreement means it becomes operational as soon at it hits the 55/55 mark, and not in 2020 as many people had supposed. Poorer countries fear that if the threshold is reached they could be left out in the cold if they haven't ratified, meaning they would not be able to influence the rules and organisation of the new deal. \"There was a little buzz a few weeks back with someone suggesting that some of the smaller counties should refrain from signing, in order to get a better deal,\" explained Reid Detchon from the United Nations Foundation. \"The fact that there is this large number of developing [countries] that are coming to the table here says that argument hasn't taken root and they really saw how deeply their own national self interest was bound up in success here.\" Scientists and analysts are also keen on a speedy implementation of the agreement for different reasons. According to a new study by researchers at Chatham House, leaving any increase in the level of carbon cutting ambition until 2025 as detailed in the Paris deal would make it nigh on impossible to keep temperatures below 2 degrees C, never mind 1.5. \"For the Paris agreement to have any credibility we can't afford to wait ten years in order to increase ambition,\" said Shane Tomlinson, a senior research fellow at Chatham House. \"Estimates suggest that the gap between where emissions will be and where they need to be, will be around 11 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide in 2025. That's more than the annual emissions of China,\" he added. Reid Detchon agreed on the need for urgency and increased ambition. But he was worried that global leaders didn't quite understand that getting agreement in Paris was, in some ways, the easy bit. \"My biggest concern really is that we are only on the first step of a ladder of increased ambition. It is going to become clear to the world over the next 3 -5 years how much more we need to do to stabilise the climate.\" Some environmentalists and indigenous leaders believe the whole process is not worth the paper it is written on. According to the International Alliance of Frontline Communities, the Paris Agreement is a \"dangerous distraction\" from the real issues. \"I started attending the UN climate meetings in 1999. Over the last 17 years I've witnessed corporate, Wall Street and other financial influence gut any real solutions coming out of the negotiations,\" said Tom Goldtooth, of the Indigenous Environmental Network, in a statement. \"As a result, the Paris Agreement goal of stopping global temperature rise by 1.5 degrees C is not real because the pledges each country is making will allow emission levels that will increase global temperature 3 - 4 degrees.  This will be catastrophic to the ecosystem of the world.\" Follow Matt on Twitter @MattMcGrathBBC and on Facebook.", "The fold-out note, penned by Lennon when he was 11 years old, thanks his Aunt Harriet for presents she gave him, including a book about ships.

She said: \"In the past few weeks, in my role as a teacher, I have been subjected to a campaign of sectarian intimidation. \"I have already expressed my warm thanks to all who have offered me support, including family, friends, colleagues, educationalists and politicians from various parties. \"I want to take this opportunity to publicly send a message of gratitude to those pupils of the Boys' Model School in north Belfast who have courageously offered me their full support. \"They are a testimony to the values that should permeate not just education but every aspect of society.  They inspire hope and confidence in me for the future.\" She added that her recent experience had shown \"that students can be much wiser, more mature, more responsible and more respectful than some who claim to speak on their behalf\". Ms Seeley's decision to leave her post was announced on Friday in a joint statement by the school's board of governors and the Belfast Education and Library Board. She is to move to another education board area. The Protestant Coalition group had objected to her employment at the school. It said her role at the school should be looked at because of her political views.

State prosecutors determined there was not enough evidence to convict him. Mr Lewandowski, supported by Mr Trump, accused Ms Fields of exaggerating the event and changing her story. \"Our perception is reality, her perception is that she was almost thrown to the ground,\" said Brad Cohen, Mr Lewandowski's lawyer. Police in Florida had charged Mr Lewandowski after Ms Fields filed a criminal complaint. \"Although there was probable cause to make an arrest, the evidence cannot prove all legally required elements of the crime alleged and is insufficient to support a criminal prosecution,\" prosecutor Dave Aronberg said. The announcement comes days before the New York state primary, which will be crucial to Mr Trump's campaign for the Republican presidential nomination. Mr Trump currently leads the race. Investigators did concede that Mr Lewandowski \"pulled Ms Fields back\" when she tried to interview Mr Trump, but said he could have thought she was \"making unwanted physical contact\" with him. \"While the facts support the allegation that Mr. Lewandowski did grab Ms Fields' arm against her will, Mr Lewandowski has a reasonable hypothesis of innocence,\" Mr Aronberg said The Trump campaign said in a statement that Mr Lewandowski is \"gratified\" by the prosecutor's decision. He \"appreciates the thoughtful consideration and professionalism by the Palm Beach State Attorney and his staff who carefully reviewed this matter, as well as Mr. Trump's loyalty and the support of his colleagues and family during this time, the statement reads. \"The matter is now concluded.\" Ms Fields tweeted that the office of the prosecutor asked her if she would accept an apology from Mr Lewandowski, to which she said yes, but that she has not heard back about it.

Mr Trump rejected calls to fire Mr Lewandowski and told him \"good job\" at a press conference shortly after the incident.", "After years of decline, the number of public authority homes sold in the year to March rose from 1,209 to 1,526. Ministers announced last year that right-to-buy, previously abolished for new tenants, was to end altogether. Statisticians concluded that the announcement was \"likely to be responsible\" for the upturn in sales. Over the same period, 1,140 new council homes were built in Scotland, the highest total in 25 years. The number of affordable homes also rose by 17%, with 7,012 completed. Housing minister Margaret Burgess said: \"Over 4,000 new council houses have been delivered through the Scottish government's council house building programme since 2009. \"The supply of affordable housing continues to be a high priority for us and we are working with the entire sector to increase the supply of affordable homes and deliver vital support for construction and housebuilding companies throughout Scotland. \"Since 2011 we have delivered more than 21,000 new affordable homes, bringing us over two-thirds of the way towards our five-year target of 30,000 new homes.\" Across Scotland the total number of new homes increased by 7% over the past year to 15,957 - with Aberdeenshire, Edinburgh and Glasgow accounting for more than a quarter. The increase is the first since 2007/08 but the supply of new homes still remains well below pre-recession levels. Ms Burgess said: \"This is the first annual increase since before the recession, reflecting the growing confidence within the housing market, which the Scottish government has helped to stimulate through investment in initiatives designed to support the sector and help people into home ownership. \"Nonetheless, new housing supply remains well below pre-recession levels and I recognise that the housebuilding industry continues to face a number of challenges.\" The Scottish Federation of Housing Associations (SFHA) broadly welcomed the new statistics. It said: \"The recognition, however, that we still have a very long way to go to recover from the 42% decrease in completions since then, is sobering and reflects the challenge to all providers of new housing. \"The drop in housing association completions represents the time lag between the introduction of the new subsidy levels in 2013 and the time taken to kick-start many projects previously unviable because of lower grant levels. \"However, the increase in approvals for housing association projects - up from 1,620 in 2012/13 to 2,875 in 2013/14 - gives some hope that we are beginning to recover from a devastating slowdown in the construction of social housing, at a time when almost one million Scots can't afford adequate housing conditions.\" Responding to the figures, trade body Homes for Scotland warned that sustained increases in production were now under threat after last month's announcement that the Scottish government's Help to Buy scheme had run out of money for this financial year. Chief executive Philip Hogg said: \"The figures show that the increase in supply was driven by the private sector and this clearly demonstrates the huge impact made by the very successful Help to Buy (Scotland) scheme, which has generated over 4,300 sales and reservations since launch less than a year ago. \"Whilst we applaud the Scottish government for introducing the scheme, funding for this year has already run out, leaving both buyers and builders very frustrated. \"The industry has effectively had the rug pulled from beneath it before any firm recovery has had the opportunity to take hold. \"And the impact is already apparent with significant drops in sales in the weeks since the budget expired in July.  We therefore fear a return to decline in the months ahead.", "Mr Duncan Smith has warned the government risks dividing society with politically-motivated spending cuts. Mr Cameron is to reject this - and No 10 has rubbished claims of a rift with George Osborne, saying the chancellor still has the PM's full confidence. The disability cuts Mr Duncan Smith quit over will be shelved. Downing Street said the changes to Personal Independence Payments (PIP) announced ahead of Mr Osborne's Budget last week would not go ahead \"in their current form\". But alternative proposals for saving the \u00c2\u00a34bn earmarked for the savings would not come until the Autumn Statement towards the end of the year. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has called for Mr Osborne's resignation and Conservative MPs have spoken out against the leadership with Mr Duncan Smith's former ministerial team divided in their responses to his resignation. Treasury minister David Gauke is answering an urgent Commons question from Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell on changes to the Budget - Mr McDonnell had called for the chancellor himself but this appears to have been ignored. This will be followed by a statement from Mr Cameron - ostensibly on last week's EU summit - at which he is expected to restate his commitment to \"compassionate Conservatism\" and reject Mr Duncan Smith's criticisms of his style of government. Former Tory leader Lord Howard urged MPs to \"listen to what the prime minister has to say\" and to \"calm down\". Mr Duncan Smith set out the reasons for his surprise resignation in an interview with the BBC's Andrew Marr, in which he said the way Mr Osborne had cut benefits in his Budget at the same time as cutting taxes for the better off was \"deeply unfair\" and that he had become \"semi detached\" from government. Ross Hawkins, BBC political correspondent George Osborne: chief tactician and patron, a man whose word makes or wrecks careers. That was the view of many Tory MPs for a very long time. Now, many doubt he will ever be their leader, or even the chancellor much longer. It's not that they think David Cameron is poised to sack him or that he's about to resign, as Labour demand. They simply believe a swift leadership election is highly likely whatever the result of 23 June's EU referendum. If it does come that soon, there will be - one predicts - a \"genocide of the Cameroons and Osbornites\". A stubbornly enduring deficit, a tax credit U-turn, and the sheer numbers of MPs who have chosen to back a leave vote at the referendum have seen Osborne's authority leak. A weekend of melodrama has - in one Tory MP's view - burst the dam. Read more from Ross Lord Howard played down Mr Duncan Smith's criticisms of government policy - but Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston said they were \"very serious\". \"Today, when David Cameron stands up, he has to reaffirm the message that led many people like myself to join the Conservative Party in the first place when he became leader,\" she said. \"Are we about social justice? Are we about spreading the burden fairly? We need to hear that very clear message today.\" She suggested pensioner benefits - which the Conservatives pledged to protect in their manifesto - should be cut to make up the shortfall. A number of senior Conservative figures have questioned Mr Osborne's credentials to replace David Cameron as prime minister when he steps down. Former chief whip Andrew Mitchell described Mr Osborne's abortive attempt to reform PIP as a \"cock-up\". He said Mr Osborne was \"not the only candidate\" for the party leadership and there were a \"large number\" of alternatives. Influential backbencher David Davis told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire the \u00c2\u00a34bn welfare savings should be cancelled and suggested Mr Osborne should be moved to another department if he wants to be a successful replacement for David Cameron as prime minister. London Mayor Boris Johnson, seen as Mr Osborne's main rival for the top job, is returning from a skiing holiday and has yet to comment. BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said it was understood Mr Cameron had urged Mr Osborne to avoid any major controversy in the Budget so as to avoid fuelling discontent among Tory MPs ahead of the EU referendum. Despite this, our correspondent said, Downing Street insists \"the two men remain as close as ever\", and have dismissed reports that the prime minister will seek to distance himself from Mr Osborne. Number 10 has stressed that PIP will still have to be reformed in the future as the cost is \"unsustainable.\" Mr Corbyn told the BBC Mr Osborne should be \"considering his position\". \"His Budget simply doesn't add up and it unravelled within hours of him presenting it. This isn't the first time a George Osborne Budget has unravelled,\" the Labour leader told BBC1's Breakfast programme. \"It seems to me we need to look at the very heart of this government, at its incompetence, at the way it puts forward proposals that simply don't add up and expects the most needy in our society to take the hit for them.\" Who would the disability changes impact?", "It comes after the UK's biggest inquiry into alleged neglect in six homes - Operation Jasmine - which cost \u00c2\u00a311.6m. Two were owned by Dr Prana Das, who once owned 25 homes in south Wales. But the case collapsed after he suffered a brain injury and could not stand trial. The families were left \"frustrated\" in their search for justice. Mr Jones, making his announcement, said he did not want the events of a decade ago to ever be repeated. \"I believe that we need a full and independent review of these events to understand whether there is anything else the social care sector and policy makers need to learn, anything else we need to put in place,\" he told assembly members. \"I expect the review to speak with the families of those involved as well as the local authorities involved, the police, the professionals and the regulators.\" Operation Jasmine  was a major Home Office funded inquiry set up in 2005 and spanned seven years, involved 75 police staff and 4,126 statements were taken. It identified 100 potential victims. It was established in October 2005 after Gladys Thomas, 84, a patient at Bryngwyn Mountleigh nursing home in Newbridge, was admitted to Newport's Royal Gwent Hospital after being given incorrect doses of medication. She later died. A nurse at the home admitted neglect on the basis of not administering the correct medication. Eight carers and nurses were charged with wilful neglect relating to injuries on her body but the prosecution dropped the case three weeks into the trial in 2008. Dr Das, 66, faced charges relating to neglect and fraud at two care homes - Brithdir Care Home in New Tredegar, near Bargoed, and The Beeches in Blaenavon. The review will be led by Dr Margaret Flynn, who has been involved in previous serious case reviews involving the elderly and is chair of Lancashire's Safeguarding Adults Board. The Older People's Commissioner for Wales Sarah Rochira said: \"The families of the victims of the alleged abuse and neglect investigated by Operation Jasmine, who I have met with many times, have told me that they want answers about what happened to their relatives and how abuse and neglect on the scale alleged could have taken place. \"But most of all, they have told me they want to make sure that it couldn't happen again to anyone else.\" Shadow social services minister William Graham said he welcomed the announcement \"wholeheartedly\". He said: \"The review must be comprehensive and wide-ranging and I am pleased to hear the first minister commit himself to this. \"Everything must be done to ensure events of this kind are never allowed to happen again Blaenau Gwent MP Nick Smith said families had wanted answers and justice. \"Without the bold decision by the first minister today, these families would have been let down by the system,\" he said. \"Their pain and guilt over what happened to their loved ones deserved a response, and I cannot welcome this response enough.\" Lib Dem spokesman for older people Aled Roberts AM added:  \"Just hoping that similar failings don't happen again is simply not enough. \"We need to be told how such a catalogue of failings were allowed to happen and learn from previous failings in the system, so that measures can be put in place to prevent these tragedies happening again.\"", "Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently (RBSS) said Ahmad Mohammed al-Mousa was killed by a group of masked men in the rebel-held city of Idlib on Wednesday.

The New York-based organisation condemned Mr Mousa's murder. \"Just a few weeks ago, nearly 900 journalists, press freedom advocates, and supporters attending CPJ's International Press Freedom Awards stood together in solidarity with Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently.

In October, RBSS member Ibrahim Abdul Qader was killed by IS militants, along with fellow journalist Fares Hamadi, in south-eastern Turkey.

Firms blamed soft domestic demand, a fall in new business from overseas and uncertainty ahead of the EU referendum. A slowdown in the oil and gas industry, a major customer for UK companies, is also hitting production. The index for new orders fell to 50.4 in April, from 51.9 the month before, matching February's three-year low. Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, said: \"On this evidence manufacturing production is now falling at a quarterly pace of around 1%, and will likely act as a drag on the economy again during the second quarter and putting greater pressure on the service sector to sustain GDP growth. \"The manufacturing labour market is also being impacted, with the data signalling close to 20,000 job losses over the past three months.\" Last week, official figures showed UK economic growth slowed to 0.4% in the first quarter of the year from 0.6% in late 2015, propped up by the services sector. David Noble, group chief executive at the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (CIPS), said: \"Recent fears over a stall in the UK's manufacturing sector have now become a reality. \"An atmosphere of deep unease is building throughout the manufacturing supply chain, eating away at new orders, reducing British exports and putting more jobs at risk. \"A sense of apprehension across the sector is being caused by enduring volatility in the oil and gas industry, falling retailer confidence and the uncertainty created by the EU referendum.\" The Markit/CIPS survey found new export orders contracted for the fourth straight month in April as the global economy continued to slow. A measure of employment in the manufacturing sector was also below the 50 mark for its fourth straight month. Lee Hopley, chief economist at the manufacturers' organisation, EEF, said: \"The sharp drop to a three-year low and another month of reported job cuts could be the clearest sign yet that referendum uncertainty is starting to weigh on the real economy. \"However, this is just another straw on the back of a sector already grappling with the struggling oil and gas sector, softening domestic demand and weak order outlook from other parts of the world, all of which are failing to provide any counterbalance to the political uncertainty at home.\"", "New research suggests the Cornish Black honey bee is better at dealing with varroa mites, which carry a strain of a disease called deformed wing virus. The virus has killed vast numbers of the world's bees. Scientists at Paignton Zoo are researching how the breed has survived the mite. The zoo hopes its findings will help protect colonies and encourage more bee keepers to take on the Cornish breed. Colonies of the bees have been moved to the zoo to monitor their health over the summer. The mites act as tiny incubators of one deadly form of the disease, and inject it directly into the bees' blood. Michael Bungard from the zoo said: \"It's important that zoos look in our own backyard. \"Our bee project is predominantly education, so we can get the message across about the Cornish black bees and the varroa mite.\"", "Media playback is not supported on this device A 2-1 defeat at Monaco sealed their exit from the competition as they paid the price for their woeful home form. Consecutive defeats at their temporary Wembley home had left Spurs with no margin for error and they duly came up short against a classy Monaco side. \"We need to improve our mentality and be ready every game,\" Pochettino said. \"From the beginning of the season, I said our challenge was not physical, it was tactical - to manage your mind and to play on Saturday and then Tuesday or Wednesday.\" Pochettino added he may need to add \"more quality\" to his squad. \"Our objective is to be competitive in the Premier League and Champions League but we need to show more,\" he said. \"Maybe after today, we see we struggle a bit.\" Tottenham were outclassed by Monaco at Stade Louis II, and only an inspired performance by goalkeeper Hugo Lloris prevented a bigger margin of defeat. Djibril Sidibe's header early in the second half sparked a stunning sequence of three goals in just five minutes, with Harry Kane levelling from the penalty spot only for Monaco to score the winner just 39 seconds later through Thomas Lemar. It was Spurs' third defeat in five Group E games, following reverses at Wembley against Monaco and Bayer Leverkusen, who have both now reached the last 16. By Phil McNulty, BBC Sport chief football writer All last season's hard work in the Premier League was carelessly tossed away in Tottenham's abysmal Champions League campaign, and the whole group phase has been a nightmare for manager Mauricio Pochettino. Spurs made Wembley their home as White Hart Lane's capacity is reduced by a rebuild, but the tenants have never settled. The curse of Wembley - the loss to Leverkusen was their sixth there in succession - was perhaps a convenient excuse, though, as the more uncomfortable truth was revealed in Monaco. Pochettino took a huge share of the blame from Spurs fans on Tuesday, and rightly so after a mystifying team selection. The Argentine knew Monaco were dangerous. He knew defeat would be fatal to their hopes. Yet still chose to gamble recklessly. Jan Vertonghen's presence was surely crucial, even more so with Toby Alderweireld injured, and yet he chose to leave the Belgian on the bench, pairing Kevin Wimmer with Eric Dier in central defence and picking Kieran Trippier ahead of Kyle Walker at right-back. Spurs were hopelessly exposed defensively. Any hope of setting up a final Wembley hurrah against CSKA Moscow by getting a good result in France went up in smoke as they produced a display lacking in intensity, quality and resilience. It summed up neatly their efforts in the Champions League. They have not been good enough and were not helped by a bad misjudgement from Pochettino. Former England international Phil Neville, part of the BBC Radio 5 live commentary team, described Spurs' display as \"the worst I've seen them play all season\". He added: \"They were wide open at the back, disorganised in midfield. The Champions League has been a real learning curve and they've been found out. \"They've made naive decisions in the Champions League and Tottenham are being punished. Positions you take in the Premier League don't get punished. Here they do.\"", "The rate hit 5.1% in the three months to November - its lowest rate since the three months to October 2005, according to the Office for National Statistics. The number of people out of work fell by 99,000 to 1.68 million in the three-month period. Average weekly earnings, including bonuses, were up 2%, the slowest increase since February. The 2% growth in wages was below the 2.1% growth forecast in a Reuters survey. Excluding bonuses, average weekly earnings growth slowed to 1.9% in the three months, the ONS said. The figures show that the employment rate hit 74% - the highest since comparable records began in 1971. The figures come a day after Bank of England governor Mark Carney ruled out an early rise in interest rates because of the turmoil in the global economy and weaker UK growth. A sustained improvement in wage growth was one of the factors he said would help the Bank to gauge when to raise rates. He has previously said he would like to see earnings growth at above 3% a year before rates are increased. Capital Economics economist Ruth Miller said the figures confirmed an interest rate hike \"is still some way off\". \"There still seems very little inflationary pressure coming from the labour market,\" she added. Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, the forecasting body of accountancy firm EY, said the jobless rate was now below the pre-crisis average of 5.2%, yet it had not triggered excessive pay growth: \"The latest pay numbers will exacerbate concerns raised in recent MPC meetings that very low inflation may be pushing down pay settlements, threatening a negative feedback between wages and prices. \"That the first post-crisis rate hike may be pushed back into 2017 is looking an ever-more realistic possibility.\" The latest ONS figures show that almost 23 million people are now in a full-time job, 436,000 more than a year earlier, while 8.4 million are working part-time, up by 152,000. The number of workers in part-time jobs wanting a full-time post is 1.2 million, down by 21,000 in the latest three months. Economic inactivity, counting people on long-term sick leave, looking after a relative or who have given up looking for work, fell by 93,000 to just under nine million, the lowest since the spring of 2014. The inactivity rate for women reached a record low of 27%. The figures for unemployment in the three months to the end of November are based on the Labour Force Survey, in which the ONS speaks to 40,000 households once a quarter, making it the country's biggest household survey. The ONS is 95% confident that the figure of a 5.1% rate of unemployment is correct to plus or minus 0.2 percentage points - in other words, it's between 4.9% and 5.3%.", "The verdict came from the Care Quality Commission's first inspection since the University Hospitals of North Midlands NHS Trust was created in November. The hospital was at the centre of a \u00c2\u00a36m public inquiry into care failings. But despite the CQC's overall finding being critical, the trust said it was \"highly complimentary\" about the standard of care in some areas. Inspectors visited County Hospital, formerly Stafford Hospital, and Royal Stoke University Hospital, also run by the trust, in April. They carried out unannounced inspections in May. Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust, which ran Stafford, was dissolved in November after a report concluded it was not \"clinically or financially sustainable\". 700,000 People served by the hospital trust 194,954 Combined A&E visits to the two hospitals (2013-14) 1,508 Beds provided across the two sites 8,848 Equivalent full-time staff employed by the trust The NHS in Staffordshire was given almost \u00c2\u00a3300m to create the new trust and relocate some services in the county. The CQC said it recognised \"that the leadership of the new trust has had the significant task of bringing together two organisations at a challenging time. We have seen that progress has been made but there is still more to be achieved\". The trust was rated as good overall for how caring its services were, but told it required improvement to ensure safe, effective and well-led services. It received an inadequate rating in relation to whether services were responsive. Several initiatives within children and young people's services at Stoke were rated as outstanding in relation to whether they were caring. Outstanding work was also seen in the specialised neurological unit at County Hospital, inspectors said. But the trust was told it must address high waiting times in its emergency department, and inspectors noted the Royal Stoke had \"consistently and frequently failed the four-hour waiting time target\". It also said the trust should review capacity and adequacy of critical care services, and communication between senior management and frontline staff. Mark Hackett, trust chief executive, said: \"Less than a year ago there were serious concerns about the sustainability, and therefore the safety, of services at County Hospital, but the CQC has now given the hospital 23 good ratings and just one inadequate rating.\" He said the trust was addressing the areas for improvement the CQC identified.", "The interior of the Saab 340 that flies to and from Orkney was stripped out and renewed and the exterior repainted at a cost of almost \u00a3270,000. Loganair, a franchise partner of Flybe, will spend \u00a33.5m having the same work done to the rest of its fleet. The first stage in the three-year project follows criticism about the reliability of Loganair services. The airline's business includes operating lifeline routes to and from the Scottish islands, including Lewis in the Western Isles, Orkney and Shetland. Last year, members of the public and MSPs raised concerns about the reliability of some of these services. In January this year, the company announced that it was investing \u00a315m in a programme of improvements and upgrades. As well as being given a revamp, each plane is to undergo a specialist check every 36 months. Loganair said this \"intensive process\" would involve stripping back the aircraft to the basic airframe structure for an examination using X-ray machines. Both engines and the flight control surfaces would also be removed to give access to the aircraft's structure and internal systems. Loganair chairman David Harrison said he was \"extremely pleased\" the first plane had been refurbished He said: \"Our engineers and support teams put an incredible amount of time and effort into the project, and I'm certain our customers will appreciate their endeavour and enjoy the comfort benefits the renewal project brings to the Saab 340 fleet. \"This Saab 340 renewal programme again underlines the commitment made by Loganair at the beginning of the year to embark on a significant investment programme to enhance the fleet and ultimately improve customer experience.\"", "A review of homes in Wales said they were seen as places of \"irreversible decline\" where residents were unable to do things that matter to them. The report was published by the Older People's Commissioner for Wales. The Welsh government said it was already taking action on issues raised in the report, A Place to Call Home? Care Forum Wales, which represents 500 care providers, said the findings support what it has long been saying. Experts in health and social care undertook unannounced visits to 100 care homes across Wales. And more than 2,000 questionnaires were completed by care home residents and their families. The report's key conclusion was: \"Too many older people living in care homes quickly become institutionalised. Their personal identity and individuality rapidly diminishes and they have a lack of choice and control over their lives.\" It looked at residents' social participation, their home environment, diet, staffing and training as well as commissioning, regulation and inspection of services. Commissioner Sarah Rochira called \"for action to deliver the change required within our care homes and ensure that quality of life sits at the heart of the delivery of residential and nursing care across Wales\". She said: \"While my review found excellent examples of truly person-centred care, enabling and empowering care that delivers the very best outcomes for older people, there are significant variations across Wales that result in too many older people living in care homes having an unacceptable quality of life.\" The review was undertaken using the commissioner's statutory powers which means care providers and public bodies have to act on the findings. Care and Social Services Inspectorate Wales (CSSIW) chief inspector Imelda Richardson said it had moved away from a tick box culture to focusing on quality of life of people during its inspections of older people's care homes in Wales. She said while the majority of care homes provide good or excellent care, there is \"still an unacceptable level of care in some homes\". Care Forum Wales chair Mario Kreft said the report did not \"fully recognise what is being achieved despite the system\". He supported a call for services being commissioned for quality rather than reinforcing a \"culture of compliance to the bare minimum\". He added: \"The commissioning process should be about quality and securing value for money and not about paying the lowest possible price.\" A Welsh government spokesperson said: \"The Welsh government, for its part, is already taking action on many of the areas highlighted in this report through a draft Bill to strengthen the regulation and inspection of social services. \"We expect the care sector to consider this report carefully - as the Welsh government will - and reply to the Older People's Commissioner's specific points.\"", "Jonathan Bell had been removed from office by the DUP as part of the rolling resignation scheme in response to a Stormont crisis. The crisis was sparked in September 2015. It centred around allegations that IRA members had murdered Kevin McGuigan. The DUP responded by saying it could not be business as usual at Stormont. Two days earlier a reduced tariff system for the Executive's RHI scheme was announced. But the ten week period before it could be introduced saw a now infamous spike in applications - when DUP ministers were away from their desks for all but a few hours a week. The rolling resignation plan designed by Peter Robinson ended on October 20. By which time applications for the scheme had rocketed. In September there were 99, in October 429 and in November 452. Almost as many applications were received as during the previous 34 months since the scheme began. The in/out ministers plan avoided an Assembly election having to be called.

As a result, shares in oil firms rose, with Exxon Mobil up 2% and Chevron 1.5% higher.", "The Labour leader has warned the terms of reference, which have yet to be published, could be too \"narrow\" and residents not properly consulted. He wants an interim report on the cause of the fire by September, followed by a wider probe into building regulations, council funding and other issues. The presumed death toll stands at 80. Police have warned the final figure will not be known until at least the end of the year. The leader of Kensington and Chelsea Council, Nick Paget-Brown, which was criticised for its response to the disaster on 14 June, quit on Friday. Retired former Court of Appeal judge Sir Martin Moore-Bick was appointed to head the inquiry on Wednesday. It will sit in public and have the powers to compel witnesses and obtain evidence. Visiting the scene of the blaze on Thursday, Sir Martin said he believed the probe and its recommendations would be \"pretty well limited\" to what had caused the fire and its rapid spread. Setting out his ambition to produce a report within a year, he said he was aware that people in the area want a broader investigation but he was not sure that his inquiry would be the right setting. The prime minister has said she expects an interim report to be made available as soon as possible and that survivors and residents should be consulted on the terms of reference. But Mr Corbyn said he wanted a guarantee the initial findings would be published by the end of the summer. In a letter to Mrs May, he said the inquiry would be best served by being split into two parts to ensure \"timeliness would not have to be sacrificed for rigour\". While understanding how the fire started was of the \"utmost importance\", he said survivors and other residents had a multitude of other questions about how their safety had come to be compromised and what could have been done to prevent the disaster. \"Whilst the detail of the specific failures at Grenfell needs to be uncovered, it is also clear that the Grenfell fire has much wider implications for national policy issues,\" he said. The issues that must be addressed, he said, included: \"An inquiry within narrow terms of reference risks failing to learn all the lessons of this tragedy.\" The PM has said the immediate priority is to establish the facts of what happened at Grenfell Tower and to take the necessary action to prevent a similar tragedy from happening again. But she has said the \"wider lessons\" must be learn from both this catastrophe, and the inspections of other buildings around the country that followed it.", "\"Dependency on giving that only appears to be charitable must end,\" he said in a tweet ahead of this weekend's African Union summit in South Africa.

A boy, 16, and a man, 20, suspected of involvement were also injured. Both were taken to different hospitals in the capital before they were arrested on suspicion of murder, police said. The teenager has since been discharged and released on bail while inquiries continue. The 20-year-old has also been discharged from hospital and is being held at a London police station. A post-mortem examination of Joshua's body found multiple stab wounds were the cause of death.

Prosecutors say Mr Hamayoon, Yousaf Syed, 20, and Nadir Syed, 22, plotted an attack using a Rambo-style knife. The cousins deny all charges. The image, allegedly taken on 19 September 2014, shows the back of the officer and was apparently taken by someone in a car. Mr Hamayoon wrote: \"Look at this kaffir. Hounslow parking lot.\" Nadir Syed wrote back: \"How can you pray in such a place?\" Mr Hamayoon replied: \"You're right I'm walking out. This kaffir cop yeh.  Looking inside every car who's in there. I gave him a dirty look.\" Mr Syed replied: \"He's looking for u mate.

Police in Italy have detained 10 suspected traffickers after 52 people were found dead in the hold of a ship off the coast of Libya on Wednesday. President Obama's spokesman said the migrant crisis showed that unrest in the Middle East had a worldwide impact. Josh Earnest said Europe should get tougher on traffickers who were exploiting migrants. On Friday workers from the Libyan Red Crescent were undertaking the grim task of recovering migrants' bodies which had washed up on the coast. \"We, the Red Crescent, work with nothing. Some fishermen help us with a boat,\" Ibrahim al-Attoushi from the Red Crescent in Zuwara told Reuters. \"We only have one ambulance car.\" Around 100 bodies have already been found, and the United Nations' refugee agency (UNHCR) said a further 100 people are unaccounted for. Some of those who died were trapped in the hull of one of the boats. The Libyan coast-guard had worked overnight on Thursday, searching for survivors from the two boats. At least 150 survivors of the sinkings have been taken to a refugee centre and a detention centre in Libya. Ayman Talaal, a Syrian survivor, said he and his family had been \"forced into this route\". \"It's called the route of death. It is now called the grave of the Mediterranean sea,\" he said. While most of the victims of Thursday's capsizes are thought to be from Syria and African countries, a Bangladeshi diplomat told the BBC that at least five Bangladeshi nationals, including a six-month-old baby, were among the dead. Some survivors were rescued having spent the night in the water, clinging to life jackets. Meanwhile officials in Palermo investigating the deaths of 52 migrants found dead in a boat's hold on Wednesday have detained 10 of the 571 survivors brought ashore, on suspicion of murder, Rai TV reports. Prosecutor Maurizio Scalia told AP that those detained included seven Moroccans, two Syrians and a Libyan. A Swedish coastguard ship, the Poseidon, working with the EU's Frontex border agency, brought the survivors and the bodies to the Sicilian port. Thousands of people set off from lawless Libya every night, packed into boats, trying to reach safety in Europe. Many of the vessels are not seaworthy and are overcrowded. Since the overthrow of Col Gaddafi in 2011, Libya has descended into chaos, with various militias fighting for power. The internationally-recognised government has been forced to leave Tripoli and does not control the country's western coast, from where most migrant boats depart, aiming for Italy. The UNHCR says more than 2,500 people have died trying to reach Europe so far in 2015, not including Thursday's deaths. Meanwhile Austrian police have confirmed that 71 people died inside a refrigerated lorry found abandoned on a motorway near the Hungarian border. They think that at least some of the dead were from Syria. \"If we had an orderly safe way for people to come to Europe then we would avoid these tragedies,\" the UNHCR's William Spindler told the BBC. \"We would also have less incentives for illegal immigration because we would have legal avenues to come, so people would not have to risk their lives in this way\".", "The draft Investigatory Powers Bill would place a legal duty on internet providers to assist in hacking devices. But it would not be restricted to phones and PCs, a tech industry chief told the Commons science and technology committee. Antony Walker, of techUK, said anything that connected to the internet could \"in theory\" be hacked into. In the future, this could include driverless cars or household appliances connected to the internet - the so-called Internet of Things - said Mr Walker. He said the Home Office needed to spell out more clearly where it draws the line over what it calls \"equipment interference\", highlighting recent concerns about \"smart toys\" that connect to the internet and have microphones and cameras built-in. \"A range of devices that have been in the news recently, in relation to a hack, are children's toys, that children can interact with,\" he told the committee. \"These are devices that may sit in a child's bedroom but are accessible. \"In theory, the manufacturer of those products could be the subject of a warrant to enable equipment interference with those devices. \"So the potential extent, I think, is something that needs to be carefully considered.\" In November, electronic toy company Vtech had its app store database hacked, allegedly resulting in the appearance online of personal data including children's names, dates of birth and gender. Talking dolls, such as Hello Barbie and My Friend Cayla, have also been put under scrutiny by security experts in recent months. Barbie manufacturer Mattel reportedly made modifications to Hello Barbie, which allows children to talk to the doll over a cloud server connection, after concerns were raised about cyber attackers potentially stealing data through it. The police, security services, HM Revenue and Customs and other law enforcement agencies can already hack into devices provided they get a warrant. This allows them to download the contents of computers or smartphones, track locations, listen to calls, or even switch on microphones and cameras, allowing officers to listen in to conversations or take pictures of those standing nearby. The Home Office says these powers, the existence of which were revealed earlier this year following a court case, have \"made a vital contribution to counter the increased threat to the UK from Islamist terrorism and have also enabled the disruption of paedophile-related crime\", according to a Home Office fact sheet. The draft Investigatory Powers Bill would put \"equipment interference\" warrants on a firmer legal footing and make sure they are \"only used when necessary and proportionate for a legitimate purpose\". A revised bill will be introduced to Parliament in the New Year, following consultation and scrutiny by the industry and other interested parties. Mr Walker, whose organisation represents 850 UK technology firms, told MPs it needed to be more forward-looking and less vague about the limits of surveillance. \"When we start to think, not just about the world today, but the world in five, 10 years' time as the Internet of Things becomes more real, and more pervasive. \"I think it requires careful thought in terms of where the limits should be.\"", "Councillors are to meet next week to consider bids to turn the hall into a food market or a hotel, with council officials backing the food hall plan. However a number of pre-conditions would need to be met before a draft lease could be agreed, at the authority's February meeting. The B-listed Edwardian building has sat empty since it closed 10 years ago. Councillors deferred a decision on which development bid to back, if any, in July, calling for further reports from Historic Scotland and other agencies and further information from the applicants. At that stage, council officials had backed the view of independent property specialists Jones Laing LaSalle that the Perth Market Place Ltd proposal should be preferred to the hotel bid from the Seventy Group. A report to councillors ahead of Wednesday's full council meeting noted that \"there has been a change in circumstances which significantly impacts upon the Seventy Group's bid\", meaning no further information could be provided. Planning and development head David Littlejohn has asked councillors to give the marketplace proposal \"preferred bidder status\" to allow detailed negotiations to take place. Should this happen, a draft lease could potentially be considered by the council in February 2016, although this would also have to be signed off by the Perth Common Good Fund Committee. The Edwardian building, which dates back to 1911, was closed 10 years ago after a modern new concert hall was opened in the city. Decisions over its future have been drawn out over a decade since then, with councillors at one point approving plans to have it demolished, which were subsequently blocked by Historic Scotland opposition. The development management committee then backed the Seventy Group plans to convert it into a luxury hotel, before councillors agreed to publicly market a 125-year lease on the building to find an alternative to demolition. Five bids were submitted in January, which where whittled down to two by July when councillors deferred the decision. Should neither bid ultimately win approval, demolition could still be an option, although Historic Scotland chief executive Ian Walford warned he would be minded to object to such a move. Mr Littlejohn also noted in his report that Historic Scotland had underlined that \"the process cannot be allowed to perpetuate\", and that a decision will have to be made.", "The annual Bank of Scotland Business Digital Index assessed small firms in five key skills needed to get the most out of being online. It found that fewer than a third of small businesses north of the border lacked these basic skills. This compares to a UK average of 38%. Only London rivals Scotland in terms of this measure. Experts said the lack of key digital skills was a primary barrier to doing more business online, with 15% of firms across the UK stating this was the main barrier, more than doubling since 2015. The skills assessed for the current report were managing information, communicating, transacting, creating and problem solving. The report also noted cyber security was rising in prominence as a reason for small businesses not doing more online. Almost 60% of Scottish firms said they still needed to invest in cyber security, lower than the UK average of 69%. Philip Grant, chair of the bank's Scottish executive committee, said: \"It's pleasing to see that the Business Digital Index shows digital maturity is increasing for small businesses in Scotland, however, there are still too many without basic digital skills. \"It's clear that being online can open the doors to opportunities, as well as cost and time saving benefits. \"We must do more to encourage small businesses based in Scotland to invest in digital skills, allowing them to make the most out of being online and to reap the benefits.\" Two thousand businesses and charities across the UK were surveyed, including 109 in Scotland.

Mounted and dog sections along with road policing units could be lost and community policing cut. Since 2010, the force has axed about 700 officers and 275 members of staff. Lancashire's Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) said \"savage\" budget cuts would have a \"devastating impact\" on policing. Clive Grunshaw said communities would be \"left at risk\" as the government continued to implement austerity cuts. Details of the force's cuts will be revealed after the government's Comprehensive Spending Review at the end of November.

The CIA said there was \"no indication\" that anything classified was released. But the documents do include a draft security clearance application containing personal information. They appear to all date to 2009, when Mr Brennan was seeking security clearance while applying for a job as a White House counterterrorism adviser. He was working in the private sector at the time, having already spent 25 years working for the CIA between 1980 and 2005. A high-school student claimed he was responsible for hacking the AOL account, telling Nthe New York Post he was protesting against US foreign policy. The boy's Twitter account, which says he is 13, has published redacted images of what appears to be government information. The documents published by Wikileaks include a draft on national security challenges said to have been created in 2007. The final, unfinished paragraph is headed \"Damaging Leaks of Classified Information\". A 2008 letter about interrogation methods is also included, appearing to be from the vice-chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence to his fellow board members. Wikileaks said it would release more documents \"over the coming days\". The FBI and the Secret Service are investigating the hacking. The CIA stressed that none of the documents released so far were classified. \"In fact, they appear to be documents that a private citizen with national security interests and expertise would be expected to possess,\" a statement said. High-profile leaks including a wealth of diplomatic cables from Wikileaks have dogged the US government in recent years. The use of private email has become a major issue in recent months for White House hopeful Hillary Clinton, since it emerged that she had operated a private account while secretary of state. Mr Brennan became director of the CIA in 2013, having spent four years as assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism.", "The charred pine twigs date back 140 million years to a time when fires raged across large tracts of land. Pine trees now dominate the forests of the Northern Hemisphere. The research suggests the tree's evolution was shaped in the fiery landscape of the Cretaceous, where oxygen levels were much higher than today, fuelling intense and frequent wildfires. \"Pines are well adapted to fire today,\" said Dr Howard Falcon-Lang of Royal Holloway, University of London, who discovered the fossils in Nova Scotia, Canada. \"The fossils show that wildfires raged through the earliest pine forests and probably shaped the evolution of this important tree.\" The specimens, which are described in Geology journal, were preserved as charcoal within rocks from a quarry. \"It was only when I digested [the samples] in acid that these beautiful fossils fell out,\" Dr Falcon-Lang told BBC News. \"They were sitting in my cupboard for five years before I actually worked out what was there.\" The fossils are just a few mm long but probably came from trees resembling the Scots Pine that now cover large areas of Scotland. Pines are well adapted to fire, containing inflammable deadwood that makes them burn easily. They also produce cones that will only germinate after being scorched, ensuring a new generation of trees is seeded after the fire has passed by and other vegetation has been destroyed. Scientists have debated for many years why some trees seem to thrive on wildfires. \"One of the oddities about pine trees today is that they are one of the most fire adapted species on our planet,\" explained Dr Falcon-Lang. \"These oldest pine fossils are preserved as charcoal, the product of fire, suggesting that the co-occurrence of fire and pines is something that's very ancient, that goes back to the very origin of these first pine trees.\" Dr Falcon-Lang plans to return to the quarry this summer to recover more specimens. He hopes to find fossils of flowering plants, which were evolving at the same time as the ancient pines.

The spectrum, formerly used by the Ministry of Defence, would provide 4G services for mobile companies. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has provisionally approved the proposed merger between BT and EE. But the European Commission has announced its decision to launch an in-depth investigation into the proposed merger between O2 and Three. And Ofcom has previously cast doubt on this merger winning regulatory approval. In a statement on Thursday, Ofcom said it had received letters from Telefonica and Hutchison stating their intention to bring legal action against the regulator over its decision to begin the auction before the outcome of the European Commission's findings. \"After careful consideration, given these specific circumstances, we have decided for reasons of good public administration to delay commencing the auction process,\" it said. Legal action also held up the previous 4G auction - as mobile companies disagreed about how spectrum should be distributed. Ofcom had been due to start accepting applications for the spectrum this month, with plans for the auction to take place in February or March. Now, it looks unlikely to begin before the summer - with the European Commission's judgement on the O2-Three merge expected in May. The spectrum on offer could add capacity to 4G networks, but it is considerably smaller than the previous chunk of 4G spectrum. It has a reserve price of \u00c2\u00a370m, compared with \u00c2\u00a31.3bn for the previous portion of the airwaves. Matthew Howett, an analyst with research company Ovum, said: While Ofcom doesn't have spectacular form when it comes to awarding spectrum on time, in this instance it probably makes sense to delay things. \"Should the merger between Three and O2 be approved, then remedies around spectrum holdings will almost certainly take time to work out and any future spectrum award would need to be reconsidered accordingly. \"However, if the... merger is blocked, then the spectrum award can go ahead fairly quickly without change.\" Mr Howett said the impact on consumers would be minimal. \"Despite demand for mobile data growing, all mobile operators are fairly well served by their current spectrum holdings and will be for the short to medium term, so while a delay is unfortunate, it shouldn't be too problematic,\" he said.", "Remains of a man aged between 30 and 49, were found close to the M54 motorway in Shropshire, in August.

Mr Percival, who died last month aged 99, never married or had children. The funeral home organising the service put an advert in a newspaper appealing for people to attend. The Reverend Alan Clark, who conducted the service, said: \"We marvel at the power of the printed word, whether on paper or screen.\" Mr Percival's nephew, Andrew Colyer-Worrsall, said the attendance was \"just remarkable\". \"He was a quiet man, he was an ordinary man who did his duty and served in the war and to see so many people turn up, it's just overwhelming,\" he said. \"I can only say thank you so much to everybody. \"We thought there would just be two or three of us, so to see this many hundreds of people turn up is stunning.\" Mr Percival, who lived in Penge, south London, before joining Bomber Command, died in Alistre Lodge Nursing Home in Lytham St Annes in Lancashire. Nursing home manager Lorraine Holt told BBC News she had been inundated with responses from people after the advert was reposted on social media sites. \"Late last night, we had a call from a soldier on leave from Afghanistan who said he wanted to attend. \"Then an 80-year-old lady from London who served in the RAF called us to say she was attending. \"The response has been absolutely incredible.\" The RAF Association Leyland branch, said they had also helped to ensure Mr Percival's funeral on Monday was well attended. By Steve BeckerBBC Radio Lancashire reporter Harold Percival was, by all accounts, something of a loner, with no close family or friends. Yet hundreds of people attended Lytham Crematorium to pay their respects, as a testimony to the power of remembrance and social networking. With the service taking place on Armistice Day, it became a particularly poignant event, drawing armed forces personnel,  charities and many members of the public. In fact, before the Last Post was played, a spontaneous round of applause broke out as his coffin was taken from the hearse. We'll never know the answer to the question posed by many people at the service: what would this quiet man have made of his send off? But most suspected he'd have been secretly pleased and proud. The association's standard bearer Stuart Dagger said: \"We are saying goodbye to a hero.\" The Dambusters March played as Mr Percival's coffin was carried into Lytham Park Crematorium at 11:00 GMT on Armistice Day. A two-minute silence was observed around the coffin to mark the anniversary of the World War One armistice before it was carried into the crematorium. About 100 people were inside with another 400 standing silently outside in the rain. Relatives of Mr Percival thanked those who attended and who spread the word saying \"We are overwhelmed. This shows how great the British public are.\" Mr Percival's nephew, David Worsell, who could not attend the funeral, said: \"He was a private man. \"He worked in Australia for a number of years as a decorator and would visit England for holidays. \"He travelled around England with only his backpack. \"He didn't have a postal address - he just used to get everything sent to my mother's address and would go through it when they met up.\" Frank Richard Carew-Percival, who contacted the BBC from Australia, said he was Mr Percival's nephew and was disappointed that he wouldn't be able to attend the service. \"He lived with us on and off in Australia and New Zealand. He loved cricket and taught my son how to spin bowl.\" He said his uncle was a shy man who led a \"nomadic type \" lifestyle. \"I managed to trace him six months ago and sent him photos of when he lived with us. \"We always had a Coe's room wherever we lived as he could turn up at any time.\" Mr Percival's family told the BBC a nephew, great-nephew and great-niece would be at his funeral.", "A BBC Freedom of Information request revealed 27 completed inquiries have resulted in potential disciplinary action against up to 15 officers. Eighteen forces are the subject of complaints about the handling of abuse. These include what the IPCC has called potential \"high-level corruption\". Of the investigations, 56 cases relate to alleged failures by South Yorkshire Police in responding to child sexual exploitation in Rotherham; 46 follow allegations against the Metropolitan Police, and 58 against Essex Police. Julian Blazeby, the IPCC's director of major investigations, said: \"We continue to receive referrals on police actions in child sexual abuse cases from forces across the country. \"The IPCC is committed to investigating the most sensitive and serious incidents of alleged police wrongdoing and many child sexual abuse cases fall within that remit.\" Some of the cases date back decades and include damaging claims that investigations were brought to a halt despite evidence of abuse being uncovered. In Rotherham, the 2014 report by Professor Alexis Jay revealed police suppressed evidence of the widespread sexual abuse of teenagers and failed to arrest the abusers. In London, allegations also centre on investigations being halted and evidence suppressed. They include claims that investigations were shut down prematurely or prosecutions not pursued because the suspects were politicians. However, in May 2016 one claim - that a prosecution was stopped when a defendant threatened to name the former prime minister, Sir Edward Heath, as an abuser - was dismissed by the IPCC. The suggestion that the powerful have been protected by the police is far from being proven. The current allegations span 17 English police forces and one in Wales. There are 84 independent IPCC inquiries - in which the commission directly investigates - under way, into: There are 102 managed inquiries, in which the IPCC oversees internal police investigations, in four forces: There is one supervised case, in which IPCC managers monitor the internal police investigation, taking place at Norfolk Police. The 27 completed cases have resulted in disciplinary action against two officers and disciplinary proceedings against 13 more. The IPCC says it is liaising closely with the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse and Operation Hydrant, the police team co-ordinating child abuse investigations. In an attempt to handle the increase in complex inquiries, the commission has created a new directorate of major investigations. The National Police Chiefs' Council lead for child protection, Chief Constable Simon Bailey, said the police service has \"risen to the challenge\" in changing the way it engages with victims and how it investigates abuse. But he added: \"Although we have improved our response, there is still more to do.  If there is concern that a victim hasn't received a full and impartial investigation into their allegations this should be referred to the force or IPCC to be scrutinised.\"", "Researchers from Trend Micro found blogs on the website had been modified to install malware known as Cryptesla on readers' devices. The malware holds files on the host machine to ransom and demands a payment to restore them. The Independent said it had removed all ads on the site while it investigated. \"It appears that an advert appearing on that blogsite may have included malware,\" said a spokesman for the newspaper. \"There is no suggestion or evidence that any of our users have been affected by this.\" The spokesman said the site affected was an old or \"legacy\" system that was now rarely visited. According to Trend Micro, the ransomware has been present on the Independent blogs website since at least 21 November. \"We reported it to them on Tuesday - but, as of today, it is still happening,\" said Raimund Genes, chief technical officer at Trend Micro. \"Now we need to go public to warn people who are not using security software like ours.\" The malware exploits a security hole in Adobe Flash Player to install itself on a victim's computer. Once downloaded, it sets about encrypting documents, rendering them useless without the key to decrypt them, for which it demands a ransom. The vulnerability in Flash has since been patched, but anybody using an old version of the web browser plug-in could still be at risk. \"For a while on Tuesday, the malware didn't trigger. But that was not the Independent solving it, it was the attackers updating the malware with a new version,\" said Mr Genes. \"My advice is to update your Flash Player. Always do it immediately when it says an update is available, because Flash remains one of the main ways attackers can compromise a system.\" The spokesperson added that the media group was now looking into the incident. \"We are currently investigating third-party advertising suppliers that are used by our externally hosted blog platform Independent blogs, which is a separate entity to independent.co.uk,\" they said. \"Less than 0.2% of the Independent digital audience visited this separate, legacy blogsite in the entire month of November,\" the spokesman added.

Eric Hill quickly photographed the sign, which should have read \"right\", prior to the error being painted over. A spokesman for the Co-op said the contractors were made aware of their mistake and would amend the spelling \"as quickly as possible\".", "Inflation is among the highest in the world, there are long queues for basic goods and the atmosphere on the streets is becoming increasingly agitated. Meanwhile politicians on both sides are so hostile to each other, a political solution remains remote. For years, the opposition in Venezuela has claimed the country was \"becoming another Cuba\" but such claims were rarely given much credence, or dismissed as hyperbole. But the BBC's Will Grant, who has lived in both countries, says there are growing parallels to a specific point in Cuba's past. Etched into Cuba's collective memory is its infamous Special Period. A reference to the years just after the collapse of the Soviet Union, it is a time forever synonymous with suffering, austerity and hunger on the communist island. Without its wealthier benefactors in Eastern Europe, Cuba struggled to provide enough food for its people. The stories from those days are legion. People remember selling family heirlooms to buy food and even stray cats ending up in the cooking pot. Whether the tales are apocryphal or not, Cuba was certainly on its knees economically, and largely remained that way until a leftist former soldier took power in Venezuela. Once Hugo Chavez became the president of Venezuela, which has the largest proven oil reserves in the world, things quickly started to look up for Cuba. Mr Chavez aligned closely with Cuban leader Fidel Castro, and began to fill the gap that the Soviets had left behind. These days, though, Venezuela is the more troubled of the two socialist allies. What's gone wrong in Venezuela? Having lived in Venezuela at the height of Mr Chavez's power, when oil was worth more than $130 a barrel, and having last visited Caracas in April 2013 when Nicolas Maduro was elected president, it was quite a shock to see for myself how quickly things have deteriorated. While the place was always chaotic, run by a sort of live-television ad-hoc form of policy making, I have never seen it quite like this. We encountered the first queue, snaking back for over a block, almost as soon as we emerged into the west of the capital from the airport. It did not take long to see lots more. As in Cuba, the government subsidises and controls the prices of certain basic goods. Now, with inflation spiralling, hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans spend their days waiting outside stores for bread, flour, baby milk, cooking oil, nappies and toilet paper. Worse still, many join those queues based on rumour alone, in the forlorn hope of finding those products on the shelves only to be turned away empty handed after hours in the blistering sun. Needless to say, in such circumstances, tempers can easily fray. \"We don't sell the subsidised goods,\" explains Sonia, a 40-year-old storeowner who provided us a little refuge from the pushing and shoving unfolding in the street outside her shop. As we stand on her roof terrace, a healthy distance away from the soldiers who had tried to stop us from recording and to confiscate our equipment, Sonia explains how she and her husband were initially disappointed that they had not been granted the concession to sell government-regulated products a few years ago. But now, she says, it has saved them from the madness that their competitors on the other side of the road are dealing with on a daily basis - desperate crowds and armed troops at the door, the spectre of looting constantly hanging over them. \"People can end up killing each other in these situations,\" she comments, tears forming in her eyes. \"It's sad, so sad to live like this. We have young daughters and at times, even we have to resort to buying from the black market.\" As we watch the troops corralling the queue into order, Sonia points out people she says are \"bachaqueros\", price speculators and black marketeers who wait in line to purchase food not for their families but to sell on at a huge profit. The black market for basic goods has been thriving in Cuba for decades. It now looks set to become a common feature in Venezuela too. \"Venezuelans are good people\", she says. \"We really don't deserve any of this.\" Meanwhile, President Maduro came to a regional summit in Cuba to drum up support in his war of words with Luis Almagro, the head of regional body the Organization of American States. The latter recently said the Venezuelan president was in danger of becoming just another \"petty dictator in Latin America\" and proposed invoking the organisation's democratic charter against him. Cue some pretty earthy language from President Maduro:  \"I suggest you put this democratic charter in a very thin tube and find a better use for it, Mr Almagro. You can shove that democratic charter wherever it fits.\" Of course, back when Cuba was battling through its darkest economic days, Venezuela was very cosy with Washington. President George Bush Snr visited Caracas in 1990, Bill Clinton seven years later. As Nicolas Maduro left Cuba, an island which first formed his socialist ideals, the irony cannot have escaped him - one country recently entertaining the US president as a friend, the other on the brink of economic collapse.

Bedfordshire Police asked anyone who recognised the man's voice to contact them. A flat-screen television and other electrical items were stolen from the house. The calls were made in the early hours of Saturday 25 October using a cordless telephone, which was then left on a table in the garden, police said. The man called two Luton taxi firms which were both dealt with by the same control office. In the first call, the suspect was asked to leave his landline number, but said he did not know it. He was then asked to leave his mobile number and he started to, but then stopped, claiming he did not know it. Police said he then made a second call and got through to the same controller, who explained the office handled calls for more than one taxi firm.

The take-up is 77% - 6% higher than in Scotland and 8% above Northern Ireland. Rhodri Williams, Ofcom director for Wales, said public funding to roll out the Superfast Cymru programme across Wales had \"transformed\" the picture. \"Things have improved due to the substantial amount of public investment that has taken place,\" he said, with financial backing coming from the EU, the UK and Welsh governments. But other findings in the report showed that Wales had the lowest availability of 4G services across the UK, with just under a quarter (23%) of adults having a 4G service in May 2015. Deputy minister for skills and technology Julie James welcomed the report and added: \"Fast and reliable internet connections are vital.\" The findings are part of Ofcom's 10th annual review of the communications market in Wales. The report showed people in Wales are the television addicts of the UK. On average they spend four hours 11 minutes watching TV a day - more than anywhere else in the UK. Despite people in Wales continuing to watch significantly more television than those in the UK as a whole, the average time they spent watching broadcast television declined by 12 minutes in 2014. And the report found the Welsh had more pay TV than anywhere else in the UK with seven in 10 households buying extra channels. The BBC's television services continue to perform better in Wales than in any other nation for reach, share, viewing hours and viewer appreciation scores. More than one in five Welsh adults said they were \"hooked\" on social media. Six in 10 adults in Wales have a tablet computer in the household compared to less than half (45%) last year. But internet users in Wales cited the laptop as their most important device for going online. Most internet users in Wales said they spend around 21.2 hours online per week with more than half of all Welsh internet users spending time on social networking sites on a weekly basis.

A passage from the Koran was read during an Epiphany service at St Mary's Cathedral in Glasgow earlier this month. Mr Ashenden said the reading had caused \"serious offence\". The cathedral has said it is standing by its decision. St Mary's invited local Muslims, who also revere Jesus as a prophet, to join the service. A student, Madinah Javed, read from the lectern in Arabic from the chapter of Maryam, or Mary. The chapter tells the story of the birth of Christ to the virgin Mary, and includes the Islamic teaching that Jesus is not the son of God and should not be worshipped. Mr Ashenden told BBC Radio 4's Sunday programme: \"The problem with what happened in Glasgow was that, although it was presented as a way of building bridges and a way of educating people, it was done badly, in the wrong way, in the wrong place, in the wrong context. \"There are a number of members of the congregation who have written open letters complaining of the profound upset they experienced as people who are part of the Eucharistic community who had come to worship Christ.\" The cathedral's provost, the Very Rev Kelvin Holdsworth, has said readings of the Koran in the cathedral were part of efforts to build relationships between Christians and Muslims in Glasgow. He said: \"Such readings have happened a number of times in the past in this and in other churches and have led to deepening friendships locally, to greater awareness of the things we hold in common and to dialogue about the ways in which we differ.\" Asked if he had known what the Koran verse specifically said about Jesus, Mr Holdsworth declined to comment further.", "The 34-year-old rejoined the New Lawn side in July 2016 and was ever-present as they won promotion to League Two last season.

But you have to start somewhere, and this is where we're starting.\" Mr Carter was at pains to point out that the role of the force would be to take on the Islamic State and not the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. However, he did not say what would happen if the rebels engaged the Syrian army. \"We have not determined yet all of the rules of engagement... but we have acknowledged that we have some responsibility to support them,\" the defence secretary said. The fighters will be paid by the United States, and, when deployed, will continue to receive back up and support from coalition forces. There are about 450 coalition forces involved in the training at the four sites, including about 350 Americans. The Pentagon intends to train and arm more than 15,000 rebels over the next three years. Mr Carter made it clear that the support did come with strict conditions. \"An explicit part of their training is how to conduct themselves in a way that is consistent with international law,\" adding: \"Any continued support for them would be strongly conditioned upon their continued good conduct.\" The Pentagon would not disclose when the troops would be ready to enter the battlefield. Since last year, the US has been part of an international coalition conducting an air strike campaign against Islamic State, which took over large swathes of Syria and Iraq in a lightning offensive.", "The newly minted millionaire was reported to have just returned from a holiday with his family when they were told the news. \"My husband was literally pumping the air when he was on the phone,\" said the unnamed child's mother, according to local media.

Texas passed the legislation last year and it goes into effect in August. Many higher education officials and students have objected to the law, with concerns it may discourage students from attending universities in Texas. Supporters of the law argue it is \"critical\" to self-defence and upholding constitutional rights. But for Frederick Steiner, dean of the Texas School of Architecture, guns should not be allowed on university grounds. \"I grew up believing there was an appropriate place for guns and it was not in a place of higher education and higher learning,\" he told Fox News. \"I thought I would be responsible for enforcing a law I don't believe in,\" said Mr Steiner, who has been at the school since 2001. He says he plans to return to the University of Pennsylvania, but not until the law is passed in August. Greg Fenves, president of the University of Texas, has said he does not support guns on campus but he must enforce the law. Mr Fenves said that the law would make it more difficult to keep faculty and students at the university. Long-time dean Frederick Steiner agreed, saying it was \"already part of the conversation when I was trying to recruit and retain graduate students.\" Meanwhile, staff at the University of Houston have warned professors there to be careful discussing sensitive topics and drop them from the curriculum if they \"sense anger\" from students who may be armed. According to the Houston Chronicle, they have been instructed to \"not 'go there' if you sense anger; limit student access off hours; go to appointment-only office hours; only meet 'that student' in controlled circumstances\". According to the law, private universities are allowed to ban guns on campus.", "Rockstar have announced the game's release has been delayed until 24 March.

The number of employees at the time had fallen to just 14 but the new owners said that now stood at 67. Director Chris Williams said that if new work they hoped to secure did come in then numbers would rise further. He said that would also leave them with the potential of a full order book for the next two years. The site on the outskirts of Dumfries employed about 140 staff before it went into administration. Mr Williams said they had completed their first stage of restructuring the company while managing to increase staffing levels. He said they had concentrated on re-employing as many people as possible while building up orders. \"We have had massive support from Scottish Enterprise who have helped us from the day we took over and hold regular meetings with us to offer their support in a lot of different ways,\" he said. \"There are numerous different projects we are tendering for currently internationally and SE have also offered us support with this as well which is invaluable to us.\" He said they had faced a number of challenges with suppliers who had lost money when the old company entered administration \"understandably wary\" of doing business with them. \"However, those who support the company will be rewarded in the future as bigger projects come off,\" he said. \"We will aim to put as much money back into the local economy and previous suppliers as possible to enable us to trade freely and have a good reputation in the future, the same as our existing company.\" He said that overall he was positive about the direction the business was heading in. \"All in all things are looking good for the future,\" he said. \"It is still a tough climate and with Brexit you just don't know what's around the corner. \"But we are carrying on with what we know best which is to give the customer the best possible service and turnaround time that is also competitively priced.\"", "John and Elizabeth Knott from Bosbury, in Herefordshire, were found dead at their home in August. Each had died from a single shotgun wound. A shotgun registered to Mr Knott, 71, was recovered by police at the scene. Assistant Coroner Roland Wooderson recorded a verdict of unlawful killing for Mrs Knott, while finding Mr Knott intentionally took his own life. The couple's daughter Elizabeth Conway said she was shocked, but not surprised. \"Mum didn't want to continue to live like that and Dad couldn't see a life without Mum,\" she said in a statement. The inquest, sitting at Hereford Town Hall, heard Mrs Knott, 70, had been suffering from Alzheimer's disease and anxiety. Friends described how Mr Knott had been devoted to his wife, known as Anne, and had been upset when she attended a nearby respite care home. A couple of days after arriving at the care home, the inquest was told Mr Knott arranged for his wife to return home and two days later the couple were found dead. Relatives alerted police after becoming concerned about them. They were found in a workshop at the back of their garage. The door had been locked from the inside and the handle removed. Giving evidence, Det Sgt Tim Powell said there was no sign of any third-party involvement. The inquest also heard Mr Knott had been concerned by plans by travellers to move on to land next to their home.", "Last week's news that Nigeria's Inspector General of Police, Ibrahim Idris, wants all new recruits to the country's police force to undergo a lie detector test cannot have been an April fool's joke as it's now the end of August. A police statement stated clearly that the \"polygraph test is aimed at ensuring that candidates are not of questionable character\", and that new police officers should \"conform to acceptable standards necessary for an ideal police officer the Nigerian people deserve\". Tendai Biti, Zimbabwe's former finance minister: \"Whenever I see a policeman, I run away because he sees me as an ATM\" Just what sort of questions would be set for the future cops is not clear, but the move is innovative and opens up all manner of possibilities on the African political landscape in our search for the kind of public officials the continent deserves. And why stop at just police recruits? Journalists could be asked: \"Have you ever taken money to write or ignore a story?\" Football players in the Under-17 World Cup could break out in a sweat at the simple inquiry: \"How old are you?\" Politicians and presidents, meanwhile, may find the truth-telling exercise a challenge too far. The search for honest police officers who fulfil the \"acceptable standards\" sought by Nigeria's police chief could be extended to most African states. Back in July, citizens in the Zimbabwean capital, Harare, vented their anger over phony police roadblocks, which crop up every few miles \"to check the roadworthiness\" of vehicles, but more importantly provide a pretext to spot-fine drivers and extract money from impoverished commuters. And since the state is struggling to pay public workers, it is entirely credible that such fines exist to supplement the officers' meagre and late salaries. \"Whenever I see a policeman, I run away because he sees me as an ATM,\" declared Tendai Biti, former finance minister. Encounters with African police forces can also be deadly. Ethiopian police clashed with demonstrators demanding answers to human rights abuses in the north-west of the country, and several people lost their lives in the city of Bahir Dar in the Amhara region. Farai Sevenzo: \"Following orders, history has sometimes instructed us, is not a credible excuse\" Force is the default setting for African police, with officers deployed on the streets willing to unleash tear gas in Nairobi, Harare, Lusaka, Addis Ababa or any other African capital. Anti-government demonstrations in Harare last week saw water-cannon and yet more tear gas as the government blamed unknown \"foreign elements\" for trying to incite rebellion. In the age of instant news and social media sharing, the evidence of African police brutality is a click away and all over the web. So, would a polygraph test for new recruits lessen such incidents? What kind of questions would the recruits have to answer? Would there be questions about their sympathy for the beaten citizens? Or would they be about their loyalty to entrenched police chiefs who have had jobs for life, much like the men who appointed them? As governments face dissent, citizens are promoting the idea that those police officers firing live bullets into groups of demonstrators, or starring in their own brutality videos as they rain down truncheon blows on fleeing citizens, should be recorded, identified and have their details stored for future prosecutions. Following orders, history has sometimes instructed us, is not a credible excuse. Whatever becomes of the Nigerian inspector general's intriguing idea to introduce lie-detector tests, he should remember the double-edged nature of such an exercise. The polygraph reveals the truth-tellers and may show him honest cops who pass the test, but it will also give him the best liars who will bluff their way through anything.

Doncaster believes the exciting drama of last season augurs well for the new campaign. \"After such an exciting end to last season: we had Aberdeen pushing Celtic close at the top and we had an incredible battle at the bottom of the Premiership with the top of the Championship in the play-offs; absolutely endorsing the decision the clubs made a couple of years ago to create them,\" he said. \"With Hearts returning to the top tier, you've still got Rangers and Hibernian in the Championship and I'm sure there'll be as much tension in the Championship this year as there was last. \"Who knows where Hearts will be this year? \"The league never gets to choose the clubs that appear at any level of the game. Last year was incredible to have Hearts, Hibernian and Rangers - three huge clubs - in the second tier. \"We welcome Hearts back this year and a lot of people will be looking to see how Robbie Neilson gets on.\" Doncaster also responded to reports that the SPFL has been inundated by complaints that all 10 in League Two clubs will be worse off as a result of corporate hospitality and advertising requirements in the ruling body's new \u00a32m sponsorship agreement with Ladbrokes. \"I read that I was inundated with complaints which seemed a bit hyperbolic,\" he said. \"I had two clubs who emailed me with some queries on the deal. There is a concern about the distribution model and the way in which the sponsorship revenue is divvied up. \"But the reality is that if you look at broadcasting revenue, that gets divvied up amongst all 42 clubs and League Two clubs don't put anything into that deal. \"So, I think it's a fair distribution model and has delivered more money for clubs than under the old split league system - with the SFL operating independently of the SPL - I think the vast majority of clubs are delighted with the way the merger has panned out and the way the SPFL is operating. \"The overall response I've had from the majority of clubs has been overwhelmingly positive.\"", "Just over 1,000 soldiers from two signals regiments and their families will be moving to Beacon Barracks.

It comes after months of warnings that services provided by councils for the elderly are under threat because of a lack of funding. The numbers getting help in care homes and in their own homes for daily tasks such as washing and dressing have been falling in recent years. This trend has been blamed for contributing to the growing pressures being seen in the NHS, particularly the rise in visits to A&E. Social care chiefs have said they will need to spend nearly \u00a320bn on services this year. But even when you take into account the extra money being raised from council tax increases and NHS money that is being transferred across, (both previous policy announcements to help out the sector) councils are still nearly \u00a31bn short of what they need. By 2020 that funding gap is predicted to grow to \u00a32.6bn. The money announced in the Budget will go some way to plugging that gap, but clearly not all the way. It is expected to be phased in - with \u00a31bn coming next year and the remaining \u00a31bn spread out over the subsequent two. This will go into a pot shared across both services for the elderly, and those provided to younger adults with disabilities. Charities have called it a \"sticking plaster\" to the wider problems facing the sector. Although, to be fair to the chancellor, he said the extra money would be followed by a green paper later in the year to overhaul the entire system, which has remained largely unchanged since it was created along with the NHS, after the Second World War. About 500,000 people in England pay the full cost of their care in England. This can prove very expensive. One in 10 people face costs of over \u00a3100,000 once they pass the age of 65. And there is growing evidence these self-funders are helping to prop up the council-funded side of the market. Analysts LaingBuisson have calculated that the fees councils pay care home firms are \u00a3100 a week below the actual cost of providing the care. Its researchers say this shortfall has effectively created a \"hidden care tax\" with self-funders now paying more than 25% extra for the same care. To limit these costs the coalition government announced in 2013 it would be introducing a cap on the cost of care so no-one paid more than \u00a372,000 over their lifetime. This was meant to be introduced in 2016, but that was delayed until 2020. The green paper that was announced in the Budget will set out how - indeed if - that policy will be incorporated into any future changes. But the extra money will do nothing to help these people. More than 4m people over the age of 65 have care needs, but only about 1.35m of them get formal care - either by paying for it themselves or relying on council help. What happens to the rest? There are 1.5m people who are cared for by family and friends and another 1.2m who struggle by with little or no help. In theory councils could use the extra money to increase the number of people they help. But given there's already a shortfall in funding to maintain the status quo, it seems doubtful this will happen. Again, the promise of longer-term reform remains their best hope. They may also benefit from extra support announced in the Budget for the NHS. There is \u00a3100m extra to help A&Es ahead of next winter and \u00a3325m over the next three years to help with NHS reform by getting local plans off the ground to shift care out of hospitals and into community services. Eventually this should help boost services such as GPs and district nursing, which the frail elderly are heavy users of. However, given the health budget is currently nearly \u00a3120bn a year, the impact of this extra money will be limited.

Contributions made by black people to history and culture will be celebrated throughout October. The event's first youth awards, Young Gifted and Black, for people aged between 13 and 30, took place in Cardiff on Thursday. Ms Mpukusa, from Swansea, started playing tennis aged nine on a school trip, and her dad picked up the sport and read books in order to help her. She struggled to compete in tournaments due to her financial situation. She stopped playing at age 13 because of her asylum case, but returned to the sport two years ago when her family was granted an indefinite stay. She started that year as the 123rd best player and has now returned to the number-one spot. Ms Mpukusa : \"It really means a lot to me, words can't explain how much my parents have struggled and how much that I've struggled. \"This award, I can show people that if you work hard, if you're determined, if you sacrifice, you can become big and people can recognise how hard you work.\" Ify Iwobi from Swansea battled obsessive compulsive disorder, (OCD) to win the music award. She said: \"When I was young, especially when I was a baby, I used to tinker up to the toy pianos that we had in the house and I used to just experiment with the keys and just tap along and make different sounds with my baby hands. \"My friends were like 'she's drawn to the piano, there's something that she's drawn to with the piano so we need to get this talent honed'. So when I was a bit older, from six, I started classical piano lessons. \"It hasn't been easy expressing my music especially, with the OCD... that includes disturbing thoughts, memories from the past which weren't that pleasant, basically they would disrupt what goes on from day-to-day living. \"That would get in the way of me and my personal practice on the piano, waste a lot of time and energy. \"I had to have lots of therapy, I had to go to lots of counselling and they gave me ways to think positively.\" Roselynn Mbwembwe, 15, a dancer from Swansea, won the award for the performing arts. She has been dancing since she was eight-years-old and had won over 25 awards in dance, including Welsh dancer of the year. She said the award is not just for her \"but for other children like me too\". Christopher Nation, 19, from Fairwater in Cardiff, picked up the young carer award. His family is originally from Jamaica and he has been looking after his mother since he was six. \"It's important for us to know our history. It's easy for us to get caught up in the way that the west is and forget about our own culture and things like that,\" he said. More than 100 people attended the event in the Senedd. The origins of Black History Month go back to 1926 in America, and there are now more than 6,000 events across the UK. Ray Singh, chairman of Race Council Cymru who judged the awards, said: \"These young people have so much to offer our society and many have already made some rich contributions as carers, community leaders, musicians and volunteers. \"Their impact is already visible in the fields of science and innovation, citizenship and performing arts. \"Now, post-Brexit, it is about looking forward and ensuring that Wales is a nation where black history, arts and cultural differences can be the subject of celebration and not division.\"", "Habtom Zerhom was first shot by a security guard at a bus station in Beersheba and then kicked and beaten by a crowd as he lay in a pool of blood. A post-mortem examination found he died of bullet wounds - not the beating. Officials said a prison officer, a soldier and two civilians were charged with aggravated battery. Mobile footage on 18 October showed an angry crowd surrounding Mr Zerhom as he was lying injured on the floor, under a stool held over him by a member of security. A set of chairs was then dumped on his head before he was kicked by the mob. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu later urged Israelis not to take justice into their own hands. The beating happened at the time of a deadly attack by an Israeli Arab at the same place in Beersheba. That attacker killed an Israeli soldier and wounded 10 other people. The gunman was later shot dead. Initial reports said two people had attacked the bus station in the southern Israeli city. Twenty-two Israelis Israel have been killed in a wave of stabbings, shootings and car rammings by Palestinians since October, officials say. The Palestinian health ministry says 149 Palestinians have been killed in that time. More than half were said by Israel to be attackers. Others have been killed in clashes with Israeli forces.", "The Seagulls remain one point ahead of second-placed Newcastle. Tommy Smith's angled shot put the hosts in front before Tomer Hemed rounded the goalkeeper to equalise. Nahki Wells fired into the top corner and Elias Kachunga nodded in to make it 3-1 before half-time, and Lewis Dunk's red card added to Brighton's misery. Centre-back Dunk was sent off for a second yellow card midway through the second half for a lunging challenge on Izzy Brown, having been booked in the first period for a foul on the same player. The Terriers' seventh win in nine league matches keeps them fifth, but they are now just two points behind fourth-placed Leeds, who they play at home on Sunday. Brighton, knocked out of the FA Cup by non-league Lincoln five days earlier, were uncharacteristically poor in defence and conceded three goals in a league match for the first time in almost 12 months. The outstanding Rajiv van La Parra had already hit the post before full-back Smith's attempted cross landed back at his feet, and his subsequent shot flew in at the near post. Hemed pounced on a poor back header from Huddersfield's Aaron Mooy to level, but that proved to be the only clear chance they created in the entire 90 minutes. Wells' excellent finish from just inside the box was his 100th goal in English football, and it was the former Bradford forward's shot which goalkeeper David Stockdale palmed into the air for Kachunga to head in Huddersfield's third from close range. After Dunk's dismissal, the fifth of his career, there was still time for Australian midfielder Mooy to strike the upright from long range and Stockdale to tip over a powerful attempt from substitute Kasey Palmer. Huddersfield head coach David Wagner told BBC Radio Leeds: \"It was a good one, maybe one of the best this season. We scored three goals and had chances for more, and conceded a sloppy goal which was easy to avoid, but it was very good. \"We are fresh and still very hungry and greedy, even when we are humble and we know we're playing against the best team in the division. \"We gave ourselves no limits, we try our best and today our best was very good.\" Brighton manager Chris Hughton told BBC Sussex: \"Every now and again you get a real bad one, and that was a real bad one. \"We were nowhere near the levels you need to play any game in this division, never mind one as good as Huddersfield, and on their own ground too. \"If we put in another performance like this at Brentford on Sunday, we will lose again. We need to be far better. \"Lewis Dunk has played the ball but he was already on a yellow and he's given the referee a decision to make. It's another one for him and something he has to learn from.

It would provide information on predicted and ongoing natural disasters and guide people from affected areas. The couple will present their idea at a space conference in Manchester which begins on Tuesday. They will also have the chance to pitch it to a Dragons Den-style panel of space experts in June, who could commission the idea to be developed into a fully-working app that is hoped could save lives. It would guide people to safety using advanced maps services and once activated, would emit a signal using GPS to indicate a person's location for search and rescue services. Mr Vale is nearing the end of a semester at University Centre in Svalbard, which lies inside the Arctic Circle. A recent avalanche which destroyed a house on the Norwegian archipelago heightened his awareness of the risks posed by natural disasters, and the potential uses for an app like GeoRescue. \"Thankfully no-one was injured by the avalanche, but it made me acutely aware of the risks of living in a dangerous environment,\" Mr Vale said. Mr Vale said Ms Mountain initially came up with the premise. \"I agreed that that was an important thing to address, especially given that living where I am currently constantly has the threat of avalanches,\" he said. \"I brought together the satellite data, demonstrating how current instruments exist to help with flooding, forest fires, earthquakes, avalanches, tornadoes and even volcanoes, as well as the capabilities for providing emergency service routes to improve efficiency with rescuing people and escape routes for normal citizens.\" While the app is purely a concept at the moment, Mr Vale said in practice people would provide basic details about themselves, their lifestyle and where they live which would be provided, with consent, to emergency services when a \"distress beacon\" is activated. The app would also create a map for the user of the area they are in, and anywhere they want to check if they are planning a trip. Affected areas would be highlighted in a colour code, with fire showing as orange, flooding blue, landslides green, avalanches white - solid colours for ongoing disasters and striped for predicted ones. \"If a person gets into danger, especially in a region that has no internet or signal, then by pulling down on a bar at the top of the screen within the app a button will appear that states 'I need help',\" Mr Vale said. \"Upon pressing this button, the GPS coordinates, as well as the basic information the user provided, will be sent out to the nearest emergency service, to allow them to act quickly upon the issue. \"Ideally, some functionality would exist where, for example, should certain criteria be met in the case where a person has been rendered incapacitated or unconscious and cannot manually activate the distress signal, the phone will do it automatically.\" But he added the app concept was not perfect - and would need expert help. \"I understand there is a potential for abuse within this, as well as the general idea, but would want to work with the experts to find ways of reducing the capability for abuse whilst maintaining the immediate and autonomous nature of the function. \"It is a certainty that there are going to be disasters or potential hazards that are going to be missed, 100% effectiveness cannot be guaranteed. \"So I would like to see the ability for people who travel to take photos of things they have seen that have not been picked up by the app and post them on a 'bulletin' for others in the area to look at.\"", "If you have a picture you would like to share, please see below the images for details on how to submit yours.

Investment in offices alone slumped from \u00a3500m in 2014 to \u00a330m in 2016. Knight Frank said the low oil price \"continued to take its toll\" in the north east, with few deals going through in 2016. But it added that market conditions could improve in the year ahead, with crude prices making a recovery. The report found investors spent nearly \u00a31.8bn last year across all sectors in Scotland, including offices, hotels, shops, student accommodation and industrial units. The figure was 12% down on the previous year but above the 10-year average of \u00a31.72bn. Edinburgh registered a particularly strong year for investment, with almost \u00a31.2bn transacted across all sectors - 92.5% up on 2015. But Glasgow saw a \"more muted\" 12 months, with transaction volumes down by 59% at \u00a3280m. Alasdair Steele, from Knight Frank, said: \"Overall, the Scottish commercial property market remained resilient, despite an unstable 12 months. \"Across the country, political uncertainty has influenced investment levels over the last year. \"However, there's a general feeling beginning to emerge that Scotland offers good value and strong fundamentals - an attractive proposition for investors seeking solid returns at an especially turbulent time. \"We'd hope to see that reflected in transaction volumes picking up in 2017, provided the political climate remains stable.\" Meanwhile, a separate report has suggested that investor interest in Scotland's commercial property market has failed to pick up despite an increase in occupier demand. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) said both domestic and foreign investment inquiries stayed in negative territory in the last quarter. At the same time, the supply of property for investment purposes fell across all sectors. Some surveyors described market conditions as \"challenging\". The latest Rics UK commercial market survey suggested increased demand from occupiers in the office and industrial sectors. But it was a different story for retail in the fourth quarter, with a net balance of 14% more chartered surveyors reporting a fall in demand for retail space. Gavin Anderson, from Montagu Evans in Glasgow, said: \"The current economic outlook isn't looking great and consumer spending on the high street is feeling the effect of growing fears about the economy. \"Hopefully, the anticipated reduction in the rateable value of retail premises from April 2017 will act as a catalyst to help retailers' profit margins across their shop portfolios and increase their confidence to expand and take more stores next year.\" Rics chief economist Simon Rubinsohn said: \"The results for the survey suggest that the commercial property market in Scotland has failed to attract investor interest despite an increase in occupier demand for commercial property in the last quarter. \"This may be due, in part, to the prospects for the economy and the political situation more generally.\"", "He was detained at his home in Moscow earlier on Monday, ahead of anti-corruption demonstrations in Russia. Hundreds of people were held during the gatherings across the country. Riot police in central Moscow were picking protesters out of the crowd at random, a BBC correspondent at the demonstration has said. A court in Moscow announced its verdict late on Monday, rejecting demands by Alexei Navalny's defence lawyers to drop the case. The 41-year-old opposition leader later confirmed this in a tweet on his Twitter page (in Russian). Mr Navalny, who intends to stand for the Russian presidency next year, had been due to attend the unauthorised rally in the capital earlier on Monday. OVD-Info, an independent NGO, said that 825 people had been detained at the protest in the capital. Police in Moscow say about 5,000 took part in the demonstration there, Interfax news agency reports. OVD-Info also said that hundreds of people were held in St Petersburg. Russia's interior ministry says about 3,500 people attended the protest in the north-western city, and 500 were detained. This was a peculiar protest. At first it was hard to tell who was taking part. Tverskaya Street was full of families marking Russia Day with entertainers in historical costumes. Then thousands of protesters turned up. Huge numbers of riot police were right behind them. First they announced that the rally was illegal then the arrests began. We saw dozens of people plucked from the crowd - many of them young - and dragged roughly towards police buses. By calling people to an unauthorised rally, Alexei Navalny knew he was risking a confrontation. The police duly obliged. But people I spoke to said they knew the risk and still wanted their voices to be heard. Among other things, those voices chanted loudly: \"Putin, thief!\" and \"Russia will be free\". In a live broadcast by the Russian liberal TV channel, Dozhd, protesters in St Petersburg could be heard shouting \"shame\" as they were detained by police. Among those arrested was Maxim Reznik, the city's legislative assembly deputy. Prominent activist Daniil Ken said he was arrested as he left his home in St Petersburg. He urged people to join the rally at the city's Champ de Mars square. \"Go for me, please!\" he tweeted. He has since been released. Police had earlier detained several people at demonstrations in the cities of Vladivostok, Blagoveshchensk and Kazan. Mr Navalny called on Russians to take to the streets on Monday - Russia Day - to express their anger at alleged corruption at the highest levels. The anti-corruption campaigner uses YouTube, tweets and blogs to reach new audiences. A video posted in March accuses Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev of accumulating a vast private fortune. Mr Medvedev denies the claims. The video, which includes the accusation that the PM has a duck house on one of his properties, has been viewed nearly 23 million times. In a call for people to join him on Monday, Mr Navalny wrote: \"I want changes. I want to live in a modern democratic state and I want our taxes to be converted into roads, schools and hospitals, not into yachts, palaces and vineyards.\" Mr Navalny was earlier granted permission to hold a rally at Sakharova Avenue but changed the location - without permission -  on the eve of the demonstration to Tverskaya Street, near the Kremlin. The protest was called over government plans to demolish Soviet-era apartment blocks in the city. Permission was granted for demonstrations in 169 locations across the country, some of which were broadcast live on the Navalny Live YouTube channel. The protests coincided with a series of official events - including festivals, concerts and military enactments - taking place across the country to mark Russia Day, the national holiday dedicated to the 1990 declaration of sovereignty. Similar rallies led by Mr Navalny in March led to hundreds of arrests. Those protests were the largest since 2012, drawing thousands of people - including many teenagers - to rallies nationwide, angered by a report published by Mr Navalny that accused Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev of corruption.", "The move is part of Police Scotland's cost-cutting plan to centralise control rooms. If a decision is taken at a board meeting on 22 March it is thought likely that the centre will close quickly afterwards. SPA chairman Andrew Flanagan said he had been consulting widely on the move. He told BBC Scotland: \"I think there are a number of local concerns about the closure. It's important we take account of local concerns. \"We need an assurance it's going to be effective.\"", "The 36-year-old Czech national was arrested on Saturday after the body of Rebecca Johnson, 26, was found in the Finnish village of Kuttanen. Ms Johnson was a member of the Santa Safari team which works with tour operator Transun Travel to organise Christmas-themed excursions to Lapland. The couple lived in Scotland before moving to the Arctic for seasonal work. Ms Johnson was from Burntisland in Fife. A Finnish police statement said: \"Lapland District Court has today imprisoned the suspect of the homicide, according to the claim of the Lapland Police Department. \"A 36-year-old Czech citizen is suspected of killing his 26-year-old long-term partner. The victim is a female citizen of Scotland. The crime is investigated as a murder.\" It is understood members of Ms Johnson's family have since travelled to Lapland. The police statement said: \"The suspect has been co-operative but hasn't been able to clarify a specific motive for his suspected act. \"Police will continue the investigations by hearing the witnesses and the suspect, and by conducting technical investigations.\" The suspect was arrested on Saturday after fleeing into the Lapland wilderness on a dog sled. The police operation involved a helicopter and officers on snow scooters in temperatures of -30C. The man was said to have been suffering from hypothermia when he was found.", "Prices rose 0.8% in the month compared with 0.1% in November. Overall in 2015 house prices rose by 4.5%, with the average price of a property in the UK now at \u00c2\u00a3196,999. Separately the Land Registry for England and Wales reported that prices rose by 5.6% in the year to November. It said the average price of a house or flat was \u00c2\u00a3186,325. Nationwide said the growth in house prices broadly matched growth in average salaries, adding that it expected to see a similar pace of growth next year. Rival lender Halifax calculates that prices are rising twice as fast. Its most recent survey suggested that prices went up by 9% in the year to November. London remained the strongest performing region for the fifth year running, with average prices up 12% compared with a year ago, according to Nationwide. But it did not expect house prices in the capital to continue to see above average growth next year, pointing to the fact that property was becoming unaffordable for many in the city. Average prices in the London are now 50% above their pre-crisis peak in 2007, while in contrast property values in Northern Ireland remain 44% below their pre-crisis peak, despite rising by 6.5% in the last three months of the year. Across the UK as a whole, prices are around 7% higher, Nationwide added. Scotland was the only part of the UK that saw a fall in average house prices, with values down 1.9% in the three months to the end of December compared with the same period a year ago. Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist, forecast average house prices would accelerate at a modest pace, despite the likelihood of interest rate rises from the middle of next year. \"Further healthy gains in employment and rising wages are likely to bolster buyer sentiment, while borrowing costs are expected to rise only gradually. However, the main concern is that construction activity will lag behind strengthening demand, putting upward pressure on house prices and eventually reducing affordability,\" he added. Overall, Mr Gardner forecast average house price growth of between 3% and 6% nationally in 2016. He also raised concerns about regional variations in house prices, linking strong house price growth in some regions to higher rates of employment growth. \"The gain in employment in London is particularly striking, with the number of people in employment up 14% compared to the pre-crisis period,\" he added. Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight forecast house price growth of 6% in 2016 supported by continued buyer interest and shortage of available properties as well as healthy wage growth and levels of employment, relatively high consumer confidence and still very low mortgage interest rates. But he warned that average house prices would \"be constrained by more stretched house prices to earnings ratios, tighter checking of prospective mortgage borrowers by lenders and the probability that interest rates will start rising gradually during 2016\".", "Spain's Marta Corredera curled the hosts into an early lead before England striker Dan Carter doubled their lead moments later. Alex Scott made it 3-0 straight after half-time, before Kirsty Linnett pulled one back for the visitors. Three-times winners Arsenal will now face Notts County Ladies in the final at Rotherham on 1 November. In a repeat of the 2011 and 2012 finals, Arsenal made an energetic start and Carter struck the crossbar before Corredera's sweet strike from the edge of the area opened the scoring. Carter than raced clear, one-on-one with Sophie Baggeley, and calmly lobbed over the Birmingham goalkeeper. The Blues responded well to falling two-goals behind but Karen Carney's deflected shot was turned on to a post by Sari Van Veenendaal, and bounced back across the face of goal and clear. After the break, Arsenal made the win safe with Scott's powerful finish, before Linnett's well-struck consolation. In a bad-tempered second half, Carter drilled wide after a superb knock-down from Jordan Nobbs late on, but a two-goal cushion was sufficient to see Arsenal through. Arsenal manager Pedro Martinez Losa told BBC Sport: \"We have been starting games well. I'm very happy with that. \"The best feeling today is to offer the fans victories in the last three home games of the season. I'm proud of the players, the staff and the team. \"This is the reward for everybody's efforts. We have to do everything possible between now and the final to prepare.\" Birmingham manager David Parker told BBC Sport: \"Arsenal were the better side in the first half, that's won them the game. \"Defensive errors and mistakes in that first 20 minutes were the difference. \"Looking at the second half display, for long, long periods we were the better side and we really showed our quality.\" Arsenal Ladies: Van Veenendaal, Scott (c), Stoney, Losada (Yankey), Natalia (Ubogagu), Nobbs, Carter, Williamson, Corredera, Rose, Janssen (Sampson).

Archaeologists who have been monitoring the building of the West Link displayed some of the items at Lochardil Primary School last week. The new road is being built for Highland Council to ease traffic flow through Inverness. The finds include Bronze Age burnt mounds. The mounds are large piles of burnt waste, often including ashy deposits and stones that have been shattered by heat. They are usually horseshoe-shaped and found close to streams, and archaeologists say that they are the product of repeated events of burning. The mounds are connected to the heating up of stones which were then placed in water-filled pits to heat water, possibly for use in cooking, washing wool or even as small saunas.", "Kim Wall, 30, was last seen on Thursday evening on board the vessel with the owner, 46-year-old Peter Madsen. The submarine later sank and Mr Madsen was rescued before being arrested and charged with manslaughter. The stricken vessel, the Nautilus, has been raised but no body was found and the search for Ms Wall goes on. Mr Madsen initially said that he dropped Ms Wall off before it sank but police say he has now changed his statement - although they have not said what to. Police gave no other information on why they thought the Nautilus was deliberately sunk, but it contradicts Mr Madsen's explanation that there was a technical fault. Mr Madsen has denied involvement in Ms Wall's death, and will be held in custody for 24 days while investigations continue. Ms Wall's boyfriend first reported her missing after she failed to return from what should have been a short trip on the submarine. She had been writing about Mr Madsen and his submarine, which at one stage was the largest privately-made vessel of its kind. Police are still appealing for witnesses who may have seen Ms Wall on Thursday evening. \"We're still hoping that we'll find Kim Wall alive, but we are preparing  ourselves for the fact that she may not be,\" Copenhagen police homicide chief Jens Moller said.", "He said he was disappointed that judges ruled ministers could not invoke Article 50 - starting formal Brexit negotiations - without MPs' approval. Mr Cairns was at a breakfast meeting with business leaders in Cardiff. Welsh Conservative MP David Davies warned attempts to block Brexit could lead to an early general election. Mr Cairns told BBC Wales that there was an \"obligation\" on politicians in all UK parliaments to give firms certainty about the UK's departure from the European Union. \"What investors and employers want is the direction of travel and that's what we're focused on,\" he said. The UK government has said it intends to appeal against Thursday's High Court ruling. First Minister Carwyn Jones has said that would be a mistake, but on Friday the Welsh Government announced it would apply to have a voice in the appeal. Mr Cairns claimed the UK was in a \"strong position\" on the Brexit negotiations as it had one of the world's fastest growing economies. He said he wanted to work with the Welsh Government to get \"a good deal\" for Wales, and also wanted to work with Europe. \"It's in our interests that Europe grows and it's in Europe's interest that the UK and Welsh economies grow,\" he said. Mr Davies, MP for Monmouth and chair of the Welsh Affairs Select Committee, warned that politicians seeking to keep the UK in the EU would now use the judges' decision to try to block Brexit. \"There'll be members of parliament looking to find excuses and flaws in the legislation that the government bring forward and the negotiation package, if you like, to try and vote against it,\" he told BBC Radio Wales. \"This is all about trying to undo the result of the referendum - let's be in no doubt about that.\" He added: \"This could easily lead to an early general election if that's what it takes to get this sorted out.\" But Labour's Shadow Welsh Secretary Jo Stevens said Parliament now needed to do its job and scrutinise the UK government's approach to Brexit. \"How we leave the European Union was not on the ballot paper and there are a number of ways in which that could happen,\" she told BBC Radio Wales. \"There's no consensus on that yet because the government haven't yet disclosed any details of how they intend to approach both the negotiations and the end point when we leave the EU. \"So of course Parliament should scrutinise those plans - that's exactly what Parliament is there to do. \"The court decision yesterday simply says, as we all knew, that Parliament has a clear role - a legal role, a constitutional role and an incredibly responsible role to try and influence how that exit happens.\" However, Pontypridd Labour MP Owen Smith told the BBC's Daily Politics programme he could \"potentially\" vote against the triggering of Article 50 in a Commons vote. \"Most [Labour] colleagues feel that we couldn't possibly do anything other than trigger Article 50 - I disagree with them,\" he said. \"If we have no further clarity as to whether Britain is going to be better or worse off as a result of the ending of the negotiations then I think the right thing for me to do on behalf of my constituents is not to vote to make them worse off.\"", "The conditions endured by chainmakers and their demands for a minimum wage caused a national scandal and in 1910 they held a strike. It lasted for ten weeks and is credited with changing the lives of thousands of workers earning poor wages. Artist Luke Perry, from a family of chainmakers, has created the statue after more than two years. Mr Perry's statue was unveiled on Friday morning in Mary Macarthur park, named after the trade unionist who led the women chainmakers 102 years ago. He said: \"It's something which is a wonderful piece of our history, but still, I don't think enough people know about it.\" The statue stands at 10 ft (3 metres) and weighs nearly three-and-a-half tonnes. The area's links with chain making are kept alive every month at a rare surviving chain shop at Mushroom Green in the heart of the Black Country. In 2010, a plaque honouring Mary Macarthur was put up in the park as part of the 100th anniversary events.", "Mr Philippe, 48, was arrested after appearing as a guest on a radio programme in Port-au-Prince last week. He was flown to the US to face the long-standing charges. Dozens of his supporters attended the hearing in Miami, demanding his release.

We all feel like he is innocent,\" said Haitian Senator Evince Francois. \"We are here to let him know we stand up behind him. We think this is all politics,\" he told the Associated Press news agency. Until last week, the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) listed Mr Philippe as a wanted man on charges of conspiracy to import cocaine and money laundering His arrest, on 5 January, came days before he was due to be sworn in as a senator, which would have given him some immunity from prosecution. Campaign group Human Rights Watch has accused him of overseeing extra-judicial killings. Mr Philippe, Haiti's former police chief, denies any wrongdoing. He took part in the 2004 rebellion that removed President Jean Bertrand Aristide from power.

Christmas Eve. The image of the man on the floor of a shop doorway in Liverpool city centre was published on Facebook on 24 December. It was shared more than 5,000 times before it was deleted. The GoFundMe page - set up by Michael Ward, who took the photo - has raised more than \u00a3300,000, with donations flooding in from around the world. The JustGiving page - set up by a family friend of the man - has raised more than \u00a320,000. The man, believed to be in his 30s, was sleeping rough in Liverpool city centre for about a year before the photo was taken, Mr Ward said. \"He was just lying there and looked so vulnerable and cold. He had a sleeping bag and a bit of cardboard,\" he said. \"I just felt so sorry for him.\" Mr Ward, who works for Liverpool's LFC TV, said he felt compelled to do something for the man. \"The reaction

(MoD) said the change will mean those with the most severe disabilities will be looked after for life. The decision follows a review by Lord Ashcroft, a Conservative peer and philanthropist. It means about 5,000 personnel will be eligible for a package of support worth up to \u00a3570,000. The MoD said the new scheme would be phased in over the next two years, in parallel with the existing arrangements. It said the new system would provide \"greater financial certainty\" for those who had left the Armed Forces and had suffered life-changing injuries and illnesses. A spokesman said: \"These reforms will mean that the most severely injured personnel will be better off as a result of the changes. \"This is the right thing to do for those who have been injured and have given so much to our country.\" The MoD said the new system would help those with the worst life-changing injuries, including loss of limbs, to be able to \"plan their lives knowing that they will receive a guaranteed tax-free and inflation-proof level of support, for the rest of their lives\".

The documents were found in a police station in the city of Iguala, where 43 students went missing in 2014. The remains of only one of the 43 has been positively identified. The case sparked international outrage and mass protests. The documents, dated to the time of the disappearances, appear to show that a military unit was based in the area at the time of the disappearances, despite the president's insistence that his troops had nothing to do with the incident. The documents show that the 27th Infantry Battalion, from the nearby town of Chilpancingo, was deployed to Iguala on 26 September. The students disappeared the next day, after clashes with police. The government insists the military was not there to stop the students travelling to Mexico City, but to combat a surge in violence in the region.

Alex Younger said IS's attempt to \"erase borders\" between countries meant it was more dangerous than al-Qaeda. He also said that Russia was trying to \"undermine our ability to collect intelligence\". Mr Younger said the IS group was \"a coherent, self-declared enemy of the UK and we have to treat it as such\". Speaking in his first interview since taking over as chief of the Secret Intelligence Service, Mr Younger said he believed IS's \"unique proposition\" was a \"fundamental threat to our way of life\". \"It's trying to erase the border between war and crime. It's trying to erase the border between internal and international affairs. It's trying to use violence to fill a gap in its legitimacy,\" he said, adding that it was a \"fundamentally different threat\" to that posed by al-Qaeda. He said the threat from IS was \"more acute and immediate\" than previous terror threats, such as the IRA, but that the situation was not \""], ["A New Zealand child has won NZ$1m ($723,000;
